Hello my name is Ken Thamann and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio's
Community News for the month of July 2012. This is a regular show that we do
once a month to give you an idea of what's going on in the community, what's
going on behind the scenes of the community, around HPR. We will start off with a
show review and then we'll move on to a long list of tanks and apologies and
other notes that I want to talk to you about because they were on my inbox and I
haven't done the community news for the last while so I want to make sure that I
didn't miss anything so I went through all my email today and medallist
scaringly large list of thank you's and apologies. Okay as we always do we
will go through the shows that were on last since we had the last
community news. I'd like to thank Latu for doing an excellent job on
community news for June and the following day we had syndicated Tuesday which
is done from the Linux and the Shell project. Episode 10 was the DF
command exploring file system usage and I'll say it before and I'll say it
again some of these are more obscure commands and some of them I think while
I'm really going to know everything about this command and then he ends up in
every show so far pulling out something out of the man pages that I am
completely overlooked and yeah so fantastic work there Dan thank you very
much for all the shows that you've you've sent in and we appreciate all the
work and just so people do know that for every one of those shows there's a
complete write-up tutorial on the website and there's a complete video as
well all of which are really worth looking into. The following day we had
Ugandike who gave us a show entitled about Rivendell with Rivendell and this
was I was listening to this show on the way back from work and was very very
very impressed with what this application would do even the slick in and out
promos the choice of music was excellent they the whole way that the
whole thing was put together I think he set off to prove that you could do a
podcast with Rivendell absolutely definitely probably if somebody can
package it make it a little bit easier to install it would it would kind of help
but definitely an experiment that went very very well and I heard the
Sunday morning Linux review people was listening to the show as well and they've
picked out a one of the songs that was used in that show well the next day
obviously we had the massive unbelievable binary and hexadecimal celebration of
our 1,000 and 24th or our 1,324th episode depending on how you look at it and
want to really thank 5150 who did an awful lot of work organizing that and all
the other guys who who you know joined and really met at a very enjoyable show
to listen to and a lot of the links that they put together there in the
background are on the on the website and thank you Mr X for the accordion
intro and outro music so yeah that's monumental and I'd like to thank
especially everybody all the hosts and all the various different people who
have worked on HPR and made it such a success that it is and looking forward to
the next 1 or 2 4 episodes and the following day was a syndicated Thursday on
a Friday there's been a few odd ones like that this month as well and I wanted
to release this one because it's the Infonomicon episode 51 I haven't been
able to get troops on really I had done an interview with Stank to give the
lineage of Hacker Public Radio we played as well the last episode of Radio
or a radio freak America where they mentioned the Hacker Public Radio project
that they were all going to switch to and I kind of never happened I think they
probably had something else in their mind them what transpired but it was for me
Infonomicon was the way that I got to a tech and subsequently got attacked
Republic Radio and I played episode 51 it was actually the shortest of all the
episodes of Infonomicon and they did 52 episodes I think and they they were
some politically incorrect but very very funny episodes on troops and troops
was also one of the early people behind it started off as troops radio
Infonomicon did and then migrated into into the Infonomicon podcast
troops was also one of the original correspondence on Radio
Freak America a few of his emails were were there and were read out and it was
I think inspired by that the troops went ahead and started its own podcast
spreading the word tackers spreading information spreading knowledge and it
was he stopped Infonomicon when Tuas started up and Tuas is a direct
successor so it was a name change really and that made Tuas tech turn into
Hacker Public Radio just in case you don't know so that was it a little bit of
history and that's that's probably the the end of the catch up reminiscing
shows that we're gonna do for a while on this something comes out of the
woodwork you never know what will happen here at Hacker Public Radio and then
we went to the following day or following Monday was setting up a WordPress
blog part four Frank Bell who's now our official WordPress administrator here
in Hacker Public Radio and Rachel's again I think I know I'm gonna know a lot
of stuff about WordPress or about the topic and he just comes along
and keeps giving you more information and that's kind of the whole point the
next day was an episode that I did myself about migrating away from Google
reader and I guess it's becoming a little bit of a topic here on Hacker Public
Radio and we had of course the interview with the founder of DuckDuckGo
which is a search engine that I've been using essentially since then and it's
an adequate replacement if not yeah sometimes you can go
exclamation mark w and here was another one of Google's products that I
personally was using quite a bit and that is Google reader and essentially the
show was about how to replace Google reader with a nine-map which actually has
turned out to be a lot more convenient for me myself because I have the
nine-map available natively on so many different platforms email line
supported so that kind of worked for me also got a mention on the command line
.net as well they were considering that and decided against it the following
day we had Jonathan Culp and NYU Bill doing Goodwill hunting where they were
looking for you know going around Goodwill stores charity shops and getting
all technology a great episode for yeah rooting out that's a classic old
computer so have a listen to that and it's a it's another great way to find
technology the next day was syndicated Thursday series and we had one of the
episodes put together by Robin Gattling from the full circle podcast and he aired
the Karen Sandler medical devices one aside from being the head of the GNOME
project and a lawyer she also has a heart which comes a bit of a shock to
people who know all the lawyer jokes but she has a heart condition and had some
proprietary software put in so very thoughts stimulating and well worth a
listen it was one of the shows at a camp that generated the most stir I think
you will be seeing a lot of the odd camp interviews coming up over the next few
weeks and the reason for that is it's been a year since I'll camp happened and at
the time we didn't have any predefined rule we did have a discussion prompted
by that and how we would handle episodes coming from shows and events and at
the time the decision well but a month after the time a decision was taken by
the community on the mailing list to to reserve a block of shows after the
event so after a camp 12 we'll be reserving a week of shows where if they
get filled they will be bumped to the top of the queue so we'll get quite a lot
of the shows out of the way in that first block and then later on during the
year we'll schedule the shows as normal ones if they're not that time-sensitive
or as regular syndicated Thursday slots if there happened to be interesting
talks so in an effort not to get lynched when I go over there I want to make
sure that all the shores actually are aired before I go over to odd camp the
following day we had Robin and Ruben Rodriguez talk about Trisk Galilinix and
again this was another in the syndicated Thursday slots deep geek was
unsybatical so we had a fresh slot and I wanted to make sure that we would
bump some of these talks up the queue as well the following Monday we had
Brockton Bob with a how to backup your DVD collection using Memcorder probably
not legal in some jurisdictions believe it or not where fair use does in the
play but we laugh in the face of illegalness here in Hacker Republic radio
not all obviously it's for educational purposes and what's may may not be
legal in your jurisdiction there is some comments on that on the website which
would be another you know options for the VF part I myself lazy and use
handbrake for copying my DVDs over so there you go but always interested to
hear what what commands you can use to do this because you don't try to get
the best possible quality then we had the DU command from Linux and the
Shell and the following day we had the first episode by a paranoid Shell who was
suggesting that I think not paraphrasing too much that while the RTFM is
probably not very positive at the same time some people should actually read
a lot more than they can and then they do and some people don't actually want
to learn and then we had Mike Kingley who gave a very detailed response to that
and I think he'd even prompted him to do a an episode on that which will come
into the queue shortly the next day my pixie book episode came up where I
tried to get a compact HP compact T5000 thin client working and I'm going to
echo here you know it's essentially how to the episode was about how to
pixie boot over a network and it is a convenient way sometimes you know an
alternative way than burning DVDs to get an operating system onto your
computer that you might think about that was kind of the point but this whole
project has been so jinxed I've had for many years they desire to get a thin
computing silent computing into the living room starting with some Java
stations which I had Linux on with a Vian M9000 PC that died after 24 hours of
use with this which presented every possible problem under the sun and
eventually I did get a working just on the day that my Raspberry Pi arrived
and I plugged it in and boom everything worked far faster and also for 35
dollars I really don't want to promote especially after the two episodes on
reusing computing but I also replaced my own server of eight years and four
days running with the Rasp with that Raspberry Pi and you really do have to
take into account the amount of power being wasted as well in in reusing
this technology so it's it's an interesting topic it's a it's a balance but
that that whole project has been jinxed from lower go anyways the following day
was another syndicated Thursday on a Friday I have no idea oh yeah I did I was
on the train and I posted that I thought it was Wednesday and it turned out to be
Thursday so Thursday became Friday all right just go with the flow it's they
I'll camp a level panel discussion and they was also talking about the MQ
telemetry transport which was one of these episodes where I find it really
interesting but I have the feeling that so much is going over my head but I
really enjoyed it and episode 10 36 the following Monday was Joel and Joel I am
getting really really annoyed with you and mr. gadgets for that matter and the
reason I am is because we've got two people on ham radios and I want to hear you
guys record a show over a ham radio please get it together and make it happen
but the reason I'm annoyed with Joel is this is a seriously excellent episode and
dangling in front of me yet another hobby where I think yes I really should have
a ham radio when the when the dykes crash here and the and the floods come and
I'm up in my attic desperately cranking up a ham radio or something so yes thank
you Joel yes you food for thought and the following day if I don't get to if
I don't get to buy my ham radio I might be up there soldering it together following
the excellent episode by mr. X on soldering and who could have thought something so
so painful could make such an interesting show and thanks very much for the
very detailed show notes as well and I really do appreciate it when people send
in good show notes with the links and everything it's it's just really a lot
less work for me to do and I really have the feeling that you're highlighting
the things in your show that you want brought brought to the fore then they
episode 1038 was an interview with the guys behind the
Salix OS project which is a slackward derivative didn't actually know that much
of ours until I heard this show by Poké and it was a really really good
interview and kind of almost made me want to try slackward again I'll put it on
the list of things that I really want to do and then we had again syndicated
Thursday we had the Matalie by from the GNU FM and the Libre FM projects and
that was recorded at the North East GNU Linux Fest and there's quite a few of
them and in the queue as well so we need to horse through them because of all
these shows in the queue we've respectfully asked that the Sunday morning
Linux review won't be taken out of the queue temporarily and we've also the
nightcast has also temporarily been removed from the syndicated Thursday queue
you know it's essentially so we can get through this backlog and we do
appreciate those guys put them in but both of those shows are more than capable
of standing on their own now they're both very popular shows in their own
right and we also had a little bit of a bump here for the next show which was
a kind of time-sensitive news of discussion on the fact that after all these
years steam finally comes to Linux doesn't matter to me at all because I know
interesting gaming whatsoever after losing many many hours of my life to the
Lemmings and yes I know there is a Linux variant of that where they have
penguins falling off cliffs but yes a mallard dragon glut and downer did
next and show their brought up even some concerns over licensing and and all
the rest that good stuff then we had another bump show for the reasons given
earlier that if somebody's going to go to a show repertoire physical event we
especially if they're gonna have a booth there and be talking we are going to
prioritize that over other shows that have been submitted to the queue and this
was one of them where the guys got together after hope and there's even
talk of them having a booth at hope the next one which would be absolutely
fantastic again the next day Linux in the shell the tail command and tail
minus n plus 30 thank you Dan thank you thank you thank you thank you for
that that is such such a useful command and not only why because you can use
grip to find a particular instance in the file so I know what line over it is
so you can have grip search for something in a file and it's you know it's a
line 5172 and then you can tail after that and the number of lines with the
dash n plus 572 whatever it is and then tail that again or head that with
taking 50 lines so you want 50 lines after the first time you find that and
they really really long file absolutely fantastic the very very moment I
found out about that I put it into scripts so really appreciate Dan thank you
for all the work you're doing on that show second-hand computing yes family
con man who that meant nothing to me but Poki Poki knew the handle or at least
new company it was an Nintendo in Japan apparently and about archiving all
computers flea markets and ROM each sales in auctions and all the rest of
that good stuff very very interesting and it's great to see people are archiving
things made me feel a bit guilty about that very day I had just dropped off a
whole box feats load of my old tech because down to the recycling center where
they hopefully recycle it in a in a environmentally friendly fashion at least
it should do we're paying for it but I had finally given up on all these
all computers down in my an old tape drives and dad tapes and all the rest so
I felt kind of guilty about that but I guess I'll have to get over we had
then the following day JWP with on camp 11 by the way a second-hand computing I
just had night wise and I am me saying thank you you know they found that very
interesting and night wise sorry for not getting back to you but my 3G
dongle was just going into the scoop all tunnel as that came up so I got
cut off wasn't been rude or anything there anyway yes second-hand
computing and then on camp 11 we had Oracle Linux our man on the spot
roving reporter all around nice guy mr. JWP and he we had a little interview
and the and what he was talking about was my zoom H2 microphone he expressed
an interest in it and I must yes I must do a review of that sometimes on my
list and his excellent talk on Oracle Linux and I you know it's something you
don't hear a lot about but it's very interesting to it's it's good that
somebody is keeping an eye on that that side of the defense and my
king Lee thank you very much again just like Joel give me something else one of
my recurring hobbies is I'm the de facto gene genealogy cool list I don't
know if that's word for the family as well and I gathered a lot of this
stuff and have been have our own three in grams and that sort of thing so yeah
it's a it's actually a great way to get started in grams is pretty cool too
actually for keeping track of your family tree so that was it that was the
shows for the month a north lot of shows north lot of excellent content here
and hacker and public radio now I want to call out a few people special
thanks for you you won't have a bitchy sorry I as everybody knows I cannot
pronounce people's names so I'm an I really apologize for that but thanks for
the heads up on the wrong CC license we had linked to the wrong CC
license on the website I want to thank David Dave Morris for all the
fantastic work he's doing on the backend system here in Hack and Public Radio
if you want to go to the tutorial site you can see a lot of the stuff that
he's doing there we're working currently now in the scheduling system and we're
going to see how that goes I also want to thank Frank Bell and wait as I butch
or somebody else's name it they are homes and both of whom are doing
fantastic work on the front end they've got a lot to think about there as we
have now decided to drop RSS we being the Royal Wii as in me drop RSS as the
feeding mechanism mechanism between the backend and the front end here's the
idea we're going to somebody uploads a file so be it a wild file or an MP3
file or org file or whatever with the associated metadata in a format and the
format is going to be a the Atom XML format for sure course and the reason for
that is you can do multiple holes sewing at the moment we can't do multiple
holes like in my bill and when they go did a show together or if it's a panel
discussion we can only list either one show one host or we can I have to create a
new host where all their names and that only appears once so it's a bit of a
pain so that's one of the things we want to do and it also supports multiple
entries in the in the same feed so we can have the MP3 the org and the speaks
and and also most importantly it has the date in the correct format year
month day two hours minute seconds and the time zone at the end Zulu
being the correct one and that's so that's what I'm going we're going to be
transferring data between the backend the front end using using an Atom feed
and the Atom feed will be also used when people are uploading shows
it'll be taken in as a blob an Atom feed XML and your file and then that will be
taken by the backend system transcoded put into the scheduling system that's
Dave Morris is working on and then when that's ready to rock it'll be added to
an Atom feed which is then published to the world one of the
worlds being the hacker public radio main website and it'll be that'll be the
the central site that you can get it from but if you want to do embed
they feed somewhere else you could also do that
okay so that's a little bit about that a lot of work has been going on
there not as much as I guess I'd like I need to do a lot more documentation to
explain what the vision is but I'm actually meeting up with Dave
as I'll camp him hopefully we'll have time over a few beers to discuss what's
going on there then I'd like to have a special word of thanks to David
man who's been keeping up my morale over the last month
but also for tracking the keywords in the previous episodes he's going back and
listening to all the shows so I've asked him to make note of you know the show was
about this isn't that and we can also add that to the to the feeds so that if
you're interested in all the shows that we're about I don't know
emmon coder for instance that you you will go back and get those or all the
shows about Linux or all the panel discussions or whatever so
and also I want to thank him for his kind donation towards the HPR banner
they was a HPR banner sponsored by him last month for the U.S
which I think the guy is brought to one of the shows and he's contributed to
get him one of those here for for me who will be going to ag camp have a
mention that I'm going to ag camp yes ag camp is coming up
anyway and I want to also thank Richard Quirin for putting the fantastic
artwork together for that I've done off transfers for the back of some
t-shirts so if there's any of the holes going to ag camp he'll be getting a free
t-shirt from me hopefully as stocks last and stocks are not that many to start
of it and then I want to thank Zoke for his idea and I want to thank
Jonathan Nadu for the control panel script now the apology section my bad
it's been particularly bad these last months but only
first of all deep geek apologies for not announcing that your
was on the full schedule of three months
will start in June he's got a new site over there
if people want to go over to to his website tgtm.us I think
you can have a look at that and also I'd like to apologize for not
announcing that he would be going to hope although I think it was on the
mailing list so hopefully these guys met up
met up with deep geek I want to talk to Windigo for missing the fact that he
was a new host this is exactly my point he was
down here done previous episodes but with other people so this is the first
time he was doing one by himself apologies to Mike Hingley and Dortador
Geek for not sending you the ftp details and if anybody
doesn't have the ftp details please contact
Admin at hackerpolicradio.org and I'll send them on to you again
David Morris Frank Bell and ETHRAIA Homes for not providing
enough information about the website or what I want them to do
in my bill for not putting up your show sooner apologies about that
and there's a big it's quite a lot of people who have
put stuff into the queue I haven't got to it yet I usually do it on
Thursdays, Fridays and so Wednesdays, Thursdays, different Fridays
with a Y forks I'm actually regarding the show on the
Monday I'm one of our nights when she's not working so
but it's kind of been a busy week so anyway so those
don't panic if your show doesn't appear in the
processing queue it should go into the processing queue fairly quick and then
once I have it downloaded transcoded got to show notes together then I put it
into the schedule but I will also put it into the
schedule you know even if I have problems
transcoding it or wherever it'll go in at the same
in the same order that we received it so you know don't panic about that but feel
free to email me if you if for some reason it doesn't come up within
in a few days and the guys hope sent in a photo and that's attached to the
show notes for this episode and they talks about hope
are up and there's a link also on the show notes
and this will come as a shock to many of you but I will be going to
this year and if you'd like to come along we have a booth
took a little while to get organized but thanks to Dan
Lynch for getting that sorted out for me and we have a very limited number of
t-shirts t-shirts stickers were too expensive this time to do so if there are
stickers they will be just printed off on
if a four sheets and you can pull off a few and go on much but you could also
download the sticker the the art and start printing your own stickers
would be grand what I'm hoping to do if I get the time probably won't
is make a little booklet with QR codes for the other podcasts that's around
the Linux link.net just to have something on the
on the booth to give away to people as they walk along
we've been asked to announce by Kevin O'Brien that they're open for
registration for the 2012 Ohio Linux Fest
and if you want to you can go to our
hyalynicsfest.org for its slash register
and finally you'll all be thrilled to be here
the Accessible Computing Foundation fundraiser
spurred on by the massive success of the Hacker Public Radio
all all day marathon put on there by our good friend
and glorious leader Poké we they will be doing a fundraiser for the
Accessible Computing Foundation and it's going to be held on August the 25th
at 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time until 12 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on August
the 26th the event is going to be streamed live at the new
radio for the entire event and they again the
guys over at the Linux Basics Mobile Server where we
are kindly or where we have a room as well kindly sponsored by the
Linux Basics guys they will be doing the
Mobile Server so go to the Linux
uh basic website there's 30 people there in the room at once
and and so what kind of worked well for the Hacker Public Radio was if
the people who wanted to get involved on the conversation went into the room
and then the people who just wanted to listen um dropped out to the stream
that also worked for me as well when i wasn't um actually involved in it
so far they have John O'Bacon from Ubuntu, Zach from the WM project
and uh they the plan is to have one thousand people become a member of the
Accessible Computing Computing Foundation the ACF for two
dollars a month two dollars a month not not even the price of a cup of coffee
in fairness not even you know if you were to go down and look behind your
couch for some cash i guess you would manage two
dollars a month i happen to be a contributor and a proud
member of the ACF so please feel free to do that
um things would be bad if you couldn't afford two
dollars a month and if you can't well very sorry about just
send me your name and i'll fire you off some stickers
not a worry um so there you go that's uh that's all about that
it's only 50 cents a week they're saying and um so it's important also that
for as many people as possible to join this foundation
because that um also uh strengthens their
um case to become a charity and hopefully it will then spread the word
um about accessible computing and we need it and the reason we need it
because it's right it's right to have it first start
secondly it will put us at the forefront again
of uh something in the Linux community
in the free and open source community so that's why you need to become a member
if you can't code and if you can't code become a member and
coding start coding okay that is pretty much it and if anybody becomes a member
of the accessible computing foundation and we have any swag
send us a um send us over your email address and
every seat and we will see if we can get you some
hpr stickers or uh buttons or whatever happens to come
your way you will be added to the list of people who have
contributed to that organization okay well that is for now uh
let me just have a quick look here in the queue uh what's coming up
we have um uh let me see second part of soldering mr gadgets makes a
welcome return here uh zoke has discussions about
setting up a Linux charity uh anuka freedom and licensing peg wall
with a dev random uh another cutting the cord
episode oh oh there's so much so much happening here
