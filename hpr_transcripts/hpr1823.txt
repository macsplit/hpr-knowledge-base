Howdy folks, this is 5150 for Hacker Public Radio.
Today I'm bringing you the second of the interviews I got from Cannes Linux Fest, as was
with KLF Organizer, Ryan Sipes.
He's a Systems Administrator with the North East Kansas Library System has been instrumental
to expanding the amount of open source applications that that organization uses.
He is also an organizer of the revised Lawrence Kansas Linux users group.
But a lot of the more interesting things that I found out about Ryan, I found out unfortunately
after the interview is over.
But you're going to have to learn that until after the first beer break, as I've explained
the last few episodes and effort to reduce the inventory of the only beers waiting in my
refrigerator for review.
I've decided that I'm going to add beer reviews to each of my tech episodes.
Hey, nobody complained too much when the meat tree did it.
Okay, the first is from Boulevard Beer Company, which I'm hoping to visit this month,
in Kansas City is their Irish ale.
And one thing they note on the bottle is that there is extra yeast added to the beer during
bottling and after the initial fermentation.
And of course the yeast will eat the remaining sugars in the beer and complete the fermentation
process in the bottle.
All the things that I've always wondered about when other beer reviews viewers mentioned
is a yeasty beer.
I've never really got a handle on that taste.
I think finally perhaps I have.
This beer has sort of a room, spicy, well almost citrusy taste to it.
That could be the hops as well, but I think it's probably untasting the yeast.
Of course I'm also tasting the malt.
Beer pool is a light amber.
It's 30 IBUs.
Alcohol is 5.8%.
So that's not real high, but it's getting there.
Yeah.
Multilist is prominent, toasted, malt, slight roast, hops, moderate, full.
Well, let's see, let's get down to the ingredients.
Let's go into the description.
Okay.
Malts, pale malt, mutic, amber, 50, caro 120, caro 300, and chocolate.
Okay.
I can see a slight chocolate flavor in there.
Hops, maddened, Zeus, Bravo, Sterling, and Sass.
So I really like this.
I'd like to have another one.
Now I'm trying this to an Irishale.
Most of you might have had is Gedus.
Now of course Gedus is a stop, which we distill an ale.
But it's completely a different creature from this beer.
So if you see this, there's perhaps some other craft breweries, Irishale.
I think you'd try it out.
I think you'll be in for a treat.
Okay.
Back to Ryan.
And I enjoyed talking to Ryan about as much as anybody that I met at the Linux Fest.
But after we'd finished the interview, I found out that he's been working on Evolvo-S
with Ike Doherty.
And if you follow Bordador Deaconal, you've probably heard him speak of Ike.
And the energy he has when he gets to working on an open source project.
Unfortunately, I found just a evening in Evolvo-S
and it's involved in some copyright disagreements
and they're going to have to come up with a new name.
Ryan's also contributor to the Vulcan Text Editor, which is written in Vala.
And I want to learn more about Vala.
Well, Ryan failed then for speaking.
We couldn't make it on Sunday afternoon.
And his talk was entitled How to Write a GTK,
slash no application.
But it was pretty much a tutorial in Vala.
And I'm sorry, I missed a good part of that.
But I came at the end and, you know, Ryan's one of the most energetic
and, you know, truly funny speakers that you could ever hope to have.
And I hope to interview him and Ike for a later hacker public radio on Evolvo-S
or whatever Evolvo-S now becomes.
Well, I think at this point, no, I'm sorry, I was going to say at this point,
the best thing to do is let Ryan tell you about himself and his work.
I've forgotten another lonely beer that's been sitting here waiting for me
to finish drafting the introduction.
This is a lucid traveler, grapefruit ale.
Now, a lucid brother is something I hadn't seen till a few weeks ago.
And there's so on a couple of this part of the country,
this grapefruit ale, and then there's a lemon shandy.
Now, if you look on the label,
it says that this beer is brewed with lemon peel and then with grapefruit juice added.
So, what does that make us, folks, remember?
You know, a few weeks ago, when you add fruit juice to a beer,
after it's been brewed, that's called a shandy.
So, grapefruit ale is obviously a shandy as well.
And definitely, tart grapefruit notes coming from it.
It's a beer made with wheat and barley.
I think the best way to compare this beer is to describe this beer
might be in comparison to China's Ruby Redbird grapefruit ale.
And the person who travels definitely sweeter than Ruby Redbird,
but not quite as crisp and refreshing.
Do you want that? I'm not a big fan of grapefruit anyway,
but I have to admit, the grapefruit shandys,
you know, that tart flavor just cuts through and, you know,
it's a very, very refreshing beer, whichever brand you go with.
We see what I've been talking.
I should have been still waving my arms.
I should have been bringing up the tab that has the information.
It's TravellerBear.com. It says,
Malt varieties, two row, melted barley, and melted wheat,
hot varieties. I'm going to mispronounce this.
Halataw dash, Halataw.
Special ingredients for your grapefruit.
Well, since it's a shandy, it's added afterwards.
A full point for APV, so you can call this a session,
or a one more beer.
It says, as people always, you don't get carried away
with it. This would be a really good beer
for outside on a hot day.
Okay, well, that's the second new view.
Without further review, I'd like to take you straight
into the interview with Ryan Sypes from Kansas Selenix Fest 2015.
Howdy, folks, this is 5150 for Hackerpop Public Radio.
And I'm here with Ryan Sypes, one of the organizers of Kansas Selenix Fest.
He's got wider resume.
He's a member of the Lawrence users group,
and open Kansas.
And what's the library system?
No of these Kansas libraries.
They're seven regional library systems in Kansas,
and we're ours in the Northeast corner,
covering Lawrence to pick up all the way up to Hyowatta.
And I understand, Ryan, that enabled the implement,
mostly open software.
Yes, absolutely.
I was fortunate to inherit a wonderful
set of co-workers who embraced open software.
And so there was already a lot of places that we used to use co-hop
or our inner library loan system,
which supports, I think, at this point,
plus libraries.
They use that in their library loan.
That is an open software project.
And also, we are the original people
who bind Kansas libraries on the web,
which is a project that got originally all of the libraries in Kansas
who wanted online with a website.
And we host 200 plus websites on our web servers.
And it's a really awesome opportunity to help these places,
these rural libraries that may not have access to the resources
to create their own website and sign in everything
and manage it to really get up and going.
So it's been a great, great experience for me.
And since then, we've continued that,
since I got on, continued that process of moving
as much as we can to open-source software
and UI Linux and open-source software,
and pretty much every place that didn't pause fit
and found this, it's been of us, not only live,
but also in our ability to stand it
and make it our army.
How long has there been your loan loan?
We started the Linux LoansLinux Group,
probably about eight months ago.
Now, at first, we didn't necessarily have a way of organizing.
I know that past there was a LoansLinux Group,
but whenever I first went to the Loans about two years ago,
I only found a few outdated ages,
talk about the KU Linux users,
the KU Linux Group, and I couldn't find anything up to date.
And I started asking around town,
but being a new resident of town, I didn't know anybody.
And so I just decided one day I got online
and just decided to shoot off into the ether.
I'm Ryan Sipes.
I'm starting the LoansLinux user group.
And if you're interested in, you know,
participating, feel free.
And I ended up getting a lot of good response,
so I started a meetup agent and ever since then,
I've been doing the TIGRO and see a lot of interest.
Now, you mentioned the KFC University of Literary Association.
Is that still active?
Calls over between them?
That's no longer active,
but either the world is a lot of abuse to that.
It turns out that it died when a couple of the town members
got hired away by some pretty big groups.
I know one went out to work at Google
and another one off work, maybe Ed.
I can't remember Twitter or, you know,
some of these big companies they are on the West Coast.
And unfortunately, nobody stepped in to take the reins
and really keep the organize going.
So whenever I first started,
you're a blood-glassy.
Hey, you know these guys, you know?
Are you?
And I was like, no, I just moved to town
and saw if there was a little abuse group, the fact
I didn't start this up.
But we have a lot of members that used to be a part of that.
And this slick spest that we have this house can
has really brought a lot of those people
who I hadn't met yet.
Town were interested in participating.
I would work, and now I'm talking a lot about regularly.
Well, I know about a year ago,
with Mike Paul and to join the Hacker Club Radio,
of course, part of it.
I saw where he found it.
You know, I was pleased to see another Linux user at hands.
I'm all my own town.
I'm about 10 years ago.
I'm 10th to start using it.
Excuse me.
I never went anywhere.
And really, I don't know about your back home,
but the user's Linux.
And today, I've seen more than a hundred here in Kance.
So, you know, I take no absolute,
something to ask me.
What is your 50150?
What is your role in the Kance Slicks Fast?
And I said, absolutely enough.
I've been a little promoted here in the last few weeks.
With that, that, you know.
I said, that's all other people.
The few last fall, when Mike emailed me,
he says, we're actually going to do a Kance Slicks Fast.
I was very, very excited.
Why don't you tell me a little bit of how all of that came?
Well, I don't know if you've interviewed Mike yet,
but he is an extraordinary person.
He comes here supporting open source.
And when it's an open knowledge,
he's got a real passion for free and open source and a knowledge.
And it's really awesome.
I actually, I was trying to think about when I met Mike
for the first time.
And I couldn't come up with the actual moment when I met Mike.
I do know that he had me on Google Plus before I ever met him.
And he was living in Peket time.
And I had no idea who he was.
But I saw him to be like Linux.
So I hit, okay, you know, add him to my friend.
And then he moved the Lawrence.
And that's the part that I don't work.
I don't remember actually meeting him for the first time.
I just remember, he came to one of the Linux user groups.
And I don't think that's the first time I met him.
But from there, he meant something about Kance Slicks Fast.
And I thought, that is not a little idea.
I came from Missouri side of Riddling.
And I knew over there that there was a desire for event like.
And so I said, let's get it started.
Let's see what we have to do.
We, our expectations have been far past now.
Because we were happy we were going to get 20, 30 people in the event.
And this morning when the doors open, I was, I had my fingers crossed.
And then people started rolling in and seats started filling.
And I thought, thank God, you know, this is a great start to what I hope is a recurring annual event that we really show.
That there is an interesting and open event that we're going to possibly let it help grow.
And he mentioned Hack Public Radio as well as some other people who weren't even on my radar for them.
Who were interested and at that point, I thought, if we have to do something.
And since then, it kind of rolled us around.
I know that because you, the, unlike maybe some business events that I've helped plan,
something where I knew who's kind of what demand was and everything.
I had no idea what true demand was, you know, it's area.
But he pointed out at the beginning that where this is the old festival that will be within 12 hours, you know.
And so it's just looking at it that way.
You have Ohio Linux.
You have the one down in text, but he's right.
You know, there isn't really a good conference.
Meet that man.
And so we started planning it.
And we had a couple of people come at multiple planning meetings.
And then eventually we decided we're going to start talking about during the love meetings.
Because that's what we really have people coming out.
And now we're talking to people from Wichita and Manhattan.
And we're hoping that in the future we can have more voices just, you know,
the few of us who are talking online, few of us who are talking in Lawrence,
and actually have full conversations with all of the public can.
Maybe even, you know, a lot of Midwest people on Missouri side too.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
There's a lot of air.
Yeah.
We're doing an interview right now.
Zoom H1.
But, yeah.
Well, it was a podcast.
Sure.
I know a lot of the podcasts they do when they fast get, I mean,
get the other people they talk to each week.
The Linux link text show, they used to start out in the high valley.
All of them in a single room.
You know, they all came from the high valley alone.
They sat down in a single room for years.
And since then, they scattered up down these coasts.
And the overall Ohio.
And so the only time they see each other's when they physically is when they gather the links.
And a lot of times when they've been on a social panel,
necessarily, it's all possible.
That's, as a podcaster, that's kind of what lyrics fast means to me.
I enjoy all the talks.
But I hope at some point, it is by next year or the year after that,
this festival will become well enough known to actually attract somebody.
Some of these guys that I talked to a week from all around the United States.
So that me and you know, going to them, they'll be ahead of this.
Yeah.
I was just talking to somebody not too long ago tonight.
We're at the after party.
You know, there's a lot of people here who are wanting, they're just eager to, you know,
talk about what's going on, what projects they're working on.
And I was really surprised, A, to see the interest from people inside Kansas,
people who are working on projects inside Kansas.
But then I was really astonished by, to see people who were saying,
in the past, I've gone to, you know, Northwest Linux Fest for this.
Or I've gone to Ohio Linux Fest for this.
Or it's to just talk and meet and everything.
And actually what you said really resonates with me,
because what convinced me to create the Lawrence Linux user group was I went to New Orleans
for the Linux Fest, or Linux Con 2013.
And while I was down there, I met three people from Lawrence.
And since then, I've learned there were even more people from Lawrence who were down there.
And I'd never met them.
And I met them.
And I said, you know, I was talking to them.
I said, where are you from?
And they said, I'm from Lawrence, Kansas.
And I said, that's crazy.
I'm from Lawrence, Kansas too.
How do we not know each other?
And I had that happen three times while I was down in Lawrence.
And I was like, it took me going, you know, two planes to get down to New Orleans to meet these people
who were only lived a mile from my house, you know.
And at that point, I was like, we really have to start something up here because
it shouldn't take us traveling, you know, to three or four takes away, you know, the people.
Meet some learning blog.
Please comment your blog.
Meetup.com, Lawrence Linux.
And you can join.
You can join there.
And we tried to, you know, plan the meeting at least a month and then.
Yeah, we're doing interviews.
Well, that's perfect for the audience.
And we're, and you mentioned we're here after party.
We should mention our house.
I was the Lawrence entrepreneur.
Lawrence Center for Entrepreneurship.
And that is run by my good friend, Josh Montgomery, of the Wicked Broadband Initiative here in Lawrence.
They already offer internet service.
And now they've been talking to city about hopefully offering a fiber service to the home.
So residential fiber service, you give it down.
They think, and then the idea behind that is then that, you know, by providing that connection,
that it will spur, you know, the creative forces and the people who are really looking to create great,
awesome businesses, you know, techos-focused businesses.
In Kansas, we'll have to, you know, run off to either be at Kansas City, which is the closer one.
Or, you know, all the way off to the bay or whatever to start their business.
And you wouldn't think that would be a limiting factor necessarily.
But I've talked to a couple of people now who do a lot with media, who say, you know,
it really is a barrier here.
You know, if you don't have a good net, so really get your media and get, you know, your projects out there and circulating it.
And so, really, I've learned a big lesson coming down here from Josh and from other groups down there.
That really, it's a, it's a, we as a community, not just the big, we shouldn't rely on these big companies
to bring us this connection or whatever.
We should be trying to brainstorm ways to get ourselves these connections to be competitive here in the middle, the Midwest,
and also just, you know, brainstorming ways that we can improve our community in that way.
And as the listeners may be suspecting, the entrepreneurial center is sort of a small incubator.
Now, we're actually, in the back part, we're the makerspace.
Now, that's, is that officially a separate organization?
No, no, well, it's kind of cool in the fact that if you sign up, right now, there, there, there, they're offering, you can sign up and you pay $5 a month
if you use the entire facility.
So if you have, if you need help with your business, you can talk, you know, to this side.
But also, you have access to all the makerspace stuff, read readers, any tools that you need to take a, take your idea to hardware or software or whatever it is.
And I think that's really important because by the time you get done with your idea over here in the makerspace,
you may decide, well, you know, maybe I can form, you know, maybe this is a good, a good base for this.
In fact, there is, I just met him tonight.
There's a maker over here and he's been working on re-printers and he manufactures himself and building this town.
So, and it's open to hardware, you know, and so it's, it has the SNF as an aspect, but, you know, it should,
communities need not, as the Linux community, friends, or the open source community.
We don't need to just necessarily narrow our focus to this open software thing we've been writing.
So long, we need to expand our focus to, you know, how can we help open hardware, how to promote, you know, using open source in new ways,
in ways that promote maybe business, or you can, like, the day less here for Twitter was saying,
day, open source has become the most liable platform, you know, build upon.
And we don't want to be anti-biz because we're open source.
We want to help promote that so that we can get open source at the end of many more possible,
and, you know, increase that level of awareness in the world that really work to advance our hearts.
Now, I'll tell you about that.
I recorded a video recipe of 3D printer to manufactures, and I am drawing the blank on the gentleman's cup.
I deaf have that from show notes, if you're the worst general area, and you want somebody to set you up the printer.
I can't, I can't think anybody else because I'm a high-end client separator.
Well, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll see if I can test you a part.
And I just have no name, you know, I've had a few beers at the point.
It's only, oh, in my name, a project.
I, I'm also in, I'm a guy behind it, but I, I address that.
Okay, well, I said, I, I'm just astounded how well this, this is gone.
I looked on the, land your page during, you know, the record tells a couple of weeks ago,
and I know at that time in the press release that I could said something like 200 more, I thought,
to have a bigger little one came, but the land your page was lagging behind it, it said 26.
So, I, you know, I'm certainly glad we've had the, the interest and the quality of speakers.
Yeah, absolutely.
We've had some speakers, we, and sponsors too.
I hate to do a plug of them.
No, please do.
But, the rack space came out and they, they funded, you know, that we, we never, like, was mentioned earlier.
When we started this, we just kind of just said, we'll put up the money, you know, to do whatever,
because it, we're passionate about it.
But now, the response we had is, and the most exciting response we had is, there are a bunch of individual donors.
I want to mention them first, you know, people who are given, individuals who are given money to our cause, you know,
and we're going to say that, you, that for, for some project, we, you know, we're heating out.
We can also, for next cans best, and then we've got donors, rack space, and I'm tout testing,
which is located here in London, you know, end of your test of tests for suits and mobile suits.
My wife was there, and some Mike, who's really led this event.
He, probably the biggest sponsor, who has given so much time and money to the effort, so definitely,
he's brought this from Dreamer Reality.
Along those lines, the Linux pro-maggy, and the Linux culture here in here in town,
given, you know, as they give the mag to give out tenies.
And that was really awesome.
They give every month.
So, we had three different issues.
You got your hands on my grab, though.
And, uh, I aggressive as well.
That's part about it.
Free-spot, heck, couple and events.
So I encourage any of you who are out there who want come to one event, bear in mind that,
not only do you get all the speakers and everything that you would, that you would expect,
but you also get the free-spot, and that's one of that parts.
Yeah, I've finally got enough stickers.
Festoo, my lap off.
Well, a bunch of dick.
Um, obviously another sponsor is Centron Productive, where we're at now.
Um, I'm, uh, the library.
We're in being helped.
They're a sponsor, and they have a great one.
