I'm not kidding.
Hello and welcome to the Upstate Carolina Linux user group podcast.
Let me start one more time.
Hi, Chase.
Hi, John.
How you doing?
Welcome to the Upstate Carolina Linux users group.
Yes, I have room.
You have room?
I wish I had room.
It's cool.
This is Dave.
What?
November the 11th?
2008.
I'm telling everyone what they already know because of those podcasts.
I'd like to say welcome to everyone here.
Thank you all for signing up that someone would come to eat and we've got a huge crowd here
and there's no wonder because we have Dr. Hibb with us today and we're really excited
to have him with us on that island, so I'm listening to his interview on Floss Weekly
for like two or three times.
It's cool.
Now I'm embarrassed.
If you know, those of you that said that you were going to come and eat, we have food
here provided and that is provided by APEX, the solution or systems, APEX systems,
Lyskags and Drew Maldon if you would like to tell us about HX systems, thank you for
your food.
Sure.
Hi, I'm Drew Maldon, like what we said.
I'm a recruiter for APEX systems and established our presence here in the Greenville area.
We have an office in Charlottes where I work out of and we're looking to open up an office
here in Greenville.
Lee is kind of our personal on the ground right now.
He's having some relationships with some business here in the area and we're looking to
really explain it in here and hopefully things really pick up as we go and feel free to
drop by and get a card of mind and be happy to talk with you about the opportunities
that we can provide for you with APEX.
Where's all our opportunities with APEX?
We are an IT staff infirm.
We are a nationwide IT staff infirm where the eight largest, I believe.
And like I was saying, we're looking to expand here into the Greenville area and look into
recruiting people such as yourselves into positions here in the area.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Sure.
If you noticed on the table also I brought my basket from last month.
John Robertson, who is a member of the literature group for at least ten years.
He used to host the website until two months ago, was hosting the mailing list.
If anyone has ever found any of that stuff worthwhile, I would recommend you give it a donation to him.
I'll collect it and give it to him later on.
He was here last week to collect it himself.
Which he said he was going to use to pay for the domain which he's paid out of the pocket for last ten years or so.
But I recommend, you know, if anything on the man, you've ever said something on the mailing list that helps you business wise.
I recommend, you know, whatever it's worth to you.
Put it in there.
Okay.
Let's see.
And Kevin, is he here?
No.
Dave, would you like to discuss, give us an update on Southeast Linux first?
Sure.
If you don't notice, Southeast Linux Fest is an event we're planning.
A group office is not just a small group, but there's a lot of people, hopefully, better out.
It is a Linux Fest that was going to take place on June 13th at Clemson, South Carolina, at the Hendrick Student Center.
And it's in the spirit of the Ohio Linux Fest and the now-deformed Atlanta Linux showcase that took place in the late 90s in Atlanta.
Has it had me, Jeremy?
He's some of the speakers at least.
Paul, thank you.
We've got Paul Freels, the sort of Grand Coovaugh Fedora.
We've got Wade Olson, the KDE's North America Railway.
We've got Ryan Achilles Gordon, who spoke here a few months back.
And if you play the 3D game that's commercially available in Linux, you've used his board pretty much.
We've got Michael the Hand of Red Hat Ghost, things like Funk and Cobbler, that make David Nellie old woman fuzzy inside.
The list goes on.
Wendy Seltzer, former Staff Attorney for EFF, who did things like Defend John Doe and Charter versus RWA and Verizon versus the RWA.
I mean, it's a real rockstar list we've got.
It's going to be a Linux space.
It's going to be a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of people are already mentioning that.
Highland and Specific.
They'll be vendors.
They'll be speakers.
We're going to get two tracks right now.
And we've got a nonprofit status.
We've got a budget.
We've got a vendor perspective drawn up.
We're going to start pushing vendors in the next couple of months.
But if any volunteers, if you go to Wiki.
Got Southeast Linux Fest.org.
There's a page there called Projects.
And we're looking right now for volunteers to help us price some of the expenses.
That we're looking at.
We have a procurement procedure where we're looking at stuff made in the Southeast, stuff made in America, stuff made in the environment.
So if you're interested in helping, please visit Wiki.SaltVaseLinux.org.
Again, that's June 13th next year.
Do you have any regular meetings?
Yes. We have regular public meetings on rc.frino.net and hash Southeast links.
So we want to not clock.
So it's every Tuesday at 9pm.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Thank you.
Let's see.
Check.
Okay.
We tend to go to Indigo.js after if anyone would like to feel free.
We'd like to.
You're welcome to come.
If you're welcome to come, if you'd like.
Oh, yes.
For our guest speaker for now.
Yes.
So please come.
We just kind of hang out and discuss and laugh.
A lot of us go to the.
Hatch Southeast.
We still look for that.
So look extremely geeky.
Yeah.
We just geeky out there.
Yeah.
We care.
It's a sports bar.
A lot of laptops.
It's fun.
Next month.
Yeah.
We're kind of thinking about maybe having a land party in here.
We can discuss on lists.
On the mailing list.
You know, who could.
Supply.
Bring a hub.
Bring.
You know, power cords.
Extra.
Even in cables.
Hubs.
Servers.
You think you can bring a server.
I've got two.
This is good.
2900s.
Okay.
Great.
Play a game.
Please.
Bring a game.
Jeremy, do you think it's going to.
You were going to host the server and.
I think we have enough to be the.
So everyone, bring your your machines in.
And if you don't have a software to start with, you can spend that time.
The new session time on installing some game of the platform.
We can discuss it on the list instead of having to do I know.
You know, bring some stuff.
What's our thing?
You know, it's December.
People may show up, a lot of people don't show up.
People do show up.
They don't normally show up because classes are out
or their work schedule is lighter or whatever.
So December's usually a lax month
and they kind of go to the lab.
All righty, let's see.
I've got an agenda here today.
Today is, as I said, November the 11th.
Happy Veterans Day.
That's exactly where I'm going to go with this.
We are a collection of people that believe in free software
and free software's freedom.
And it's an extension of what we believe as a country.
And I would just like to ask, if anyone here is a veteran,
if you would please stand and let us honor you, please.
APPLAUSE
Thank you all for your service.
You know, we take a lot of the granted, but, well,
you know what I'm saying.
Maybe interior.
I probably shouldn't have finished there, too, by the way.
Was that all shit of fitness?
All right.
So today, we don't say any jokes.
Right, OK.
All right, well, so I said, no one volunteered
for a newbie session.
I was kind of thinking maybe we would have a newbie Q&A
for half an hour versus an auspice of golf very long.
Does anyone have any newbie questions
or anything you'd like to discuss?
Yes.
Yes, I do have a question.
I'm not sure if you can actually.
I don't know.
I'm kind of curious.
As you know, there's different, I guess
if you could say, gooey, available,
tickling, restarting, installation.
And sometimes, if you've got work with clinics,
you don't know what's different, like KDE or GNOME,
look back as well as ice and all that.
Well, I'm kind of curious about, let's say,
that I installed KDE.
Now I want to see what GNOME looks like.
How can that be done?
Without having to reinstall the whole
upper system of KDE.
You can do that, but how depends on which district?
Which district?
Currently, I'm using Open.
I don't know how to do it off the thing.
I don't know how to do that off the top there in the Susan.
Yes, that'll know.
Almost how to do it on Goons here.
Yes, that's all.
Yeah, and yes, you would go to your software control panel.
And you would check the KDE libraries and that sort of thing.
Don't let me be the one who's tall here.
You know what else does?
It's just because I use it every day.
All right, so anyway.
Anyway.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Very well done, Susan.
I was good.
When you log in, and this is pretty normal for any of the XDN,
GEM, KDN, log-in screens, you can change your session
to be GNOME, or KDE, or like my example.
Enlightenment, or a flux box, or XFCE, yes, BWM.
FBWM.
Oh, man.
FBWMaker.
Window maker.
Afterstep.
Let's name some others.
No.
Anyway.
So, but you can do that whenever you're at your log-in pump.
You type your name, and at the bottom left,
you've got sessions.
This is actually very installed at KDE and GNOME.
If you want to choose other window managers
as opposed to desktop environments, KDE and GNOME
are desktop environments.
Wow.
XFCE.
Is XFCE?
OK.
And I remember FBWM95, which was a 95-ish Windows 95-ish look.
And what was it?
You, as, anyway.
But when you go to log-in, you go to sessions,
and change your desktop environment,
or window manager at that point.
You go to the AS software, software management,
and then there is a filter drop-down
when you can change the filter drop-down to selections.
Then you get the groups.
Yes, XFCE.
Next to the GNOME group, next to the GNOME group.
Yes, and if you do the groupings, the groups,
you're going to do a whole lot of lines.
You can start every desktop.
Painful, and it's all in all of those.
And the reason I remember it is that,
because some of the programs were required to keep the libraries,
which they installed by.
But I guess the main thing is that when I was going through a website,
I had the different pictures of what the difference was.
I thought, well, that's kind of cool to try.
But I had to change them.
I mean, it's great.
That's one of the advantages that Linux has.
Change all these different things, but they don't really
get advises to how to change it.
Now, one of the cool things is, is if you install a program
that depends on KD libraries and you're in GNOME,
you can still run it.
It won't finish your desktop environment, look, and feel.
It is to use the vice versa system.
And like me, for example, on Enlightenment,
I've got programs that look KDE-ish and others that
look KDE-ish and so I don't care, because it's better.
Is that a issue question?
That is my question.
Green, did you have question?
Yeah, I guess I did.
I am in an 8.04.
I'm not an adventer.
Upgraded to 8.01.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm already over there.
But I recently had Cabric Surgeon on my right.
I haven't had it done on my laptop yet.
But I had my screen resolution all set.
So it was really big.
OK, it took all my choices, took two choices,
and disappeared.
They are gone.
They're no longer there.
But one that I'm using, and the next biggest one,
is still there.
So I can't go back and change my red and foolish back
dial to the size I need now that I've had my surgery.
So what do I, I mean, if they're a way to get them,
man, driver, you have a way, you could go into MCC,
you could go into AWS, non-GY, GY, environment,
and you could do these.
But I can't say how to do it with the page.
There's a program you can install on Ubuntu called GRNR,
GRNR.
And it will allow you to change the resolution
to anything you really want to.
Do you think we're supposed to do it?
Right, you need to do it.
You know, it's GRNR, and A and D are.
Oh, I'm using this green grinder, I'm sure.
Yeah, the word GRNR, right.
The word GRNR with an R on the end.
What's on Ubuntu you're using?
19.
10.
DPR in the bot setting.
You like it possibly?
Out of 10, you're scoring resolution.
But if you don't get few choices, in this case,
you can make your points much larger by changing the DPR.
Well, I don't need it larger.
Now I need it because I have my third reactant in the system.
OK.
Ah.
I mean, I'm not sure any of the good stuff.
You don't want to have a video card.
You can still change it.
You can have a video card.
Video card.
Yeah, I can.
Actually, maybe the 3010 I think takes a point.
So do you mean you have both drivers with the 3D drivers?
Well, I'm having other issues with the box,
but I don't think it's that great.
Also, because it's made in numbers.
It's constantly just shut down.
We need it.
Over and over.
Do you mean my favorite companies in the sport
do you mean to say?
Oh, I don't think that's your thing.
Now, let's go.
It will come up with that off screen where it says that it's
shut down, restore, to switch to your sport ball.
Just like that.
I have something to do with the rexel work.
But I don't think it's a big bother.
Actually, we need to do that.
All you have to do is start all over and have a video card.
And I wondered if it was an immediate issue.
Yeah.
Have you re-installed your, have you
re-compiled your in the DPR?
Yeah, I did not.
You have an individual card.
I'm getting a new card, so I was waiting for this thing.
I mean, how many do you need to re-install your in the DPR?
I don't think that's down because if you think about it,
you get the higher resolutions you
need to drive or support the lower ones,
even with any D it should work.
Well, if you go from 8.4 to 8.10, you've got the 2.6.27 card.
It has a lot of difference.
I know you guys were here last time.
You saw I was using design and in-player.
And I had to completely change all the configurations
of design and in-player.
My XB didn't work anymore.
I had to go to X11.
I sound changed from something like Alsa to something else.
There's a lot of different things that change.
Sounds like they do affect you as well.
I've seen I've seen 40 years ago.
I've seen you never have done it.
I knew that.
I knew that.
That's one of the other people in this room who did your test.
No, it's the always saying that I was going to get a break chance.
And I come out better.
Questions, dolls are always better with the room.
I wish they had been in all the way.
Oh, yeah.
But it's if you're using Debian testing,
you just keep upgrading every day and everything's happy.
I don't know if they can stay here.
Clearly, this is what you need to do to get.
Well, at least I'm looking not, why not?
How dare I?
All right.
Has anyone got any other than these sort of questions?
I don't know if we really answered.
I mean, you've got some choices now.
Wow.
I would go with that because I actually use a dirty hack
on this laptop using that tool to do external monitor.
So that will give you options outside of the fault options
that are given to you in your configuration knowledge?
No.
It should give you anything your video card supports.
Yeah.
It will also give you the rotation.
It's going to give you a lot of resources with this
to give you the rotation a lot of them
and not use utilities page, which it is.
Yes.
Do you have a question?
Yes.
When I was trying to out a bunch of,
I would do a loop from CD and just fiddle with it.
Then I went ahead and install it.
And I don't know what I did, but...
I thought you could change it back to these books and records.
But I can't, I have to restart it with the CD
and then tell it's been to the records.
That's going to be a bias thing.
Yeah.
And it was...
It would be a bias, and it would be...
What do you mean, re-loader?
Can you turn on your machine?
What happens?
Well, nothing happens.
Through there, grow, grow.
Sometimes I grow up.
I grow up.
I grow up.
Yeah.
I grow up.
I grow up with a Mac.
And that is why there's nothing here.
I just think that I might...
And I don't care.
I don't care.
I'm not mad.
You said I grow up when you went down.
I did it with my nephew.
I think he wanted to come over.
Yeah, where is he?
We're trying to get him here.
Are you saying he was going to be here?
Yeah.
All right, well, I'll get his chicken then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what is that?
We just had a penalty block.
What's the change?
It wouldn't run to step back here.
Are you doing booty?
I was like, there's something wrong with you.
Yeah.
I was not working all of it.
Which...
Which you should probably do is move to CD again.
And then from the command line, grow up.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm a command line grad.
How's that?
So rerun, grow up.
So make a note that the hard drive is placed that it should move from the future.
Yeah.
I agree.
If you have a customizer installed too much, it might not be a bad idea just to run through the install procedure again.
And make sure whenever you run through this time it's going to ask you whether you want to install, grow up in the NBR.
That's the master to move record.
You need to make sure you say yes.
Because if you don't, your bootloader will not work.
That's what we probably missed.
Yeah.
That's the better idea.
Exactly what we missed.
Because it won't let us get back into the line.
Yes sir.
On the same subject.
Devastans, folks, in the group use the great partition installation.
