This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4129 for Thursday the 30th of May 2024.
Today's show is entitled, How I Found Hacker Public Radio.
It is hosted by Henrik Hemrin and is about four minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, another podcast led me to Hacker Public Radio.
Welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
My name is Henrik Hemrin and I am your host today.
My topic today is actually not about experience and knowledge sharing in any Hacker topic.
Instead I want to tell you about how I found this podcast Hacker Public Radio.
When you have listened to my story, feel free to write a comment on the website for
this episode about how you found HPR or record a show about it.
Anyway the reason I found HPR can be traced back to the 1990s when I first heard about
Linux and got interested in Linux.
But it was not until ten years ago that I actually started to try Linux for real.
A friend was enthusiastic about Linux.
Although he did not have a computer himself, he made CD copies of multiple Linux distributions
and gave them to me.
And this happened more than once.
At this time I was on Mac OS on Mac Mini.
But I also had a cheap laptop with Windows 10 for a few programs.
That laptop was too cheap with too little memory and soon, despite it was not old, it
could not manage to keep Windows updated.
It had too little memory even with additional software.
It had 32 GB hard drive and a 2 GB RAM.
So, this was my drive to install Linux for real.
I installed Linux Mint, XFCE, and the laptop was now usable again with an updated operating system.
My interest in Linux Mint led me to start listening to the Mint cost pod some years ago.
One of the hosts of Mint cost was also an HPR correspondent and in his presentation
of himself at every pod episode, he told he gave shows at HPR as well and shared his ID
number.
And every Mint cost pod episode also had a nolexments where Mint cost thanked HPR for letting them
use the HPR mumble server.
And at the end of each year, Mint cost has also sent the jingle for the HPR new year show
where everyone is welcome to live chat or just listening.
And I know I tune in and listen to the new year show.
Eventually, I have also listened to one or another show in earlier years.
However, when Mint cost this year, 2024, talked about Hacker Public Radio, they have mentioned
it was lower episodes and encouraged Mint cost less listeners to contribute.
And it was after this, I finally became a regular listener to the Hacker Public Radio and
at the same time recorded my first show.
I like HPR for its community-based host approach.
I like that shows mostly are given under the creative common attribution share like international
license.
I like the concept of knowledge and experience sharing.
I like that the content is what matters most, the equipment and presentation skills are
of less importance.
I like the monthly community shows with feedback and review of shows and comments.
I like the occasional comments to my shows and my possibility to comment on other shows
on the website.
That is how my journey with Hacker Public Radio started.
Thank you for listening, take care and goodbye.
