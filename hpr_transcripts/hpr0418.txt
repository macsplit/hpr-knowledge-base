All right, thank you, Jason Scott.
First off, let me like go ahead and mention the schedule for Compton 9.
I'll be presenting my talk on 7-1-1 numbers next, followed by Dom Fowler,
speech on Project MS, then Royal, doing his number on Diling for Docs.
The Robert will be presenting on UISN numbers.
Doc figure will be presenting a mix and mash of some cool finds like his living goods 2.0.
And hopefully, if you're talking and that can make it, we'll be calling, he'll be doing DSP and X25 Networks.
So, first off, my 7-1-1 numbers talk was presented by me and Storm,
and Storm unfortunately couldn't make it at this time.
So, although we're not really sure when the first 7-1-1 numbers showed up,
it's kind of been freaking anomaly over the years.
They're spotted in the letters section of the 1997 Spring Issue of the Twins' Hunter magazine,
and have appeared on many popular freaking forums since then, like Jim Rev in 2005.
After Storm found a couple of these 7-1-1 numbers during some of strange scanning,
we figured out this would be like a perfect topic to cover for Compton 9.
For those of you that don't know what the 7-1-1 numbers are,
it's not the technical name for these numbers.
It's just what they've come to be known by in the scene.
These numbers are just usually toll free numbers that you call and will read off.
Sometimes read off 1,000, followed by 100, followed by 2 digits, then 7-1-1, and then 7 digits.
100 and the 2 digit number all seem to be random.
And the 7 digit number is always the same for that individual 7-1-1 number.
The reason that these numbers are called 7-1 numbers is because the only common thing between all of them
is that it reads off 7-1-1.
Let's go ahead and call a couple.
Ryge 5, can you get those 3-8 in?
Ryge 5?
Oh dear.
All right, looks like we're having some three-way issues.
All right, that's a weather.
We'll give this a call line.
Actually, let me try something.
Tell me how the volume is on this.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Okay, so you're just giving me a number and I'll call it for you if you'd like.
Yeah, one second.
Try 800-504-504-1337.
All righty, one moment.
9-100-4-7-1-1-4-1-1-1-3-5-2-4.
Okay, so you probably can hear those, but those are touched on so the little things are getting notched out.
Yeah, Ryge 5, can you go ahead and 3-8 in the 6-4-9-1997-1?
Yeah, he's in a three-way there then.
Sorry for the technical difficulties.
Quite technical.
You just go ahead and do that.
All right, so what's the number again?
6-4-800-649-9097.
All righty.
And by the way, we'll have all these numbers in a text file on the site so that if any of you guys want to call some of them yourself, you can do that in the future.
898-7-1-1-3-2-3-5-2-1-2.
Yeah, the DCMS is getting muted by us, I think.
Yeah, it's like the only thing that's a three-way sorry.
Yeah, since you couldn't hear that really well, it's followed by what seems like seven-ray random DCMS tones.
Unfortunately, we couldn't decode the DCMS, so we're not really sure what it's dialing, but we're sure it's probably something interesting.
Okay, so the first thing I did after finding some of these was we called up a Resport, which stands for Responsible Organization.
If you'd like to call that, the number is 800-337-4194.
And Responsible Organization is basically the company that is handling a toll-free number.
They control it, they help direct it, they basically run that through the 800 number.
And so every single one of the 7-1-1 numbers we found was all, the Resport was all AT&T, every single one.
We called up a tech number that five figures dropped on us for AT&T, which is 800-325-555.
And so we did a little social engineering and figured out that West Interactive owns these numbers,
which gray area pointed out on the thread and been rough actually a couple years ago.
So the next logical step was to call West Interactive and figure out what they could do.
So we called them up and got thrown around a bit on their shitty PVX until we finally reached the Supervisor.
And they decided to finally, I gave them the 7-1-1 number and they looked it up in their database and realized that they did, in fact, own the number, but they had no idea what it was for.
So they asked if they could have a tech guy calling back and I said, you know, that was fine.
So in about 20 minutes, 23 minutes, I had a tech guy calling back and explained to me that 7-1-1 numbers are actually used to help test IVRs, which stands for Interactive Voice Response Systems.
These are systems that when you call them up, they either ask for a certain tone, like, you know, press 1 to go to this menu or press 7 to go to this.
Or sometimes they'll be voice response systems where you just say a number and then I'll do that.
So basically the numbers that are getting read off are helping to test the IVR to make sure it's reading both voice detection and DTMF tones properly.
So that's about it. We've got a complete list of all the 7-1-1 numbers. Everyone that we could find is then there.
And we have the restboard and the numbers to call. And we also have results from calling it three times and posting results.
So do we have any questions or anything about the 7-1-1 numbers?
So if we could do 7, actually, I kind of was like a theory that I've had going on for a little while. If you like the first digits, they're almost always 900 or 1000 or something.
Like, one time I got 2000, but I think what those are is it's like a trunk idea or something. Or after 7-1-1, I think the digits, after that they're always the same for whatever number you're calling.
So I might be like a unique identifier for the IVR or whatever the hell it is because they're probably like a huge cluster of them, like in a server room somewhere.
Well, the two digit numbers, they do change with basically every call. We've got results from calling them multiple times. And the 800, 504, 1337 number that I gave out, for example, let me find it real quick.
Okay, so we called it one time and we had 4-3 as the two digit number. And the next time we called it was 3-2. And then the next time was 1-0.
So the only thing that stays consistent with each one is the 7 digits that get read off at the very end. And 7-1-1. The 7 digits for the 504, 1-3-7-1, for example, are 4-1-1-3-5-2-4.
Okay, and also we've managed to find the first, what I think is the first 8-1-1 number. Stop for your eye and do that. It's key to your eye that didn't real quick. Stop for your...
Sure. It's 800, 7-8-9, 6-3-2-4.
All right. And this is the first ever 8-1-1.
9-160-8-1-1-3-2-6-7-3-4-7.
No TTMF.
Yeah, so as you can see, it's a little different. But yeah, that's about it. Do you have any more questions or comments or whatever on the 7-1-1 numbers?
Nope. All right. Then next up, we should have Don for all and presenting on project them up.
