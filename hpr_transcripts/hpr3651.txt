This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3651 from Monday 1 August 2022.
Today's show is entitled HPR Community News for July 2022.
It is part of the series HPR Community News.
It is hosted by HPR volunteers and is about 49 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is HPR volunteers talk about shows released and comments posted in July 2022.
Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public
Radio.
This is the Community News for July 2022 joining me this evening is as ever.
Hello Dave Morris here.
It's just the two of us we switched from Saturday to Sunday today.
Thank you very much Dave because I've quite a bit going on here at the moment.
HPR Community News is a show that we do every month.
We've been the two janitors and everybody else is more than welcome to join and we basically
go through all the shows that have been on in the last month.
You host chat about anything else that's been on the main list that you've if you have
missed it or anything else that's come up.
So as tradition dictates can you introduce the new hosts to them?
They're a broom of office.
Yes indeed we have two excellent content oh it's wonderful.
We have been RC and we have Celeste so we'll be coming along to their shows.
As we go through the month shows.
Okay so the first show that we had was Ahuga Travel Series opened to anybody who wants
to do it but these are some very good chills.
Start on off for the basics planning an RV trip.
Yeah fascinating it's not a thing that people do quite the same level in UK as far as
I'm aware so it's interesting to hear about.
Yeah it's my brother did a thing where if you drove in an RV himself in the mate was
with the US forces in around where he lives and they wanted to do the RV trip so they did
an RV trip right across the US and when they got to the to from to the west coast there
was that volcano thing?
So they got an extra two weeks courtesy of actually having it.
Oh wow and there was also not earlier the British Airways paid their additional costs so
they had the full extra two weeks so they went from up to Seattle the whole way down to
L.A. so that it crossed country and north so very good.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that must be great and something like this.
This means to a hookah stuff I think it's great to get insights into the stuff that goes
on.
Fantastic.
So is he not wanting to waffle on the boat for hours on the show but okay.
Brighten the Hollywood comments, enjoy the show, I enjoy the show, I hope you put some
pictures of your camper in future episodes.
Also I wonder if you might try some open source tools in future trips side by side to see
how they compare Google's offer rings.
The Kevin O'Brien says photos I'm glad you enjoyed it Brian.
First you have to answer about my planning process and there are no photos involved other
than screenshots on the accompanying webpage which is always linked in the show notes and
yes I can vouch for that.
In later episodes when I talk about the trip itself the accompanying webpage also have
links to photos on my Flickr account so if I have not encountered any open source apps
for the trip planning maybe out there I just haven't found them yet.
Excellent.
The next show was Community News, no comments moving on to the next show.
Programming 101 there was one comment by by the way this was a beginner's introduction
to web scraping in Python by class 2 and some guy on the internet says thank you.
I want to learn how to web scrape because I've government regulation I need is posted
online but if you want an offline copy they force you to purchase a physical book from
a third party rather than purchase a digital copy in EPUB or PDF.
The regulation changes often and you have to purchase the entire book rather than just
the changes.
I'm going to brick up high a few times to learn web scraping then you can read my
own digital copy thanks again and if anyone can do that I'm sure it's some guy in the
internet.
Yeah yeah yeah he has great determination there's this guy on the internet so yeah I'll
be fascinated how he gets on.
The next one is Collective History of Raid Controller Brands and this is like a mini series
that's GWP who I think works and that's sector has done.
I'm finding this interesting because there was a time I used to read all the you know
bike magazine and whatever and now I don't care as much.
Same here yes yes.
It's good to have an insight isn't it yeah yeah absolutely.
It was entitled Raid but I didn't hear much about Raid or at least my notes says where
was the Raid stuff but still the Ram and Rom stuff he was talking about was very interesting
yeah if I did not know at all so I'm not happy.
Bringing to a bringing to an end I think they series on PECs plumbing this is one I've
been able to share and work as well.
Very good.
There's one comment from DNT who says a Hacker's plumbing system this is a great series thanks
for putting it together this episode in particular I think would be a reference of the years
with all the tips not to ruin your own day.
Very very good.
Yeah yeah yeah absolutely.
I know he was a little bit nervous about putting forward such a series in the first
stages but boy it was this is a good one yeah very popular and it's also one that I have
whenever I do get time one of my one of the list things to do is add some horse pipe to
the garden and I'm going to need to join into the PECs that they've run over so there
you go I should be using this no it's good this is exactly is it of interest hackers
absolutely yes I would say so yeah yeah yeah yeah not in the traditional computer programming
sense but just in that the work dealing with the world as a hacker is a fascinating subject
yeah yeah anything on that subject would be great yeah and I mean we use the word hacker
over here and hacker public radio but you know you can also use the word maker so we're
on that end of the spectrum is this a maker thing to do absolutely you really come back
with a little tool on the 365 system monitoring center it's one of these like dashboardy type
things for having a look at your system and I installed it at the time just to think yeah
I'll have a look but since then I've been using Guru parallel for a lot of things and I wanted
to see what my system was going to be looking like and this has been an invaluable little speedometer
dashboard thing it's really really cool it takes a few seconds to install it and I've used
it about five times since since this episode in the future feed yeah I also installed it and had
a go at it but in my case I didn't find that it helped me well hasn't helped me yet in comparison
to H top and B top and those sorts of things but the day may welcome yeah it's it's nice for just
you don't want to be constantly tracking you just want to see okay I was running maxing up my
system running parallel and then yes I had the progress bar but it was just nice to see okay there
what's what's going on and stuff yeah I don't know yeah cool the stuff evil Steve doesn't want you
to know about this is season one episode seven and look and pry on very good little series here
yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no no that's a shame actually but I certainly found this really good
I quite like the the two-host type of model with the R Brady Frost joining in exactly yeah and
that was that was really good it was good before but it's just like to hear that so dialogues
going on yeah it does give that and just give a little bit of three-dimensionality I guess yeah
that's a good way of putting it yeah HBR feed to SQLite by Norse Wow this is awesome
this is awesome and you know what this is awesome it means that we need to enrich our feed Dave
with because I really would like to have it that everything is yeah is in the feed and if it's
you're not able to create HBR website from the full RSS feed then we've done something wrong
yes yes I think you might be have a few problems with some of the bits man you know the pictures
the pictures are in the feed yeah they are yeah yeah yeah yeah so you can put pictures and
feed and snow problem boss you can also link to them I mean yes yes yes yes we don't need to be
pedantic about it but no no things like the tags and stuff we should have that in the feed as well as
actually be there for sure yeah yeah we would need to extend as but I'm sure there's something in
the awesome specification that would allow us to do that yeah cool the tags are on the internet
archive by the way as well no but just in case other people didn't know and you can use them
for searching for shows quite nicely on there yeah you can do without JavaScript exactly and
even without even with JavaScript what's the point the tags themselves are for other sites to
index our stuff really yeah whereas the series and holes are to provide context for a navigation
for the website that's that is the difference between the two tags one doesn't replace the other
they're both doing two different jobs so can you comment it yes daily database dump in SQL
formats hacker public radio dot org forward slash hpr forward set dot SQL so hacker public radio dot
org forward slash hpr dot SQL run a cron job every day and pull that down and you've got the hpr
database without the comments about the reservations you're never going to get the reservations we will
publish the schema but there's no point you know it's got people's personal IP address in there
all sorts of crap so we don't want to do that and the comments we will do that later because it's
I'm looking for a PHP expert to audit the code that codes a lot newer and that's entirely mine so
any any problems I'm happy to own them but back to this episode this was awesome I really
I really like this and I would like Norris has another one coming up so let's reserve for the
comments until we get to that yep good good good well yeah great very enterprising on his
behalf it's it yeah it's an impressive thing to do so yeah fantastic yes least points being
handed out here left and right Dave following day I posted the show on
um on some phone issues I had I'd been using uh primitive ftpd and then it stopped all of a sudden
so I looked for an alternative and found a far better alternative in uh in the form of simple sshd
it's on eftroid perfect little two yeah it looks really cool I don't know why I want to hit the
moment because I know when I do because Android lies to you if you plug it in everything it does
is lying to you the only time it doesn't lie to you is when you're in a db android debugging bridges
route every other time it's lying to you this is the closest thing to not lying to you about the
file system that you can get and at the end so you can you can just mount your uh your phone as an
ssh ssh ft ssh ft ssh ft ssh fs sorry you can mount it as an ssh fs and you can just copy files over
or sync files over and you don't have any of this crap that uh oh it's got some on the sd card
and some on the internal one but they're all simulating to the change and write blah blah blah so
yeah yeah just kidding I do transfer stuff I use uh kde connect for doing it but but that's all I
really want to do I just want to pull photos off it and uh and that type of thing um and you know
you can set that up so it always drops in the same place on the target machine and all that sort
of thing but yes I do take your point that that that's that's that's still at that level of uh
you know you can't look under here no no don't leave that corner of the carpet no
and stuff like that it um yeah yeah well the reason I I use this often is that I have my phone
on the Wi-Fi network and then uh I um myself on the wired network and the Wi-Fi network can I get
to the wired network so all right all right okay kde connect doesn't work for me
I never thought to do that that would really mess up my family yeah to try yeah
Linux in laws the job interview with Chris Jenkins from Confluent and we have no comments about this
but this was about Kafka very very enjoyable show um yeah and I mean we use Kafka a work a lot
and I completely missed the overall helicopter view you know the configuration and all the rest
that but the whole helicopter view of it really helped the show really helped just to get an idea
where they're coming from what the difference is is how it differs from a regular database why
you would want to use a brilliant brilliant brilliant episode anyone thinking of using Kafka are
you know thinking of other databases this is he very clearly experienced here the reasons why you
would use a no-sequel or relation relational database etc that is all yeah I found it most
interesting too I almost tempted to rebuild my uh pie four b's at the moment and wondering whether
to put it on there because it effectively it's an event streaming tool isn't it um so you can
you can events can be triggered to it or a definition of events I'm not quite sure how you
do that but I've worked in other systems that do similar things but it can also send stuff out
as MQTT if you configure it that way so I'm wondering if that could be a useful component in an
IoT download setup and I look forward to hearing the show it's ever if I ever get to it yes certainly
on the list uh I also you can also slap a uh SQL front end to it as well
cool yeah much dig deep and that would sound very interesting and the next one expert
uh DIR usage by a hooker I have to I know you haven't used uh you're not coming from that branch
you're true unixie guy um speaking of which I'm listening to the new year show in a mirror you
talking about Vax systems and I've already added a few lines to my uh get Dave to do a show about
this but it's good we have a similar background just in the digression there um I was moving things
around in my attic and I found a big pile of uh uh Vax um well VMS manuals I think they date from
the alpha years rather than the VMS uh the the Vax uh the Vax years and uh so I'm not sure what they
are but uh I think I'm gonna bring them downstairs now good look at them because there might be
some some gems there because the way that uh VMS did things was weird and clunky in some respects
but really clever in others yeah a lot of the a lot of those people left digital and went to work for
Microsoft and made various windows versions based on what they knew from VMS so um there you go
cool the next day turn till turn table audio capture part two by archer seventy-two I
revised previous capture scripts and this my friends is the black bush of shows because this is
exactly what I am needing whenever all this other crap is done I still have an our whole box
of tips and stuff to be archived this shall help the show up language not correct syntax are
lying ten this will help yeah we know we know what you mean yes now it's good um
I just have to do do some just some amazing stuff I'm really impressed with
how he puts together this type of thing and he's got the pictures done to
oh yeah to an art form now I think so they're very good yes everything you need you can actually
just listen to that you know browse the pictures which I invariably forget to extract and then
why does this look so crap ah I haven't extracted all the pictures well okay there you go
I could but yes very very good um following day we had an interview with
by telly telly I think the you can telly yes yeah I think so another one of
operators uh I think uh operations cohorts back in the ethical hacking
um dense pentesting the likelihood yeah yeah pentesting that's what we're calling it yeah
yes I enjoyed this is good this was wow this was amazing I mentioned this to my son
suggested he have a have a we listen to it because he's not he's in the security into things but
he now works for a big big company that probably will I do pen testing from time to time
and he might find this quite uh an insight into into that world so yeah I found this subtly
fascinating um so yeah thank you very much operator for such a thing Kevin O'Brien says in the
comments great show I hope you guys do more shows together this is a lot of fun and thanks for
the shout out but did you record this a long time ago you mentioned shows I did back in 2019
2020 I think um operator says this is a lost interview I never upload it so I assume that means he
he found it is actually in some some corner or other so yeah it does look like it's an older one
but this is hit for your time has a different meaning here put it it didn't attract from his quality
absolutely no amazing amazing um we have been or see my computing history and the software I use
and we have lots of comments first archer 72 first shows the title that was a good first show
I'd like to hear more about C programming which I know nothing about also I think you will have
another friend here who likes BSD's audio is just fine keep it up to smite face and I'll do uh
oh Norrist oh plan nine plan nine they say some interesting future shows hopefully you will do
a show on your experience about plan nine I'd forgotten I'd come into it on this one um I said
as well yeah I realized that as you were as I was just about to start the you know the
the nearest one um I said an excellent first show I enjoyed this a lot it sounded really good and
had a lot of interesting content I'd like to hear more about modern BSD I used to use a proprietary
Unix is back based on BSD back in the day for example Sunos on Suns not much deck altrix on deck
MIPS systems deck station deck server daily for several years and OSF1 AXP and later true 64 Unix
on deck health is a little so when I move to Linux at work and at home so I'm out of touch with
the way BSD has developed and Ryan and Ohio said future show I bought for plan nine do you know what
I love is that the community is now doing my job for me you know listen to the shows and then
go hey I want to know the show well like this excellent feel free to do this people yeah yeah well
absolutely and it's also good feedback for the for the host that you know people are listening
people are interested people want more so what could be better all around Alex it gets over this
oh people won't be interested in a show about blah you know and I think the the the game is
up Dave as far as we're concerned people know that we'll just say yes we'd love to show about
blah these these are real requests not these are real requests that are just kidding Dave requests
that's the way now another new host came in Celeste I believe pinball machine repairs and there
was a guy in work whose contractor who's temporarily not working anymore has huge hobby of
repairing pinball machines so I was very interested in the show
as I'm sure 72 says is a mine or yours I think it's actually mine because you did
yeah that's one correct go go go go not just 72 says pinball machines and English that was interesting
I remember working at a place that assembled the lighting backpaints for these machines I would
get to play on the machines at lunch two of the memorable ones were Star Wars the Adam families
and last action heroes or when your English is just fine you might find Dave Morris's series
on the English idiosyncrasies a good listen starting with he refers to show two double five
eight badly with English part one so thank you very much sir 72 for the citation and I would say
don't of course you don't have an all you don't want to go down your English is wide
yeah yeah no no I don't think it's a English is a weird language and it's one of the things I'm
trying to convey you know but it's got some very strange things in it which which are quite
hard if you're not learning it as a child you know absolutely trace as welcome this pinball repair
project sounds like so much fun thank you for sharing your experiences and I'm looking forward
to your next podcast you have to do a new podcast now and also please don't worry about the
pronunciation of English word it was easy to understand everything you said I listened at 1.5
speed welcome that's great yeah Brian and Ohio says sound scape you could do a show recording
the sound playing the pinball machine eliminates the no time to do a show problem I assume we have
time to play smiley face and I support that that's a brilliant idea thanks Brian yeah that would
be fun wouldn't it yeah I would enjoy listening to that and you rune come in with a how to set
up a Linux word RF VPN basically reading his own blood published at the same time no problems with
that yeah absolutely I it sailed over my head a teeny bit and then I saw the blog reference and
opened it up wow I haven't got had enough time to read it but it's really good quality stuff
so yeah definitely recommend everybody goes and reads that worry guard is something I set up once
about every 18 months or so and you know just enough time to know that I've done this in the past
but also just enough time to have completely forgotten how I did this in the past or the software
so he did so much that it's changed oh yeah now Brian and Ohio oh is kind of a little jealous person
now I so wanted one of those oh arm slackwear fourth oh my description of a laptop and the laptop
in question is the pie top I really wanted one of them just having a raspberry pie with a
slide out keyboard and a screen basically everything you want but they're a ridiculously expensive
yeah yeah I know I remember seeing them and thinking nah not for me but yeah really cool machine
I was impressed by the way Brian mastered the one of the shortcomings yeah about the battery
stuff needs he's built in an Arduino that monitors the battery level so yeah wow very very impressive
and it goes to show what you can do is such a thing that you can get inside the guts of it as well
yeah exactly but Brian can very well know that I know he messes with Arduino we can expect while
I already knew that from the fourth episode so yeah more shows them I'm hardware hacking please thanks
Brian no pressure and Ron has been doing some weekend projects I love this recycling
a lawn chair or a patio umbrella thing broke and he fixed it and it's cool yeah it's a nice solution
actually isn't it yeah I think I've used that that epoxy impregnated tape to mend a
leaky pipe at one point in the earth lapse I thought I lived in because that used to be a sort of
plumbing do dad it's a cloth soaked in epoxy I don't not quite sure how it what makes it
sent but anyway whatever but it's yeah what a great idea I'd have been heading down the same road
of putting a big dowel down there or getting a larger pipe to put around the outside or something
like that then it would have gone through the hole and he's he's found a great solution that
exactly just like scrunchies super useful yes indeed and a response to tomorrow's show god that
was a pain in the earth to do yeah it was about statistics on hpr and my view on how you
use us the air yeah yeah no I enjoyed listening to this it was it was really good it was yeah
career no it's it sort of needs more study than listening to the audio while you're washing up
or something but still well worth the dig into I think yeah people the show notes are there the
full text of the show notes and yeah it brings up a little bit of a question is hpr a podcast
hosting platform or are we a podcast and what I mean by that is where are we a youtube where you
upload to a particular channel and you build your presence and whatever and I've never thought
we were but but I've been here from the start so I also don't see why you would think where that but
we are more like they what's that what's that um radio program on the BBC where a moment of
reflection where a vicar or a or an imam or a priest or somebody comes on to say I'd be
prayer of the day thought for the day is that for the day it's we're more thought for the day
every day and you host comes on and gives their thought for the day be they whatever that's hpr
except tech so if father father Murphy comes on and does the show for it's not father Murphy show
it's for the Murphy on part for the day yes yes that well I think I've been here now for nearly
10 years and I'd like to listen before that and that was certainly the the model that I rigged
the into into what I was listening to you know that it is a means whereby people can
put up post it so as it were a virtual post it's or just generally think oh just look this
today I can tell other people about it and here we go rather than being a vehicle for
people to build their own presences on the internet not that's not how we would I mean we don't
not do that to randomly pulse I still haven't figured out the algorithm by which tattoo puts stuff
on hpr versus on glue world order if he's got show notes he puts them on hpr I suppose
maybe so maybe so anyway there are some comments about your first turn is you gonna do it
yeah I'll do the first one who's turn is it I'll do it long time later known unknowns this is
fascinating Ken and as you alluded to it's impossible to factor in people like me who to lead
some hpr episodes without listening to them anything by tattoo is an instant listen anything by
Linux in laws is an instant delete that's hard uh move back the beauty of hpr is the broad selection
and unpredictability I think the spread of hpr would be destroyed if it was worth become a podcast
jester speutian service for podcasters looking to exploit hpr's readymade audience okay
so we happen to comment from somebody whose handle is e hyphen slash hyphen why I'm sure this is not a
little I've missed it no yeah it could be a leads to z easy right my my eyes can't do lead
to a two old okay the fonts doesn't help for when you look at the model
nah yeah yeah yeah probably does work in in other fonts and it also depends on the browser probably
some isn't anyway the comment was only interviews only listen to the interviews not sure how Ken is
going to factor that into the calculations smiley face no I'm not doing any more freckin stats thank
you and this is uh yesterday show was in response to this show which was um Linux in laws uh 20 years of
review and they kind of had a spoof of um going back at going forward in time and then back in time
I was a bit annoyed that hpr stopped some five years Dave why would that be do you think
yeah yeah we do something about that must mean yes okay and the last show at the 29th is major
destinations building a plan around major destinations and using membership to get discounted stays
this this is a hookah's travel series obviously for the or everything but I was also listening
to this show thinking yeah I want to actually make use of um nice trains are being pushed
here in europe as well a series of how I basically would like to go with my daughter or whatever
around for a few city breaks on night trains you know arrive somewhere uh sleep during the night
arrive somewhere spend the day getting the train come back on that type of thing yeah yeah yeah
but are you that's it what else do you that was uh yeah I was just going to comment on a hookah's
show saying that yeah the I hadn't realized that he was towing and RV I assumed it was one of these
sort of long band I think because they were the ones I saw most of in Yosemite when I took my kids
there um but uh the is it knocking what was that I didn't think he was towing us
he is yeah he said so yeah yeah he's he's it's a towing he was saying uh when you're towing
yep you have to restrict yourself to 60 miles an hour or he did anyway and he's also talking about
going finding a low bridge and realizing it was a low bridge just as he approached it stopping and
then having to get out of that place um with uh uh if you're not skilled at uh reversing with a trailer
I certainly wouldn't be that's not what he said but I'm just guessing what what he's saying
um so and also his his RV is uh 13 feet tall we got that isn't meters so it's a massive
people so yeah I wonder what it's like you know okay you know we've fought us once
of a Zorvi setup I'm sorry absolutely absolutely I'd love to know what it's like in a in a heavy
crosswind um you know yeah exactly come around the edge of a edge of a hill or something
no mountain cliff and it moves you across from this is yeah kind of so yeah yeah yeah so I'm
fascinated to to know more about this it's anyway very interesting series yep okay cool comments
on other shows uh there's one comment on by DNT on uh using task warrior to structureize your
work which was a yirune button show from 2020 DNT said I saw your most recent episode
under reminded me of this one I had heard of task warrior many times in this show you explained
how you can set weights for different distributes out of which the urgency score can is calculated
by that you can sort your mess of things you wish you would do that proved too irresistible
irresistible to my little brain I it really is the one thing that sets it apart having succumbed
via vendor lucky network to a less free and more convenient option I am not using task warrior
anymore but I did for a good while and I think it is the most impressive to do list application
out there so thanks for the show huh that's a really good comment I used to use task warrior work
for a while then I stopped when I retired and listening to your in's show I did
plunge back into task warrior but then I found a week had gone by and I'd forgotten it I'd actually
forgot to go and so I don't know what that says about me but yeah I don't think it is really
thing that sticks with me but I can see that somebody has different different mindset different
approach could could get a lot of it so that's really cool good comment so we have a comment from
operator to operator who says installer changed because you can't install only key with a local
admin not even set compact layer equals runners invoker works and he gives a link to a to one of his
yes scripts to presume you get random so I've not actually looked to be honest yeah cool how we
going to tackle the website thing okay well I'll do the first one and this is in response to
a comment in any case I would like this about source code for the HPR website in any case the
quote is any case I would like to be in the loop some sort of website working group could be
great to have discussions without filling up the mail list good point will move the discussions
after the community uses a wider community can have their say I just started and then this is
rolls point I just started the HPR site generator project which is currently hosted on Git Lab
and points to a link I propose to move the general discussion about the HPR website project code
to the projects issue tracker from an official location is set up if this is acceptable please
create an issue with the label general discussion blah blah blah I refer to some form of
for a mailing list of discussions but I would like I don't wish to get too much work for the
janitors of anonymous hosts okay you do Chris's response Chris's yeah Chris says I second the above
motion you do runs reply please I'm lazy and track yeah I'm sorry it's okay I'll do it anyone
else interested I would be interested in helping develop an upload API I have
contemplated an HPR recording app that would help record edit and post the show from
reform or tablet also have ideas from a command line script which reads a file that has various
upload fields in it and then post to the website from the GNUX install from my GNUX install
adventures I was looking to become more familiar with scheme and possibly guile so starting
working on a script to upload the show don't have anything worked yet I will now create a scm file
with various fields definitions and writing my show notes then I just copy and paste them into
the browser input fields not that a script program couldn't make the post calls to some location
that the same location that the web form does but it's easier to parse the response particularly
or responses have you got your runes yeah sorry my yeah I seem to have gone round in a loop
but yes I have yes just my small two cents in this discussion maybe Elm is a nice solution
and he refers to a Twitter tweet okay cool and Chris replies hi Ron thanks for the
seconding this I've such a script based on Python framework called Selidium which is an
integral part of the in those publishing workflow around HPR the trouble is that is the
obtain the pain to maintain as for example is changed to the upload page structure content has
the potential to easily break the script a couple of Europe's back I came with a high level design
of such an API I publish this on the HPR GitLab instance see my previous remarks but apparently
this document is finished in the midst of time I haven't heard back from Ken and Dave on my
previous email I'm sure I'll see if I can dig this out and share with you in a more public place
and we can take it from there so you said you you want to do next yeah I read okay the HPR
website has been updated to support emails with no spam dot no spam so we can release the database
easier this is involved a lot of changes to a lot of the web pages so it seems if
while it all seems fine can you report any issues thanks and that's related to the publishing
of the SQL database which we wanted to do we didn't want to release the emails for storage
as regular emails and now we're stored them instead of job blog at example.com we're storing
them physically we used to read job blog at example.com and then when we published on the website we
published it as job blog dot no spam at no spam dot example.com and now we just save it in the
database as job blog dot no spam at no spam dot example.com and then when we use it we strip out
the things so that way it's say it by default safer okay unfortunately you are next
responding exactly it's also from you and it seems to have gone okay the get yours page now has
a link to the database dump in SQL so the link is hackupublicradio.org forms.hpr.sql I'll start
working on the template from Rome's HPR generator next to get the site produced first focusing
on the static pages not linked to the database however don't let that stop you have a look at
the database and see how you can produce your own mirror site with the tools of your choice
and I go on to say we've held back the commons and reservations table from the database exports
for now expect the commons to be updated shortly I'm looking for some trusted experts
to audit the PHP code behind the commons system recommendations are welcome the reservations table
and schema will be made public with the reservations with the reservation system although I doubt that
the data will ever be published publishing it has no value as the entries are removed once the
sure is posted and it contains the horse's IP address so on a Chromic says high-can
stroke janitors any chance to get the old GitLab instance up once again I suppose if you want
to go down the route Linux in laws series one episode 51 a Git like structure may come in handy
and I pointed that to Josh who said the GitLab server has gone for over a year note the server
is long gone and pointed to replacement however Chris then says for those interested in processing
the possible API as part of the HPR website you'll find somewhat old proposal and taken to
account the GitT instance feedback implementations of the current proposals are welcome
in the interest of getting the actual size of the community for this I'll be interested to see if
the horse reading this actually use some sort of automation workflow for publishing the content HPR
and perhaps might show an interest in such an API project so yeah boiling things down I guess
the real question that we need to have answered is if there were if there were to be an API
who would use it because you've got to you've got to write code to use it you know it's not just
a case of walking up to a form and fill in in fields which as we heard Rowan does by offering up
a window and cutting and pasting one to another which is you know which is what I do as well
and you know it's a pretty convenient way of doing things so who would use an API if there was one
that would be the the question to ask do you think Ken yeah that's a good question I mean I
I design APIs for a living actually well the designing of APIs is the easy part it's
the whole system behind that that becomes more complex so I'm not against having an API we
could have a swagger file but yeah is anyone going to use it I really like to know
okay and Dave rounding off the show some very very sad news do you want to read this for a shy
yeah um we I think we both became aware through Twitter and Macedon of the recent death of
Oliver normally known as Oli Clark who has has been quite an important person in the in
various tech community forums and so on um he certainly met spoke to him at old camp and
he's been involved in the bar camps quite a lot and also in the raspberry pie jams as well so
he um he was a you're great enthusiast uh to to teach all manner of stuff I think the
rose pie jams was a great vehicle for doing that and sadly he died in November last year um and it
was covid that got him um unfortunately his family didn't know how to get the message out to
the wider community so he didn't have passwords or anything to to do that so uh so
it's only it's only come to light his departed only come to light in the past few weeks so yeah
extremely sad wasn't it yeah very uh yeah so I was going to say I collected his Twitter
masters on Flickr website and stuff like that together just in case anybody wants to uh you know
go and uh remember him through through such a vehicle and uh if we have a call out for how we can
pass on our uh messages of condolence to his family um to me he was just the backbone of uh on camp
always there and anytime I asked for an infuse it was like you know you're busy with the sound board
and uh you know I owe you a short I think so I was shocked to discover that I hadn't an interview
with him but it's always because he was busy helping out and stuff um yeah he was the most deep
in in some some something rather to do with the with our camp for sure yeah yeah and even even
pictures of our camp tended to have but you know uh Dan Lynch Ali and some other random person
less panda was often there yeah very good less or yeah poppy yeah very sad news
I need to tell them about all the shows and archive.org fees to how we do it just uh just a just a
account of that's incrementing so I managed to get 145 shows processed um to the way that we
would like them to be since the last community news so it's by just by doing five a day
so yeah so very good we go okay um that's it Dave thanks for uh postponing the time I'll try
and process this now straight away and uh I'm shooting tomorrow folks for another exciting
