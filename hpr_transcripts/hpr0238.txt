This morning, I told a sky with an idea that I wanted to try, so I put on my clothes
I slipped on my ring and wandered to leave that side
But November came, the things they were still the same
And I realized I had a band
But I lifted my hands to the barren trees
And I waited for the shock to subside
Nobody knows how far I've gone
Nobody knows the lyrics to my song
And I was sitting under a beautiful tree
Just lyrics, Johnny Applesy to me
When I realized the falling of the things that I've done
I could go the word mistake
I couldn't see the results because I was in the sun
And I called wind and blew in from the lake
November went, born at the end
So I sit down, fall in love
And the truth, that is, begins to set me free
Just lyrics, Johnny Applesy to me
Just lyrics, Johnny Applesy to me
Just lyrics, Johnny Applesy to me
Just lyrics, Johnny Applesy to me
