You
Hooray
Ma novela
Ma novela
Hail
Ma novela
Ma novela
That's you
I'll be leaving the the bash shell scripting for newbies part four session before you
start it.
I'll go ahead and introduce some people so we have five people who have provided us
with nibbles, food, I think that's actually my worst boss, hooray for food.
Did you like to read that?
Yes, pretty good.
My name is Do you know how I'm now working?
And I'm a little IT guy who has to go back to the day when the upload was really small.
I was actually part of it and I got out of action.
I was looking out to our companies that are looking at higher sales talent.
So if you can't learn any higher managers, I don't know many.
I love to talk to them.
Two of our fooders, John T. Aries and Older, business intelligence developer from Milliken for a number of years.
And Penn Sanders who you can talk to talk, but he's a good reporter as well.
He's been with us for a couple of years.
But I've been a new guy.
I've only been a company throughout three months, so I haven't been doing well.
But I just wanted to talk about David Nallie.
He said, hey, if I need pizza, it makes me happy in the same way.
So I hope you guys enjoy it.
If you have anything, grab our business card on the table and please take any pizza home because I'm not going to go.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
So I guess I'll get started.
Of course I guess.
Where is it?
I don't know.
Okay.
That's all right.
I'm starting to start.
All right.
So, yeah.
I was looking at a lot of previous things, and I noticed that I hadn't finished my Friday.
I'm preparing for Nallie after third one.
It's going to be a half hour session.
I'm going to get advice.
I'm going to get just, I'm going to recap on for good.
That's stuff.
So here's the, here's the shell script that I called Friday 4.
Remember when we were talking about Friday and Bacon?
That was session 2.
And what we were doing was using shell scripts to Friday.
So, we got the, you know, Shabang bin bash.
That in case this whole file can be executed by the bash shell.
And so what I'm going to do now is introduce the source.
So you see normally here, I've got to pop up Friday.com in my direction.
And I'll do a listing on quick.
So I've got to Friday.com.
And it's a text file as well.
If you were in an executable file, I would in my bash script, I would just execute it this way, right?
So let me do that very quick.
And I will execute my Friday 4.
Okay, first of all, I need to mod it to give me execute permissions on that.
And now, I'll try that again, Friday 4.
All right, so you can see here, permissions 9, 4, Friday.com.
It also makes, right, permissions, Friday, execute permissions 9.
So I will mod plus x, run.com, and run it again.
All right, so you can actually do run Friday.com.
But you all know what there is.
So I need to execute that.
Okay, Friday.com.
And let me do that.
All right, so what we've got here is just a kind of a config file sort of format.
Because it's going to be executed by the shell, we can use the same sort of things that the shell uses.
So you've got the counts in for comment.
We've got variables here that I created and assigned to them.
And now here, there's a new thing here called function.
Now you're familiar.
I'm sure another programming language is with what a function is.
There's a Z1 meeting explanation of what a function is.
Do you?
Do you really?
Okay.
So a function is something that you can call later as though or comment in the shell script or in the shell itself.
So what I've got here is I wrote down the three different ways you can use this.
And you'll see different people use different formats to different shell scripts.
So you see right here, let's you know that this is a function.
They put the word function.
I'm going to show back it in the brace.
And then it ends with the brace.
So this is the function of the priority.
Okay.
Another way you might see it, which is my third way, is kind of a C-way.
You've got the just a function name with the brand brand.
And then the brace, brace.
And that in case this is a function.
Now some people like to have both of them.
So that's why I put this right here.
It's a bash to understand both ways.
And I think one was inherited from born and one was inherited from C-shell.
One does the other.
And I think it's reason that bash side they will allow both of these ways and heck will even allow the third way.
So that's the purpose.
So the priority name is now function.
And whenever I call for it, they could people do this right here.
Y'all remember?
Okay.
Y'all remember the American variables, right?
You weren't here, were you?
Okay.
So from the command line, whenever I give that command,
and then it's whatever arguments, it enumerates those.
The command itself is .0.
The first parameter is .1.2.
And the second parameter is .3.7.7.7.
And in the same way, whenever you call a function,
its parameters are .1, 2, 3, and so on, and so forth.
.0.
So if I were to execute this by setting .com,
now I have a function called fry bacon.
Fry a much more bacon.
Yeah, that's fine.
Okay.
So, well, it's an exact one.
All right.
So, pay no attention to the man behind the screen.
Let me show you this now.
What's that?
The input.
The input.
Right.
It tests something.
And then it knows what to do in a while,
based on the bin,
else, and L is like a little bit of a feature.
So, because this is the end of the block of stuff that you have done.
Okay.
Okay.
So, this is what, if this is true, then do this part.
And if it's not, drop out and go to the D part.
Okay.
Connect.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
So.
Man, all right.
So, whenever I run this program, try for.
Okay.
It says fry bacon.
I found it also.
Now, anyway, I get why that is.
The thing is that I can, I ran this program by itself.
And, and the big one doesn't really do anything.
So, it ran all this and just quit.
Shell, whenever you call a program,
launches a brand new shell and does that thing and then comes back.
All right.
So, if it creates a multiple environment, does it?
It gives you the output of what it does and then just returns to you.
Now, because I just ran it and there was no output,
it doesn't happen.
It's a thing I try to basically function fry bacon.
It doesn't know what that is because inside that little environment
is where I can find what fry bacon is.
So, when I came back, that environment was gone.
There's nothing that can stop what I need to do.
It is.
Give me a second here.
Yeah, forgive me, I don't know what type one or a keyboard.
All right.
Well, that didn't do me any good.
Oh, you can jump.
All right, is that what I want?
Yeah, that's not what I want.
All right.
All right, I'm going to use the S1.
I'm not supposed to use this whenever I'm given a presentation
that's being scripted because the DCL, these characters,
you know, color characters and such.
Yeah.
All right, so we'll catch fry for again.
All right, now.
So, I changed it from actually executing fry.com to source.
Now, so what the source does, source actually runs the file
but keeps in its own environment instead of launching a brand new
bound environment.
It puts it within the environment of that script.
Does that make sense?
Any questions?
All right.
So, let me run that again.
And...
Boom.
All right.
So, now I didn't say what is this fry-like thing because I don't know what it is.
It actually used the function that was in this file that I created.
It used the variables that I created in that file well.
It put them in their proper place, all right?
So, from here, show the config file again.
So, you see here, we've got, on the three variables, the function.
So, it's sourced it, puts it in the environment that's currently running.
And then, it is, uh, source this file has been a brand-private function.
Number one, substitute here for meat, which is defined here.
They can...
They can be sued.
It is put...
It method is put in for two.
Method is fry.
They can be method...
Fry.
They can be fry.
And then, the third is the adder, which is right here, holy.
Holy.
All right.
So, the output should be, basically, fry holy.
Right.
That makes sense.
But that's correct.
Now, where we will see this normally.
Oh, and let me mention to you about it.
I'm right now, the two different ways you'll see it.
Um, source, fry.com, and dot, fry.com.
They both mean sources.
It is two domains in the same program.
Or same...
Or command-to-head, or function-out.
So, we think...
So, that makes sense.
So, you can see some places that have source, fry.com,
and some people have the dot.
Dot, shorter, so-in, dash, golf, bot, inspection-out.
You just say...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, struct.
Right.
But, uh, it's also...
If you don't see it there, you know,
or self-documentation purposes.
And if it's not there, you know,
one C-shelded, one, and four-shelded,
and the other, the fashion-corporate puzzle.
So, yes.
If you wanted to save the output of the program,
like, if you have less approach,
you could go back and see what the output was.
How would you do that?
Like, if you made it run,
if you wanted to, like, fill all the numbers.
So, if I want to run this,
and you can cast the output,
I might type it,
or you can cast it to, uh,
out file.
Seek me out.
Nothing appear on the string, right?
But, um,
it can catenate,
out file,
and make me fly boldly.
This is it.
But, if you run it again,
it's destroyed that.
If I run the same thing,
if I run the same thing again,
it'll be able to override it with,
if they can make my fold,
and then you can throw around and pipe out.
But, um, probably,
just like, you were in L.S.
Right.
Yeah.
And I say pipe,
but I didn't mean pipe.
I mean, read, read, read, read.
So, it's kind of an arrow.
It puts it into this file.
Right?
Now, uh,
the first thing you should,
for one that way,
conversely,
you can,
in programs that take standard-and,
you can send it.
With the last thing character.
So, you can,
I can put it out file,
let's send,
pipe 4,
if it gets pipe 4,
understood, you know,
the input,
which it does.
Um, it would understand what to do with this,
as a filter.
Any questions on that?
No one can get to that gap,
but you see it now,
so, it's up there.
Is there a way to see the output?
And then, why,
the same thing?
See!
Why, yes, there is.
Let's say, for example,
I want to use a,
a standard function called,
t,
is that?
That's the point of it, right?
And what that does,
it shows me the output,
and then I can also
get out file.
Yeah, okay,
I'm just waiting for my hands there.
So, let me give it an hour.
Am I?
So, I did it to the output.
So, let me put, uh,
can I output file 3?
Yes,
the big thing is,
fry only.
And just so that,
yeah.
All right.
Now, is it what,
understand what's going on?
The t is a program
that, um, you know,
the pipe here,
so the output,
the standard output from,
fry 4 goes to the standard input of t,
right?
You remember from the,
from the last month,
everyone was here,
and I explained this, right?
Yeah, okay.
Um, so when t does,
it tees it, you know,
in this sort of thing, you know,
it makes, uh,
the standard output,
keep going,
and it also keeps,
part of it,
keeps the standard output
in a file that you give it.
All right.
That's what t does.
So, not only puts it to you,
it stands out,
it also puts it into a file for that file.
Does that make sense?
If I understand t,
now,
is that a cool program?
So, you could, uh, you know,
if you, if you pipe a bunch of stuff together,
and you tee each step,
you know,
output from, you know,
fry 3, you know,
output 4,
output 5, 5, 5, 5, you know,
sort of thing.
You could, you could find out where,
but, you know,
something messes up, you know.
All right.
So, that is,
what I did finish two months ago.
So, now,
I'm going to go in here
to,
Brian Shakespeare.
And,
ah,
still going to,
okay.
All right.
So, I didn't finish,
I didn't pick up from,
anyone having any questions
on what I was gonna start following?
Absolutely.
Any questions?
Yes, Kevin.
All right.
Then, let me be.
Yes.
real briefly, a fry, as you quote, you have the variable 1, 3, or in brackets.
And the reason you did it is because...
Yeah, if you remember from...
If you remember from last month and a month before that,
Kevin, who was my guest?
There are different ways of...
Whenever you were referenced or variable,
you can do it with Dulleson and his name
or if there's like several of them that have a similar name,
and you're not sure which one's going to use,
you can use braces around the actual name.
Which is why I did it here, because if I didn't do it here,
it would be looking for the variable 1,
which doesn't exist.
And so it would be a blank name,
or maybe we don't wish something like that.
I think they changed the reasoning to do the other way around.
But it would be the other way around.
What kind of background do you want the other way around?
Well, let's start.
Let me do an example.
I'm going to echo some people who consider using the curly braces
like that, as if that's best practice,
it shows credit, best practice, yes.
Because for the very reason,
it mentions that it forces you to visually spell two things.
One, it tells the shell exactly what you want.
And I do links about this,
or on this reader, what it's supposed to be doing.
So you see here that I did an echo this path,
an echo of race path,
and I put it the same thing,
because it's the same variable,
but now I do an echo of having,
here's a variable called path,
but if I echo path being,
I can do path,
pink.
Okay, make sense?
Yeah, and there's no space yourself,
and the cat made it that way.
Straighten it, yes, with that.
It's a reinforcing your shell,
the tree path,
as very the name,
and everything else,
is the strength of this text.
Now, I've seen the thing,
that it used to be the other way around,
where it was automatic,
and say, okay, that's a variable.
Maybe it's not, maybe it's not,
so maybe not.
Maybe it's just me,
probably just me.
Okay, so any other questions?
Kevin, you had something about quoting?
Right, you had quotes just to try.
Is there anybody ready to discuss that?
Good bye.
All right.
That's enthusiasm I'm looking for.
All right.
Sam yellows,
what's the real difference?
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellows,
Sam yellow,
Okay.
I've looked for quotes around this,
dealt with quotes aimed
to interpret what's inside.
Did I say that right?
Interpret what is inside of yourself.
Otherwise, all right, so you see the braces,
that's what we just discussed.
Here at Web, there's only one variable that's used,
got any of those letters,
so there's numbers on this one for I see.
And there's only one method.
It's just a show that you can have.
And I understand too,
I'm doing this in multiple different ways,
because you'll see all different ways.
It puts it in quotes,
and what this does is
a shell will interpret
what's inside of the quotation marks
and put it in that place.
All right.
In this case,
the method is just one word,
so it doesn't really,
do anything for me,
and putting it in quotes doesn't really do anything.
All right. Now, you see here,
I don't actually,
there is one thing it does,
although it may not make a difference to you.
And that source is
everything the value of that,
of that variable,
to be treated as a single argument,
which in some cases,
may not make a difference
by in some cases will,
because if it's,
it translates to
something with a space in the middle,
then,
it would get four,
instead of three,
because the shell is going to treat
the result as two words.
But because it's promoted,
it will always be treated
as one string
regardless of what's inside,
whether there are spaces
or tabs or anything else.
Does that make sense?
Now, what you'll see here is,
there are the decal and the spurs,
and then this and the spurs,
and then this and tab and this.
Now,
the shell will drop,
you know, it'll,
you don't care about spaces.
Spaces are just a delimiterated space.
And I say space,
I mean, white space.
So, tab, space,
new lines,
if it's a, if it's continued.
The shell will say,
okay, I'm going to call an echo command
with this parameter,
this parameter, and that parameter.
And so, what echo did
was it just,
since it got this,
it's the first parameter,
and it didn't get this.
You just put this in here,
and then put a space,
because,
I'm looking for the next parameter,
this,
all those spaces would be there,
because this then would be one arc,
like you said.
As it is now,
one, two, three arguments,
or if one, two, and three,
think I'm a dog.
Okay.
So, if I hadn't closed,
all these spaces would show up there.
All right.
There we go.
There we go.
All right.
Now, more on myself.
Okay.
Now,
picking up where I left off.
Oh, that's smart.
I've got this two,
fried three,
and fried four,
and frying shapes here is,
this little jilt trick here.
I had talked about,
if you remember last month,
the cut command.
So, cuts,
and what's cut,
do you remember from last month?
Who was here from last month?
You were here.
Who else?
You were here.
Well, I was here,
and I don't remember what it was.
In fact, I've got it right here.
How about I do it?
I'll cut the aggregate out.
Cut.
Unless you break it up.
Cut takes the output,
or the file,
and breaks it up,
however you want to.
By the fault,
the delimiter.
The delimiter is the space.
I'm not sure.
Anyway, so,
last month, we counted the NC password file,
which is a colon separated file.
And so, we decided that we wanted the delimiter
to be colon.
And I'm giving you the mnemonics
that I remembered by,
the dashed dean's delimiter.
So, cut dashed dean,
the delimiter is colon.
So, anytime it sees a colon in this standard end,
it's going to regard that as a new
field.
Thank you.
So, dashed is field.
So, I'm looking for field number seven,
which in this particular case is all the shellings.
So, the fault shell for each user.
Right?
So, what do you mean?
What do you mean?
Okay, so, you remember I did because,
but also you take different,
does it have to do
by the dashed dean,
the delimiter way,
which is the way that I use it mostly?
There's also the dashed dean,
column, or dashed dean,
character, however you want to think of,
column number.
And so, if I were to do the dashed,
see column number 20,
everything in column 20,
and then like dash 40.
So, if everything in column 20 to 40,
if it were, let's say if it were a,
how common separated file,
but if it were a,
what do you call picture?
Fixed record format file.
Thank you.
I'm glad you're here tonight.
Where each record
has a fixed length.
And so, you knew that column 20
was the start of the,
elephant ear column,
or something like that.
And it ends at a column 40.
And you could do a,
out of that, just see 20 dash 40.
And when I say dash,
I mean the minus sign,
and then it would output
those columns,
or those characters,
or those bytes.
So, this month,
we're going to talk about,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's, it's path,
pace, cut and paste, right?
pace.
So, what does pace do?
It takes,
scan it in,
it takes files,
and puts them,
puts a line one from one file,
takes all the line once,
puts them all in one line.
And then it gets to line two,
of the first file, second,
third, fourth file,
puts them all in the same line.
Third, blah, blah, blah,
until, you know, one runs out,
and then it's going to get,
with the rest of them,
that's where,
when you give a dash,
that means standard in.
Okay?
So, what I'm going to do here,
is,
go to nl,
nl,
the nl program is
to give,
to number the lines of the file,
that's how I remember.
Number lines of,
handler three dot one, correct?
So,
whenever I do a nl,
handler three dot one,
it gives me client.
Let me just do it without.
There's a station,
act three,
one.
Scene one, thank you, please.
Of, of Hamlet.
And that's just the file self.
Whenever I do it with nl,
it gets line numbers.
There are 35 lines in this file,
and it gave me,
you know, the line number,
and two spaces,
and then the line, right?
Now you see in my,
there,
that if you give it cats,
the dash in option,
it'll do the same thing.
Cat with the dash in is,
number the lines.
So, if you don't cat,
and you do a couple things with cat,
you want to give it a dash in,
and they'll put the line in.
All right, so, what I'm going to do,
is paste that,
and, or pipe it to paste.
So, the standard out here that we just got,
and then it's also going to take the standard in the,
where it's going to take the file,
and see password.
Right?
So, what should happen then is,
the first line of it's a password,
and the first line of,
Hamlet act three, you've seen one,
with its numbered lines,
and we put on line one.
Same with line two over here,
and the second line of this.
Right, does that make sense everybody?
So, if I execute this,
there it is.
There.
So, you see any of you, like, the last,
the last line of it's password is UCP user,
units, units,
the public system of the block,
it's a tab territory,
it put the new line,
that's an NL gave me,
outside the line number,
that NL gave me,
not the new line,
Hamlet three point.
Right, now there were more lines
and Hamlet.
So, it print after the tab territory,
the number line,
and then the rest of it.
Right, where it is,
that here is pretty good.
That is, um,
paste default,
the engine.
So, you can give paste
an option of what other kind of character you want,
exactly,
I had that written out for whatever it is,
was that?
That's the default.
Yeah, that's the default length delimiter.
So, let me just give you a,
let me just do the hit.
You remember the last one's head,
just giving the first 10 lines,
unless that's the other one.
So, the first line is at,
blah, blah, blah, blah,
tab, line one.
To be about to mean that,
is the question code, right?
Line two.
Line two,
whether it's just no word in the minds,
we just suffer.
Right?
Any questions, so far?
I'll go over explaining this.
Okay.
Okay, I figured it out.
I'll go over explaining something.
Because I tend to do that in general.
All right, so,
that was springboard.
Yeah.
What are we doing on something?
What are we doing on something?
Where's our guess?
Very good.
Do you want to do this or this?
Yeah.
Thank you all.
I'm going to show you something.
That's my time.
Okay, okay.
Everyone is a sketch in here,
and he is from Protect Point,
and Protect Point is the meaning of
the level of security
partner.
We utilize Protect Point,
and they have a 3-4 by 7 knob,
down in or off,
down in 4-0 for a,
and they have a great network of tools,
but they do it to mean the function.
As a measure,
and we utilize that,
and it's like,
I'm going to show you something.
I'm going to divide it,
and how they use it.
So,
get it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So,
a lot of these going,
is there any questions I want to discuss?
I'm going to show you something related.
Well, keep talking to me while I said that.

He just went backward.
I didn't get a reverse angle.
I didn't get a reverse.
I didn't get a reverse angle.
I didn't get a reverse angle.
I didn't get a reverse angle.
It's a warm, but I mean the lamp.
Yeah, it is.
I think it's probably the most possible one.
We're trying for me, but then Eric can get it working.
It's so good to hear, right?
You can get it if you want.
Yeah.
Any other questions?
Well, while he's looking at that, I guess.
Let us go back over sharing with you.
I'm just going to take care of solutions sales engineer.
I'm not the technical systems engineer that sits behind you.
You know, a system that monitors all the time.
I'm going to be able to myself and do that that I rely on.
Of course, I'm bringing those folks to the big day,
but I'm happy with the biology as much information as I can.
As Rebecca had mentioned, the protect point,
we focus on a management work security solution,
really around intelligence and both technology and the people
that sit behind you in the technology.
We have a corporate headquarters that pays out of 12,
and I'm going to explore that.
We have a secondary facility as well with a third facility
coming on the second year soon.
So we have a level of nine they will build in 1,000.
Probably we've never heard of protect point before.
That's because we're a solution service technology,
a number of security.
Within that may be different things, different people.
One could be firewall.
It would come as a line.
Another one is intrusion detection prevention.
Does anybody here know in,
that's why we're doing firewall.
Imagine it's a point.
What about intrusion detection prevention?
Good, good.
A lot of folks are led to believe that the firewall is efficient.
One of the show reviews is that it's not the case.
It's so much not the case that every time you go in line
in an environment,
you will find the client will let us meet with the solution.
Because now we've realized where I was not educated on
before I am now that I can do without it.
Before I get into it,
I want to talk about a little bit about the second one.
Before I get into it,
I want to talk a little bit about technology.
I have a question that the one who goes with firewall is,
if you remember, I'm kind of like the sales engineer.
It's a little bit technical.
What he's wanting to do is call me and say,
hey,
just leave it in the system at home,
and keep getting virus in the system.
Which is the line table of my bottle.
So what do you think?
So it was Windows.
I read the firewall that we installed for it.
I take it everybody.
It is an IT and some form of fashion,
is that correct?
Business type?
Whichever one is more technical type.
So you don't have to leave it in the system.
How's up is your job?
By the way,
I'm from Florida.
I was born and raised there.
So I think I'm in America.
Here in America.
You know, you pick your job stuff.
I know it is, aren't you?
These focuses for guys who are out there
who are later in an international airport,
installing some types.
You know,
maybe I'll get it.
Maybe.
Some of these pet owners.
You pick your job stuff.
These four guys.
Oh, they have the same dogs.
Bigger happens in bed love.
Can you kind of relate that to your jobs?
Okay.
Wow.
That's a good evening.
What's up?
Oh, I mean, getting in Florida.
It's not quite common.
Notice the green.
One of the temporarily conceived.
Two.
Two.
That was when I placed it.
There's one.
You know, what happened to one?
In, by the way,
or a soccer moment is driving.
No.
Driving here can notice.
Keep your head out.
Just breathe.
Oh, that's what happens to.
The very same thing to the one.
This poor guy.
You know, you pick your job stuff.
Trust me.
There's other people out there that have work in it.
Okay.
I know how it works.
Hold the sign for you to breathe my sign.
Okay.
We're about to fly and see.
Okay.
We'll do that to fly and see the machines.
So kind of healing the house of ours.
Okay.
Moving on.
And by the way,
you might seem to just get the slider to hearing.
You know, I'll try to keep it moving.
Some information in your share.
I know that it's a high level.
And I'll give this to me.
But I just believe you're going to want to know.
You're going to want to see.
Typically, business are dealing with a finite number of resources.
I'm dealing with time and time in the day.
Too many projects.
Too many fires.
I don't know if I'm going to borrow these constants and shifting.
We're going to also be cautioning about the threat and landscape.
And what is really a breach?
Does it really mean you've been to a company?
If information was lost.
If data is hacked.
And the cost associated with that.
How do you approach that?
Typically.
Is it later?
Is it later security?
Or do we just throw a fireball out there?
And again, when we see a time and time again.
The confidence there.
The alpha level with a fireball.
And we'll talk more about that.
We'll talk about that point very soon.
In dealing with a finite number of resources.
We're talking really about money.
Time.
And the people resources.
So do we have enough time?
Do we have enough money?
Do we have the budget?
And do we have the resources?
Does everybody feel that they have a great large budget?
And they have plenty of resources.
And they get all the projects done on time.
I don't think they're using any gas every day.
It's smoking years.
And the belief is, it won't happen to me.
I'm OK.
I've got fireball on the points.
I'm going to get, by the way, I'm not going to fireball on.
I'm going to talk about work this.
One is it relates to a player's security.
And what I'll get into here is automated systems.
The threat.
The vulnerability.
It's the threat and the landscape.
And how often are systems that have to go attack?
Does anybody have an idea of someone who has a web server here?
You don't know how often you're attacked.
And how does it basically shut the box?
You don't.
Because there is a blogging that this is insane.
The answer was up there.
It has to do so.
Yeah.
But it's going on several times a second.
Yeah.
I put it either go on several times a week.
And I'm facing it here.
I put a link.
This is a WRP 400.
The wireless with the IDS and lines.
And I put it on with the 5 minutes.
I have 8 minutes.
It's my computer system at home.
I want to talk.
I'm going to get you on the cable.
Why are they attacking me?
I'm talking about that.
Anybody aware of the equipment project?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Good.
Going to my point and segue here.
You know, they put it out in the 15 seconds to do the web server out.
They would think 15 seconds.
The worm actually hit it in 60 seconds.
It was compromised for 15 minutes.
No challenge.
I was going to see how quickly someone did really knock someone.
It's something amazing.
Right?
A lot of it.
Hacking the system.
And I don't want to get it.
I don't want to waste until a firewall.
It wouldn't be able to store worm.
I mean, basically distributed here.
Based on the control.
Everyone's hurt here.
I'm sure the real one is just here.
But I'm sure you've heard of it.
Probably more of a quorum.
Anybody have any signatures?
Anybody have any buyers signatures?
You want to kind of pay the picture here.
It is the threats.
The threats that continue to come in every second.
Every minute.
Thousands of times.
Hundreds of thousands of times a day.
And don't take my word up for it.
I'm going to actually put it in here.
I'm going to log in to our operating unit operations center.
And I'm going to show you how they're left.
So it's very common in the industry.
And just when you think things are starting to settle down,
the attacks are going to start going away.
Well, the law continues.
Folks out there are becoming bolder.
Organize more things.
Technology, technology, technological advances.
Automating the attacks.
They are coming through mass webtax.
500,000 pages affected.
We'll read all this to you.
I'll just name point out these names here.
ZDNA, US and we're at USA Today wall bar.
TGMAX.
And even this slide in here of TGMAX.
We'll talk about that.
The firewall.
What does the firewall do?
It sits out there as a means to keep out unwanted instances.
I say that instances because anytime something attaches itself
into an instance is trying to catch itself from a port aid,
which is all stated.
It's by the way, if you've got port aid, you may have port aid,
but you know, we all have port aid.
So if you've got port aid, you can then browse the web.
That is a door.
We like to think that our firewall is always protected.
We guard that door.
How many ports are there?
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Six miles.
Again, the point being is just not firewalls,
but the main virus is not enough.
Intrusion detection.
Intrusion detection.
Let's get into some of this.
So just getting into some of your data.
I mean, if you want me to sound for you,
just let me know.
This is what he's really talking about.
He's going to be driving.
The botnet's getting harder to get on.
Everyone is making the botnet?
Okay.
Explain it just in case.
You know, with the botnet.
Just like, because I don't, actually.
Yeah, it's not even, well, I know it.
R-I-R-C.
Internet, relay chat.
It's a day.
It was a means to where the hackers really,
first started getting the strong football and being able to take you over
chat rooms, sharing credit card information, capturing credit card
information, selling sources during numbers, private confidential information,
police violence, and even more technical in terms of being able to replicate
themselves and in fact multiple thousands of computer systems, I believe
was a code where there was one of the big ones out there that kept infecting all
computer systems out there. Anybody else had anything to add on to the talk then?
So it's just a hell out there that's being able to get rid of it. You get systems that are
infected with virus and virus things over but yet the hackers will have a
command system that can instruct always infecting computers all what they want to
do. That's how they can distribute an I will service or any kind of thing. So now the
virus and you know, Joe Lowe's computer, they will go and attack some other
website and try to infect it or take over inject the virus into another computer
and make it part of that hole. And they are our consortiums that will sell the
service, sending spam from their lock in the right or whatever else you want them.
So now they're using your machine to spread the spam. Using your CPUs, I was using
your resource to see like your information. Yeah, most of the people that don't
have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer
like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't
have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer
like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer
like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine, they don't have a computer like machine,
So, when you're looking at layers security, well, does that mean that you have a firewall in place,
you shouldn't mean that you have a firewall in place, any virus in place, the spam built in place,
and the nitrogen protection prevention in place, when you're doing the improvement in the nitrogen protection prevention in yourself,
which I'll talk about some advantages, some disadvantages, advantages, the only advantage,
I'll talk about disadvantages, the only advantage, the only advantage, the only advantage, the only advantage, the only advantage, I'll talk about disadvantages and disadvantages,
I'm looking for information to come back to, you know, the findings of today, the stories that are just unbelievable.
and we all went to our partner and then soon to go in line with the solution.
What we were finding out that they have been reached with the SQL injection.
I mean, we're all of a sudden now, all that data is now going out now.
So, when they thought the firewall was in place, which was,
the encapsulate or encrypted packet and slip through the firewall
is now penetrated with the SQL injection packet.
And it's now screwing the information to the compound.
So, I've got a website that I can share with anybody who's interested.
You might know about the top of your head.
It's recently not marked by it.
But it's actually public record information showing these companies
where they have data losses.
Where they've had to publicly report and yes,
not just on there, along with a lot of other companies.
Anybody here that's the IC?
No.
That's not correct.
You know, they're all the lists.
There's a university that, the name of the Discontinental Line,
they just had to report data breach.
You want to see data breach.
They're talking social determinants.
We're talking your student record file information.
We're talking better with this.
The rest of the reason why I started to hit all these various splines
is to come on and put it in place.
Because the problem is not higher as a community being isolated.
I'm going to be best.
Can anyone in here have a title?
There's also a security number on the Internet.
My here is the fuel supply.
Now, we look down the bottom right-hand corner.
We look at that key symbol and lock symbol,
saying that it's secure.
Does that really need a secure?
Exactly.
It just means the transmission, the point A to point B.
What's happening on the outside?
It's in the database.
Who owns that database?
Are they protected?
They haven't bought all?
So what have they had to buy all?
How are they protecting that information?
So as a consumer, I think about that every time I enter my credit card number,
it's how you pick how it's the kind of number that's running.
I don't know if you've heard anything today.
It's because it is your credit card.
It is.
Thus, it is still to your point, to put it the long way.
But they have a new function feature.
I'll track here.
I just recently heard about where it allows you to create a secure card.
One instance trains action that simulates a master card.
I think that's great.
I'm just wondering if some of you will figure that out.
I'll start hacking you with that.
You'll have a virtual storm card.
It's interesting that you start using that.
So going back and back on track, there is a cost associated with data loss.
It really depends on us how far and how much of a risk we're willing to take.
Is it just a small amount of data that can potentially get out?
Or is it my entire database?
It's just not with information traveling over the network.
It's data backup takes.
I don't know if I'm walking the data system back up.
So there's a later security that needs to be put in place.
Both the network and the user's entire data systems.
You know, you're talking about businesses that start off small.
I guess we don't agree.
The demand for paying with is not decreasing.
Of course, medium on one side.
You know, as they say, give me more distance.
I'll use it.
So are the other focus on the other side of this.
As the business grows, you have to come up with a demand with technology, infrastructure, and security.
And again, talking about accurate, you know, a single solution to be 100% effective.
What it is to be right now.
What it is that medium and tech point are offering as a intelligent network security solution.
We're providing a real-time monitor service solution.
Someone is monitoring the traffic within your network 24 or 7.
So going back, you've got a firewall.
You've got your data bar.
You've got your spam filter.
And by the way, I can provide these capabilities as well.
But really, I want to focus on the intrusion detection prevention.
Because that's where it seems like we see the bonus connection out there.
In the area that's not often looked at.
We're actually monitoring and providing real-time, real-time alert status towards going through.
We're looking at the data.
We're looking for signatures.
Even if it's from me, we're just short.
And that's my only kind of thing.
Sorry.
With the sword, it is part of our foundation, the signature from the sword.
And what we do is we constantly manage and write new signatures as part of our long-term monitoring service solution.
But as you can see, starting down the bottom of the gentleman, the customer is in work.
We're actually doing a secure VPN to a device that we have in your network.
I talk about the device just briefly.
It's part of the entire solution.
You can write off by intelligence in technology.
It's a running box.
It's a running box.
Okay.
And it is running specific services within the box that are monitoring the traffic for the signature and reporting back to our security operations center.
Our agents aren't just sitting on the other side.
And the agents are looking at a queue.
And in this queue, we're looking at alerts much like, you see, you know, service alerts coming across.
And we're not familiar with the length side or the wind side.
We're looking at event records and services.
And it is based upon a client's profile, which is typically three levels.
One is, to some extent, you know, I'll get it in the morning, tell me what it was.
Okay.
Default is, if anything, at a high level, and block the IP address.
And if anybody is familiar with PureDark, I'm going to PureDark.
Yeah.
PureDark.
They must have a product at home, isn't it?
Okay.
If you're a PureDark, basically what it's doing is monitoring the traffic that's sitting in your IP address.
It is trying to get into the various ports.
And I get on a foot, tell it, come block that.
And I never want to see it again.
I walk that.
That's not PureDark.
PureDark isn't there.

Just out of the
That was itís me
You see I saw
You saw
When I want to take care of that, it's like, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know
what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, you know I'm talking about infety what I'm talking about, you know holding back and forgiving... you know what that's actually okay.
Right? Well, I want to allow 5 IP address. Certainly there are some IP addresses that you don't want to have
about R&P enabled, right? W, P and Z.
Okay.
And everyone comfortable with what I'm going to talk to you today is a more looking forward to the signature.
Basically, it's looking for that breadth as a known breadth, or even the unknown breadth that we're looking for specific patterns
and what's trying to get in or trying to get out and sending data out.
So as we write these signatures, we were looking at payload.
And the actual breadth, it's actually the code of what's trying to seal the data.
So with that, as we're watching the payload, we're able to analyze each payload is from the script.
And the analysts, as they get through, by the way, are asking how long does it take for an analyst to look at the breadth of the script
and to have it about 15 seconds? Because all they're doing is right clicking and seeing the signature and the information, and they know where it is.
Let's go right out, you know, walking.
Okay. Or a follow-up is a new server in China that's now just hitting the heck out of us.
Our clients, who just walked out of here, I see.
We can actually go in, we won't be trying to look at kids in the severity.
A lot of folks enjoy the reporting because they are able to report the backup to the manager here,
how well they're protecting the network.
That's where they're actually walking.
You have a question?
No, I'm saying they have to get some way to do it.
If they want to know, maybe it's because of the surveys, because they hit up,
because of the word called general abilities.
They want to know what's going on.
They want to put the machine in.
Part of the human mind itself.
We as company did mean that we have to arrest it.
Top destination boards, destination IP addresses, you know, the security, how often they're happening,
we keep a lot of all this information.
We want you to go for a 12-month period of time.
So we'll keep all this activity, all this history and all the money,
but then the device doesn't have it.
Here's your information right here.
Joggo.
There's no other way to give you any of the effects.
It's varying your number of effects.
There's no other way to give you any effects.
I don't really need to say anything on these.
You can see the source IP map.
I don't know why, I guess.
You should know this first.
This one is kind of small.
This is kind of a crack.
So, really.
What we do is we typically walk into an environment.
This is where the industry is.
They do have a firewall.
They have a meeting.
They have the same code for you.
But they're still not sure.
They're not the points.
One of my relations.
We'll go online.
As soon as we go online, it takes about two weeks.
When we go online, you can work with you to figure out what's called positive and what's real.
And then once that goes in place, it's funny.
Because when we work with a partner, okay.
We go for the same thing.
Because they have so many positive points as well.
And the partner of last one, we went online.
But here in this recently,
we were simply 3,000 hits per hour.
And we filled their bag out.
We got all the false positives out.
And finally, here in the back, we were down to 60.
And it's more manageable.
The first round, they said, okay, we got it all.
And we got a different server.
The internal, they were compromised.
Not their servers.
Customer servers.
They were compromised internally.
And lastly, we were going to do a good reply and say,
we're sure we've been compromised with our hands.
But it might not have been their job.
And maybe we should try to get a level of protection.
Let's see what we need to do.
And on a slider,
there's an event today.
Actually, the honest thing there is a chance to find it.
I just logged in earlier,
and started taking these things.
You can make that last five.
One before that one.
Head the word inside in large letters.
I'm going to show my ignorance.
Besides, the thing I said,
I'm maybe the only person here who's not in that screen.
He made me throw on it.
This will do.
Yeah, that one.
I'm going to do my job.
I guess I'm going to bring something to Jay Max,
where he's a large part of the Q2.
He asked me on a corporate network in the US,
being forced to be an unprotected and shared.
I mean,
that kind of security.
Rachel, I don't know where anything is.
I just don't know if you're at the right turn.
But with something like this,
maybe this is a problem out there.
This would show that how to go and track it.
Absolutely.
And think about it.
It's good theory.
You can talk about it.
Think about university.
How, you know, 10 fold,
100 fold, magnitude,
all here appears up that's out there.
Right.
Obviously, the data within the Jay Max is more confidential.
It's a value.
The short answer is yes.
We can also write and customize signature
that will recognize
with some, with a high degree of accuracy
that will actually watch
to make sure credit card numbers don't fall out.
Or, uh,
such security numbers don't fall out.
Or, uh,
or actually ask us to
exploit that,
or were watching for that kind of information.
But the short answer is
if there's someone that's in the, uh,
within the company
that has an infected machine,
yes, will detect it immediately.
Immediately that signature drill will come back to you.
And I'll walk you there.
And I'll see you there.
It's just a report.
It's a day!
Anybody know what I'm running?
It's a report.
It's not in the plan.

Yes, I've polling.
I haven't seen anything special today.
I'm on small news Official Thai.
Thank you so much.
Here is the toi bag I am looking at right now.
No clue how else it looks like.
It'sகistsism.
I don't know if you go to the hotel and you should get on the street and play other games.
Just a little salt in here.
Right now, I can see the footage itself which went on in, so I don't think it was taken
from through what we'll see here.
I think it's incident priority.
Counting, device, queue, the events, time and city, and queue.
But he almost would be coming in.
And if he almost, at this point, we have three analysts on the committee on the show.
He's two, two and a half.
Those are coming in live right now.
And I can view the incident.
What I'm looking at here is the incident in the policy.
If it was a severity, I don't know if it's a severity, which I don't have any right now.
It may show, but it may not be red.
There we go.
Hello.
Hello.
Did everyone else findなるほど?
Not the analysts.
Basically what I can do is look at the general information, I can look at the statement
there.
I can run it over to the new store, see what the store says about it, and so I'm going
to go back into that.
You know, the analyst, so, I'm not going to know every single one of them, another serious
significant ones.
But I'm not going to know each individual, but what I'll do is I'll come here because
of store and the leading edge, I'll come through and understand the severity of it.
Typically, I want to know most of them, I'm going to say what I'm told about 90% of them.
I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to say anything,

where we're probably not the best fit is, is, you know,
is the standard education of students already there,
and they're still doing very absolutely the place,
or if you have, you know, we've spent some firewall solutions in the place,
or it's just as good as the other firewall.
I like to think we're better because it's not some of which is just a hardware technology,
it's the humans that are back in the studio operations.
So, are you limited into the, you know, how you can call,
and you can call, have something not.
You can call us through the operations center right now.
And they're going to answer the phone.
They're going to answer the question.
And that is where, hardware is what comes in,
because it wants to have a client in the place,
typically, they live for life.
So, last, this last, sure, we lost four clients.
Hurry up with the maintenance.
So, I mentioned to you, Senator,
that, you know, serves,
as it was, had a DDoS fact.
Yeah, absolutely.
We know about it immediately.
We keep going.
I mean, it does it out there.
We have all the fact inside and going just, you know,
I mean, you know, we had an accident.
We've had a problem.
I mean, this is all that we want.
Well, there's a signature for a video, that's right.
There's a signature.
We'll see that immediately, like,
based upon the profile that set that client,
you know, how to react to it.
Identically, above the sudden, we see this,
building history is starting to come in through,
within two hours.
We know there's a new storm coming through,
and we start blocking.
It's going to be a little bit of a block for all our clients.
You know, none of our clients.
Now, that has to be absolutely.
And the answer is, be sure that, you know,
when an earthquake goes back to the analyst,
some of these guys are sharing the meaning.
They lit a breeze this time.
And they need to sit here and talk all day long
about the latest things that they've seen out there,
and how it's working.
How cool it is, you know?
The fact that you got in heaven that you have,
You have a completely real diamond frame
with what's out of the internet,
and you can see what's evolving in space.
Real actions, both of them mechanized.
Real, real time action.
Now, what we're not doing is we're not blocking content.
So if someone gets in, and all of a sudden
you start to say we need to start out,
we notice it, we might have lost few records there.
There's few social media numbers that go out on the door.
There's other technologies out there
that we've been trying to better content blocking.
That's more CPU, more resources intensive,
and go to that level.
Some companies are employed back as well.
Because still, we're talking about I.P.S.
and the content blocking.
I want to be a part of that later destruction.
You're probably more than that.
This is pretty good.
I.P.S.
I.P.S.
I.P.S.
I.P.S.

I.P.S.
When is the firewall?
You know, when how good is the firewall?
It's how good the city's where our dates are.
Our city's where our dates both
and say the box itself at a 4 a.m.
and we don't need to remove the box.
We have the energy regions as opposed to the other technologies out there.
In the United States, we have a little firewall.
We don't think it's close base in terms of creeping detection or
creeping action or anything that we don't.
We have never really seen the mean for close base.
Because it goes back.
Change it.
Consoong resources.
So we can stop it in the front, run the back.
Do we have the application here?
location bodies that are out there, you know.
So your assistance is basically behind the switch.
The first tier element of the switch
could have worked after the firewall.
Because you're taking the front with the firewall,
the less with the firewall.
Again, we can't be the firewall.
But 99% of folks that we seek with
where you have that firewall in place.
And what can you expect more?
So still, even if that's when you prevent the information
from getting into the network,
but it does not mean to prevent the denial of service
on the switches until somebody inputs
and blocks them more than you.
Correct.
Correct.
So they're not, I mean,
it's being more likely that we're on your ISP
and it's not probably what you're trying to do.
It's something that you might as well do.
If someone's been in here right here,
probably got a p with a p of s,
and you've got to, you know,
probably just shout or just hit a clipper and hit
and it'll be sent back to something going on.
But it's at the end of the year as well.
And in this case, the deadline is important.
If you want to, you know,
this is the experience of using what it's like.
If you want to know firsthand,
it's a real advantage for you to be able to tell you about it.
But as the aim wanted to get sent here
is going to take you five minutes back there.
And now, because we're already work protecting
the media on this core network,
we go by a segment versus a global.
So if a new client comes online,
and they just try,
it's part of the total number of scary solutions.
So there's some trying to fire a wall.
Maybe anyone has a firewall solution
that they're providing for you.
You'll need to subscribe to the IDPS
in that close statement package.
So that sends us all what's going on.
Because I guarantee you, at that point,
if you realize some of these issues
in a client's environment,
you don't think you're going to try to do it.
Right.
It is the neighborhood of the client's environment.
The environment itself sits in line
so that all the data passes through the requirements.
Is it, or is it promiscuous?
It's promiscuous.
In other words, the idea is sitting there
watching, informing the information as it goes by.
So I'm not actually a risk or a liability.
As far as I mentioned,
you may go up a stand,
or you can put a, what's it called, a tap.
You don't know what a tap.
What is it?
Even this tap is where you sit back there as well.
You can see it, not the tap.
Recall information.
But no, we're not a single point of failure.
I'm not sure what the matter is.
How do you like that?
You get all sorts of matters going through
the impact you'd recognize
the signatures, how are you going to start it back?
We're, you know, I don't know the answer.
I don't know how they're going to work.
I'm thinking if you're just starting
so you have to be involved.
You've got to be part of all of that.
We're not necessarily part of all of that.
You've got to be open to part of all of that.
Yes.
You don't have to be involved.
You don't have to be involved.
Because if you're a mischievous one,
because I expect to see you in this case
more directly.
And it just sits out on the network.
Just watches.
Yes.
If you could support me.
If you would know that all of your decisions
are going to be everything back to all of you.
Which would be, you know.
You're doing right.
You'll feel perfect.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's your, me, is we're not the single point of failure
to the point where we're not in line
and to be at correct cost, ladies.
You know, our system has been so much
distributed in here.
We can see it here.
And it's more about the analysis bandwidth
and the topology.
The topology doesn't change.
So that's quite a big problem.
Most of all, the paper on that work.
So it always leads.
Yeah.
Always.
You can't.
There's no way we'll avoid it.
It's just, you know.
It's anything, anything, anything.
It's a way.
Anything that acts as a resistance.
So.
That's right.
I mean, they could be the same sort of effect.
And I call it the dead VCR factor.
So I get the VCR plot bit more.
There you go.
There you go.
And some of us are distributed in the continuum.
No.
I think so.
No, no, no.
Then, yeah.
The dead VCR, essentially, your VCR dies.
But your cable goes through your VCR.
So we'll watch TV for some.
I don't know.
I'm working on this.
I'm working on it.
I'll be having to find the insurer out,
I'm sure it'll make you.
And it's just I'm just curious.
We're going to make what you're saying, though,
that's the response.
It's fast enough.
Process is wise.
You like to do it.
You're going to try to focus.
But if you get a VOS in this box, you got enough.
So you know, process the power of the hand left.
The little packet.
I mean, yeah, we've got to get this out of here.
So we're going to put it in there and put it in there.
So that's why we're talking about, you know,
this thing probably wouldn't have been a little freaking
on the paper.
Yeah, you mentioned earlier that yesterday,
you're having a university probably seen up on my list.
That was probably the VR.
We're going to stay in the university here as well.
And yet, we'll be at the end for the second time.
Apparently, they lost another computer with a mouse.
So it's just here.
You know, we have to, you know, watch my last year.
Not the one I came up with on my list.
No, I just talked about a list of, okay.
People were trying to run us to disclose it.
Yes.
Okay.
It was interesting.
It was a university on our list.
It was fine.
Again, I have to be real careful.
I'm not talking about everything of our clients.
But that's the university that showed up pretty quickly.
I walked into their office.
It's going to be about four weeks.
I walked into his office.
It was fine.
And as I walked in, and I was completely caught up bar,
and I asked, however, if it was going,
because they asked me to have a meeting with us.
And they said, everything was going fine.
I think when we're in, he says,
I just, I can't believe what's going on.
Of course, my heart is starting to race,
because I think I'm walking into a fine being.
Before we even sit down, he says,
if I weren't such a student,
and I'm going to employ another box,
and I'm not a fan of this segment,
who wouldn't be dealing with the situation
that we're dealing with right now.
Apparently, they, too,
were happy.
They were second hearing facility,
where they didn't have us employing.
And that's it.
So I'll mean this to say,
they were very happy with us,
and we'll provide,
and it's important that they should have had it on the other one.
It's just a matter of other priorities
that came up before they got to it.
Of course, at that point,
it was too late to get lots of information.
Can you meet your own doctor?
Yes, absolutely.
In fact, well,
as you know, Scott,
you didn't see him as one of our own.
Not only what you can see,
you can see probably about 50 out there.
Not just what we're going to want to be,
probably about 10 of those in production.
We can castle and use it.
Maybe on uses it.
I mean,
a bunch of other
that they use it.
And it's not part of
a requirement to sign up with us as a partner.
It's not a requirement at all.
It's in one,
the only way of me on what allow us
come in is by putting the device
in a test mode,
if you will,
to allow Terry and the other folks here
and me on,
to understand
what the speech of functionality,
capabilities,
are in order to put it in the data service.
And again,
don't take my word
or, in fact,
we put you in touch with Terry,
you know,
no Terry,
Terry,
just to see who can first
and why,
do you appreciate
that the device is in line?
So,
and again,
I have fairly many things I can't
speak to some of the technical goals,
I mean,
one type of question you ask,
you don't find that in Israel.
But I can certainly speak to you
of customer references,
partner references,
that are actually using it to the line.
Probably the technical,
the technical,
the technical,
the security,
what's that?
Probably the technical,
the technical,
the security person likes it's,
you know,
how many times,
and it doesn't have to be,
you know,
it doesn't take place.
And,
it's so badly worn in the fridge,
you know,
I was in the home to sleep at night.
Now, believe it or not,
once upon a time,
I worked in a data center,
but I was struggling to specifically
to be able to spare the virus.
You know,
I'm excited,
I was pulled out,
and I think,
you know,
there's not happened.
So, the system is going down,
guess what,
you are still dying.
Do you understand,
Stephen,
you know,
the director is going to be processed,
patient information,
and get access,
and view this project
after the rush in,
to get the system back up.
So,
the point being,
to your point,
is,
yeah, you know,
the sleep at night,
you know,
we'll be good to you anyway.
By the way,
when we go to sleep,
who wakes up?
All right.
Time's for where they live.
You know,
you know,
you're a Russian network,
or, oh yeah,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
that's what I,
you know,
I don't know.
You know.
There are always good moments
when the federal government
has already got this problem,
you know,
they've been having a great time,
in Indiana...
You know,
we just came that way,
if you could,
you know.
You know,
this is what I,
and I have,
this is far,
if everybody,
this is what my email address
or, you know,
might sent you a bar
I think it's the best question I've heard all night, and it's a great one.
The theory right now is in the project to go through the valuation savings right now.
Offer first of all points.
We have been running it for two years.
We've just never productized it.
It's interesting which in fact, all of what you see in some of the needs is the hosting company.
As the company is involved or changed their clothing if you will.
Saw and need to hit this market.
That's where it's actually not.
It's really evolving.
In fact, it's using wire and wire.
And it's hard and hard to keep up with.
The question was specialized today.
Maybe it's from each company.
I do it.
We're trying to harness it.
We're able to stream it through.
What's that insanity track?
We said that.
We're on the side.
The definition of insanity.
It's going to be the same thing.
We're over it.
It's taking them on results.
Well, the match in that project and the competition.
Talking about it.
I can keep up with it as it is today.
Because something new is changing every day.
But if you have specialized data, that takes you apart.
That's made in Asia.
Or made in America.
Doesn't matter.
I mean, I can get in the hood of my car.
Okay.
More big in the room.
Yeah.
I can download the documents.
I know where you get documents.
I don't know.
But it doesn't mean you're qualified to try to repair it.
Yeah.
It's just a world we do.
You know, we're trying to permeate it.
We're trying to permeate it.
I mean, I have to pull my key down.
So it's going to be a moment.
I must be scared to do it every day.
It's going to be a lot more script.
It's just like that.
It's really good.
Yeah.
I don't know where we're going to do that.
It's really good.
I think that's exactly what we're going to do.
Well, I'll look at it in the same way.
That's what we're going to do.
I think it's going to be the same thing over and over.
It's all the same.
I'm just going to go back with the shortcut.
You're going to need to know the little attack.
No, that's here.
No, that's true.
I think, if you did the same thing over and over again,
and you expected it from,
it was all feel the,
feel clear yourself.
Thinking than like,
we all said,
this one stitch isn't connected.
So you think,
well, somehow we're able to ожид carnage
He just made some points out there, so the virus is a box.
I usually only use this one because it's not that deep in jail.
So what can I do?
Oh, you have to.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
Thank you very much for the evening.
I know what you're saying.
I guess it's not that hard to make.
It's just the end of the strike.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
I have to stop.
