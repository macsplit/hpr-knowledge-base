Hello everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and I'm here alive as OddCamp in UK and I'm
talking to Jürgen and Jürgen is going to talk to us about OWN, the Open Wireless Death
work in depth 4.
So can you tell us a little bit about that and what makes it so special?
Well it's very special because it's community based and it drives a lot of public access
points which are open, so no encryption, so it's just open access points and all these
success points are let's say in a very close range so they can see each other and they
run the OLLSR as a management demon and this service routes the traffic to the
success point to the internet so every user who is part of this also has his interconnection
and he's sharing his interaction with the public so everyone who sees success points
which you are in close range, you will see it, you can connect to it, they will come
a tiny pop-up which just tells you that you are on this network because otherwise you
would not know, they just have to be next and then you are not bothered again, you have
free internet so all ports open, complete, open it and this is like a shared network
for the community, yeah it's from the community for the people in depth 4 and Greenwich and
it's so to say everyone can be part of wants to be, he gets a small router and he can
so to say put the router on the window to have a good reach for the outside so that everyone
outside can connect to it, so being a good neighbor basically.
So the idea would be that if I was in the community I'd have a cable or DSL line and
then I'd share that line with the community, what do the ISPs think about that?
Well theoretically you should ask them but basically they don't mind because for them it's
just traffic and they cannot really see where it comes from, I mean the final IP address
is always the individual user's IP address which is showing to you so they will think
it must be come from the user obviously, yeah I'm all but you say to the major critic
of open Wi-Fi networks or what about kidney porn and how do you reject children and what
if somebody downloads legal movies over on my network?
Yeah well I think the latest action against this was a little let's say kind of a throttling
of the network so the network was throttled down so that you don't have full bandwidth
of the users you have a certain limits which makes let's say sharing in a high volume
usage doesn't make it really feasible because it's no fun so it's just let's say like a basic
feature if you're in the laptop outside you want to quick check your emails or make something
quicker either you just have access without any fuss so it's just you have it and the other
big advantage for the user who drives this access point is also a very good point that they
have a backup in their access so literally if if their interconnection dies or you switch
ISP or whatever you do you can at least expect three weeks offline and if you want to deal
with that but with this network so to say if the router boots up and you use the text that
you don't have in the access it automatically roots your traffic through your OWN access
point through to the network and therefore outside you so you always have a kind of a say slow
but you have interconnection which can be very important okay so say I'm living in that
community and I've got an ISP connection and I want to be a good community member what do
I need what do I need to do well you just go to the home page which I have to have from my
Don't worry it'll be in the show notes so you can google for OWN and tap for you and find
immediately and the guys make every Wednesday from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. they have wireless
Wednesday where everyone is divided everyone can come and you get all the details and you
get the router and 10 as in all the usual technical gossip from the from the guys who drive
the network and who pays for the is it an additional access point that I that I plug in so can I
have my own part of my own network and yes you can still give your own but it's more fun to
switch your own off because this access point is this router which you will get will represent
two access points one which is hidden so to say this is for you so it's unsrattled so you
know the name you can connect it anytime you want so you have your own unlimited connection
and the other one is the public one which is of course banned with throttles right
now but I mean if the network behaves well it can be also open so this is just a
kind of configuration of the and who pays for that additional equipment well the router
let's say if you want to be part of the community of course at one point you have to buy
the router because you have it I mean we have a router but it's very cheap we talk about 50 quid
yeah yeah so it's not not a mount we need to and also you don't have to have a router
you just can also just connect if you want to have a first touch and see how the network
performance is you just have a laptop you connect to it use it fantastic
a lot of people do that so I've been thinking about something that for our own
community is that something that I information on how to set that up would that be available on the
website yeah sure sure tell you exactly our information which router this is router
you can buy them for dinner as well so to say they're just flashed with special
firmware to make them functionality for that network I mean they are kind of
centrally controlled I mean they are not completely left to the users control so
they are centrally controlled and to see also how the network evolves and how it just how it grows
yeah okay fantastic all come start inside so I think we'll cut that short
