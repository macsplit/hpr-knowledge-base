Hey, christen fresh, I am Morgan the low-tech mystic, and you, well you, my friends, would
be listening to Hacker Public Radio for January 3rd, 2008.
Today's topic. Lost audio from Heycombe.
All right, thank y'all for tuning in for another wonderful. I got to use those
air quotes. Wonderful. At least when it's more delin' doing this. Now the
wonderful episode of Hacker Public Radio. Thank y'all for inviting me into your
audio players and here we go. Today's audio is going to be some pre-recorded
audio. I'm feeling a little bit under the weather so instead of doing the
original audio I'd plan for. What we're going to do is I'm going to play back
some audio from Heycombe, which was a use those air quotes again. It was a
computer conference that the Infonomicon Computer Club. We put together, we
had the fancy idea that it'd be fun to do a computer conference like out in
the middle of the field like where everybody comes and camps out instead of doing
it like in a hotel. So we decided to do a little test run this year in
Mississippi and basically what it boils down to is just an excuse for a bunch of
a bunch of us to get together and camp out in a beautiful area of Mississippi
during some beer and hang out and kind of just unplug for a couple days and
just enjoy one another's company. It was a really good time. We had overall
a good time. What we're going to do now is I'm going to play some audio of one
night. There was alcohol involved obviously. We decided to go on a midnight
geocache. So if you're familiar with geocaching then you know what's up. If
you've never heard of geocaching then you need to be hitting Google right
now and typing in geocaching but basically what geocaching is is people go
out to random locations either in the woods or in urban environments and they
hide things in a little boxes. Sometimes camouflage very covertly and they put
the coordinates of the item up on a little trail or a website and then give
you clues and you kind of have to give a starting point and then you follow the
trails and they vary from cash to cash and it's something fun to do if you've
got a GPS receiver it's definitely something to check out if you don't have one
and hey be something to look into GPS receivers are getting cheap that'd be a
good way to get out of the house and have some fun and still not betray the
nerd instincts there so without any further ado without any further ado
please enjoy this audio of myself droops and five big tramsing around the
woods in the middle of the night in the middle of the Mississippi as I
probably say 400 times in this audio clip like beep that out but you guys get
to enjoy it yeah this was just a little background I guess before we go into
it droops is from Mississippi or was and he had a bunch of geocaches that he had
done in the area and he had several night geocaches which meant they were only
really applicable to be done at night they involved using a flashlight and
reflectors and you'll hear more about it but it was a really good time so
basically it's the three of us myself droops five big tramsing around in the
woods I grabbed my laptop as we were going down to the geocache so here I've
got my tablet PC and tramsing around in the middle of the woods and it was just
kind of it was it was a really fun time so I hope that comes through in the
audio with nothing else and yeah nothing else I don't know somebody else will
be here tomorrow
and time coordinates right now well for time it is 1148 on Friday in November
9 2008 and we're currently at Haycon and I am looking back up buddy left
with that little geocache that we're getting ready to do in the middle of the
night which is involving reflectors and we're looking for the reflector as we
speak to mark the geocache
and it's low like a high foot so we're riding around right now I'm not sure how
much battery life I have I hope this doesn't die in the middle but I'd like to do
a little see what we can't find here maybe this will be horribly terrible to
listen to and maybe this will be entertaining and this is the good stuff
that goes on here at Haycon in the middle of Mississippi in the middle of the
night and you thought it'd just be all about penises
and it's a little doubt reflectors and so we're looking what color are they just
white we're looking for a clear reflector like a bicycle reflector for listeners
at home perhaps like a thumbtack reflector yeah as we what's our kind of
velocity 25 miles an hour as we spotlight trees on a gravel road
and I'm going to pause for the silk of our battery life here because we are
recording with all the acidity and hopefully this isn't clippin too much
out and around yeah I've gone on super low power mode so we can't
reflectors are something to the gravel you will be back in just a second
hey guys we are back and it is currently just to give a little roster here it
is myself more going groups and five big and we have successfully located the
reflectors and troops has located his walking staff perhaps he will speak
softly but he always carries a big stick that's right in a me run with the
laptop but so here we are in the middle of the night and these reflectors to
give you an idea of the size of the reflectors these these look like
thumbtacks basically so like a thumbtack that you use to to post posters up on
your wall but so as we swap through the woods in the middle of the night here in
the middle of Mississippi in the middle of nowhere what's what you explain a
little bit if you will about this geocache what's involved and motivation
behind it what are what are we doing here trotting through the woods looking at
reflectors okay people hide shit and they post coordinates for such things with
their GPS and they think it's a really cool spot or really cool hide and this
one's a night cash which means it's really hard to do during the day because of
the reflectors obviously and what I did this I was with my dogs and my wife and my dogs
got down the bottom of the still and broke something and then we ran through the
woods chasing after them putting reflectors on trees until we got pretty lost
and then we said between a good spot so basically we were living a wild moment
we traced with if you will Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs yeah and hundreds of
people before us have also lived this moment excellent and so do we do we have a
it it was merely there weren't a lot of there weren't any nightcashes in the
area other than what I hit really far away from town so one of when closing
the town to people to get to explore do I find it really hard to find a good
moment no good reason and a lot of people come out here at night looking for
these things and I hope it doesn't disappoint
and this one has a surprise ending shall we say
but some people figure out these guys didn't I wouldn't have
let's see now it'll be instructions on this or to follow the reflectors until you get to a big
like x marks the spot kind of thing and two were definitely not an x negative but from the
school right out of recent college I know that two points do make it back to if we can find
two other points maybe right here and to our left we know it's a whole lot more dots
so somebody's been sneaky or the the quarry that was being chased on this particular day was uh
well I'm providing this cash for a second to be a complete jackass but I'll tell
it over the whole tree whenever you see two dots in the tree that means um
so not only is it shopping through the woods in the middle of the night but we're also
it's like a it's like a little puzzle yeah you can you can see one two three four five six dots ahead
of you correct so in a way it's just kind of like we're getting to uh
to live life for a few scant moments as if we were uh say our favorite hero from the legend of
Zelda maybe mr. Link was stomping around the woods in the middle of the night or
other uh suck set adventures mr. Link would definitely be our favorite hero from
wise and Zelda seeing it how they're such a wise selection
there's a good ravine there and some bars
and if you're lucky that's all you'll take home from hay con
and
and uh yeah do we have quite this little ravine here and the laptop we're going to pass the
laptop got it oh got it all right into bars
and oh it burns it burns there we go
too bad we can't see the same thing for syphilis
hopefully we won't find that avoid the blue bales just just like in Zelda you know
oh
we continue on we're um we hit another one of these really far out of town where it was raining
and i got piss drunk we had a bottle of coke and a bottle of jack and we just traded the whole way
there each taking a sip and then go into the next one
all right so here as we come along the trial and we see two dots so since we've had our little
spoiler hint we know to look for a change of direction there which we see again which is
once again crossing the uh the big change which is a little more little friendlier this time
but it was frankly called it's raining and while you and i went to hide this thing is drunk and
apparently we went in a bunch of circles and in reflection
so it was a uh especially mean one because the geocache was actually a tree
suspended from the road and in daylight you can do much pure sight but at night time no one's
going to be like oh what's that hand in that rope in the tree
well there's a bit of a jackass name a bunch of hills up and down slippery and uh
a lot of people went out there couldn't find it but it just made it better
better for you and maybe not so better for them possibly but we noticed here our dots have come
to another symbol which appears to be um across we've got three vertical and five horizontal
and we also have a fallen tree with a tack in it the uh we must update our quest
the thumbtack
I wonder pretty damn well built because these are several years old in the woods
excellent so this cache has existed four years it's rusted all around it
the thumbtacks and the same path
so as we approach the tree here with the uh the cross on it
you notice that uh she's also right next to the road
and uh i don't know all these reflectors yeah are they oh there they are i'm right across this tree
again hints yeah the big circles but uh so possibly we've discovered another signal that a cross
means maybe you're crossing something oh yeah
the thumbtack through the woods here and running into each other
it's the middle of the mile and the middle of the second one the middle of the darkness itself
so far uh our listeners at home while they i guess listen to us if they're still listening
listening to that it is yeah and then and the clipping that that's me carrying around the uh the
the tablet as if it were a pizza pie i'm trying to have a Brian Fessig crap that we are
you're pretty brave do you have a skin on that tablet no don't
which which was bringing me into our next point for those uh at home listening if they'd like to play
an at home game perhaps we could uh wager which is more crazy the fact that we are in the middle of
the woods and uh random Mississippi or we are in the woods in the middle of the night which is
flashlights or the fact that i am in the woods in the middle of the night
my laptop is logging around i'm trying not to fall in trenches and
at least you can't fall in the syphilis right okay
all right all right yeah all right we got it going across another trench here i'd like to really
apologize for i'm sure all the clipping that i'm getting but uh we've noticed that oh there's
our for a second there it looked like we lost our tap look at that hand really but our our
direction our direction our vector because we have both momentum and direction so we have a vector
but there's a necessarily mean we're going anywhere right now the first rule of geodash is first in mark
where you went into the woods that yeah you can find a way back to be a thing
yeah which which is a good point to uh bring up that if you're going to take your laptop out into
the middle of the woods you know it might have been a good idea to bring the GPS receiver you know
in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the middle of the bryers or your friendly
or the friendly sharper neither which are present tonight
oh we do hey there's a mushroom and it is a i don't know it is not a type of mushroom that grows
in the area that i'm from so i'm not familiar with it as there are many edible and non-edible
along with magic i'm not just talking about magic but i'm talking more about being able to
live off the area that you're passing through and so if you had to be stuck out in the woods because
you've got lost with reflectors because you at least know what to use they wouldn't kill you then
why big notes is a big cluster we notice some particular shape let's see
now this cluster perhaps the cluster fuck
i'm gonna stomp
let's see we have a stomp they kind of looks like a cross
or more of a plus what can i say bucket there's a bucket so i can see
reflectors i hope that's all the vehicle okay so we have cleverly just walk day
have it on you've been listening to this minus a little bit of editing out
i'm walking in a big circle so at least you're catching this uh
along with using our creativity to find the bucket that's right on the ground in front of us
i also get a little exercise so we've had the container possibly upgraded let's just
bet that's kind of neat somebody's going to come behind the geocache and i don't know is that
is that a good thing yeah there's probably something wrong with the container or someone sold the
container no oh so we have apparently someone is replaced to container with a container that's
in a container so they have upgraded so not only that they enjoyed your cash but noticed that
you know hey oh something's going wrong here and let's uh do something one of the positive
things about the geocache community here Mississippi is they will look after other people's stuff
so as as uh we open the the container if you will five it will you explain what you're what
you're seeing there in uh in the second bucket uh in the second bucket you have your basic uh
geocache goodies of course in your zip lock bag we have the logbook and uh it's like a little
fun coin okay cool and then of course uh on the inside of the container you have your various
trading trinkets uh you've got a little like tupperware thing very small tupperware
might have been something in there at one point uh you've got a nice bag clip for the Mississippi
Department of Agriculture at agriculture and commerce and uh in case you're wondering lester
spelled junior is the commissioner of that and uh we've got a little key ring here uh some cars
we had a cash that was a name plastic container yeah it was one of the oldest caches in the state
and they do a lot of control burning around here and apparently it was found after a control barn
mm-hmm and the gentleman working for the park service that found it looked into what was going on
and actually replaced it with a metal ammo can and much better than it had been so not only
maintained but upgraded but upgraded because i mean fire and a melt stuff what inside this
so yeah let's let's open this uh sip lock bag which has our well-preserved uh toy coin
and a memo book and let's let's read through here it was a cash fairly replaced bring up 2007
and push mataha found it and webchimp found it and since it's been replaced two people have found
three people we have another thing so what are the dates that it's been found on October 20
October 21 and uh it's September 2
so all three recent finds after they would have an ink pen and there was an ink pen included
in the bag awesome so let us uh we record the fact that we are located this geocache
right now who we are and that we're at the beginning of the uh the broadcast here but I will
verify the current time coordinates it's based time coordinates it is now 1210 on November 10th 2007
spectacular so our sign your name though temporal shipping and that's currently my geocaching name
trying to have uh the same name in different organizations because as we learned
earlier our hero link you know i mean he he changed his name up you know every game wasn't the same
you got to do something to keep it fresh so otherwise uh gaining can easily track you down as
you're reborn through the many generations of Hyrule and uh you don't just sign an
name if you want to write something inspirational or anything you're welcome to do such things
take a moment to uh inspire the young here oh that's kind of convenient how the truck's right there
that that it is as seen as how it was just brought up that uh we didn't have a GPS device in that
we could be stranded after a walking very far in the woods following reflectors that are no longer
facing the direction that we were walking so i'm going to leave a note here in this pattern and say
uh more gallon was here and take on hey con beta because this is a beta test of our con
and uh so alphalus this summer mean you living together i guess so yeah yeah so i don't know
what night's what syphilis is released candidate one okay yeah yeah okay and uh yeah
enjoy what's something that you die of an organ trail
oh syphilis you know syphilis this is Terry this is Terry oh dude okay apparently this one should
be called dysentery no we're gonna replace everything back into the bag and try to hide it better
when we found it because apparently it's not supposed to be just laying on the ground even though
when it is on the ground and right in front of you it is still a challenge to find it
thanks this tree and it was um probably kind of far would like a lot of
and uh it looks like it had a little termite damage though yeah it's definitely uh
i'm not gonna miss your steam car whatever these three it's free and uh cash and
handers probably tell me metal ammo cans are usually uh pretty left over by the red necking people
all right let's hide this thing good let's off this ground or that that was it was what
looks like we can see it was buried several inches yeah covered with leaves yeah and not
to mention that we have the fact of darkness yeah to aid in this uh endeavor exactly see and once
again we find ourselves just like Link we're traveling back and forth between worlds of lighting dark far away from the cash
yeah
so we've placed a uh a nice log on top of our can and they covered everything up with the leaves
which were not taken directly from the area of the can because that would be kind of obvious
so and we're making it quite more hidden so not only do you have the darkness but you have the
evil powers much like Ganon working against you now too too too many sticks is obvious
so if the leaves are good leaves are good too many sticks look like you're hiding something under
some sticks so we have a professional tip here we had a um cash and a city that apparently was near
park and some young folks found it and decided to steal it and move at about 20 feet
covered out with stuff and hide cigarras inside of it still in their individual wrappers
which they apparently didn't know what was going on because they were hiding a metal container in
the woods from guys who for a sport find metal containers in the woods so uh yeah it was found
pretty quick and I had a bunch of free cigarras that's it excellent
so we are we are now we have completed our quest for the geocache five they get successfully
re-hidden okay very skillfully and we are now going to go see a cemetery it's kind of makes
it a little bit more sense in the middle of the night I don't know whatever I don't know if
anything makes sense at this point but you know lack of sleep makes full fun stuff and hopefully
fun listening so we're going to walk back to the truck and uh maybe we'll pick back up here if we
can locate the cemetery uh if we can find the reflectors I don't know do souls have reflectors
I don't think they might in some form maybe maybe some spirit orbs I don't know we don't have any
real uh real-time technology here but no I don't just rambling oh thank you
okay
brothers we're driving down the road and I'm sure we're clippings some more we're going to get a
little description here of the uh the cemetery that we're headed towards
all right this cemetery this whole park is very here in a place I still live and after I
quit living there um I drove past and on the big highway going home from it on out and this
cemetery is on the USGS map and it's several acres large and I really think they had just
there they were like it's sitting here so it took me a long time to find this thing
and took a lot of research and noticing the way the land is laid out to figure out where they
would build a cemetery because in my mind building a cemetery on the hillside is really dumb
right so the first thing I did was check all the flat land inside that big area they'd
marked out
and it wasn't there so then I went looking around and the trip was up and down and I had friends come out
and eventually we found where we thought a house had been so we said maybe the cemetery is near
this house you should be a community here a hundred years ago there was a post office in there here
and uh there's nothing now just a couple of mobile homes in the old shop
um and the cemetery only is map I've only found two or three tombstones here but they're
cool looking and uh it's nice to walk down this nice easy walk excellent so not maybe searching
for reflectors no just searching for buyers excellent thanks for the tour
thanks lord hey no problem there's a very creative pie that damn near a pumpkin find it now
now it'll take you i'll see tomorrow that is the dryer ant kick trip
and um which are all still better than syphilis
they're all still better than syphilis the guy that I hit it with um I think stole it hey there's a
shotgun in the ship yeah is he got kind of mad at me one day and the stick that I'm carrying right
now there was one very similar to it hitting hitting at this cache in its inception and I think he wanted
it and um he usually went up there and took it and took the cache because as we'll find out
tomorrow no one stumbled upon this randomly a week after it was hidden
and I actually found this cemetery at night with a flashlight on the way home to see my girlfriend
I just stopped by I thought it did my hat I know where it is and it was exactly where it was
after months of searching it's not constant searching but
so preparation was this just like a uh a moment of revelation when you just
sitting class daydreaming and I realized hey a picnic that's where it is and that's what it was
and we'd actually walk through the area but we were looking for a much larger cemetery
um according to the park lady it had a gate and uh she was referring to it completely different
when apparently she couldn't read the map that I showed her I think what's this cemetery look like
where is it she's like oh it's got to be gate but there's one about the same spot
if you turn south off of this road on the left hand side so I turn the door I think I'll win my
okay but you're off according to the map you're in the cemetery right now you've been so
since we parked and uh we found on the left here what we thought was a house it's a little way
out here and I've yet to figure out where exactly this road ends up to walk till we could walk
anymore and it just kind of keeps going like this and it's a road and this just clearly looks like
an old road for what I don't know but it's deterioration-weezing way okay across from this
across the little part graveyard that will road ride is a continuation of this road
and see how it's like these banks really high right this is an old road that this is wagons on this
fire and uh I think this is the road that just continued on to the next town and now we you know
drive past it 65 miles an hour you know right over there and it lays forgotten that it used to be
this road I mean the banks now taller than we are all right we're looking at a bank that's
eight feet nine feet yeah at least in the dark and both sides and no reflectors no
reflectors
which walking and cemetery in the middle of the night is always fun
that's good that's spooky
I used to remember he never wrote you a trouble pod that is true
and if I came across some guy that decided he was going to shoot me for best classic on
federal land then by damn I was going to get the shit out of him as I'm running away
so
so while we're out here walking around and well after midnight in the middle of the night
searching for uh the destinations to old forgotten roads, cemeteries and stuff like that
one maybe led to the question of not only why you do this but what would inspire somebody to
go out what what's what's the what draws you to do this what got you interested in this kind of
thing because it's definitely interesting and we clearly are out along with you sharing
in the experience and enjoying it so but what gets one interested in um student of history and
this is a lot of forgotten history and I can't really you know do a lot of history discovery
you know just as a college student are now self-employed dude we're going all the time
so I can do simple things like this
yeah I think we definitely won't pass it go a little farther um
this is history that people don't know that we can find and it's like um
discovering something again which is what history kind of it is
um there's a lot of cemeteries that now they were destroyed or the buildings around
were destroyed during civil war or the aftermath of the civil war
okay during the day I think it's good obviously good I think
well let's see trees but Mark I don't know if that's now quenched in on um if you notice the bank
kind of slopes like somebody's walked up this a bunch times and during the day you can see a lot
better the trees are just a little different like someone have planted them for a purpose
apparently somebody's hutted through here because yeah we do see you
so now we find ourselves let's get on another quest
possible hunting trail possible geocache
possible uh vampires zombies
six yeah awesomeness six and we have a cemetery
and we have one two markers three so we have one it's almost kind of like a small obelisk
it's about three and a half to four feet no three feet inside or on space and then uh
the regular tombstone on September 11 1861
civil war started 1861 and died 1909 good deal it was amazing apparently
as we noticed by the symbols on the on the tombstone and this is the one that is
as I thought from a distance was shaped like an obelisk but it's not an obelisk this is violet the
wife of Monroe Stevens who died august 28 1905 63 years old gone but not forgotten
the people that weren't supposed to forget are apparently dead too but she clearly is not
forgotten because we are here and in some way in this any bitty little stone next to it
initials is the center and an m and an a it appears uh let's say maybe her granddaughter
is this one which is buried on top of the old lady
very popular thing
and this is the only tree I've ever found are three
for this you know multi-acre cemetery
you know if there's anything you're in the day and night
oh this is definitely very nice first thing
and it's definitely a nice refresher from the Worgum of Roleman for the day
well um I used to ball here for USGS mapping service
and a map corn or we would identify things to be to go on map my government makes maps of
everything and they are strategic maps with nothing else um we used a compass to orient where you're
going you need something to identify on the map that you can see so like a church or a water tower
something has a reference point yes the guide you clone and they like to keep these things
updated this church is coming up a dead people don't move and there's a lot of
cemeteries on these things and I was really into the cemetery thing and I thought hey
I can get free maps and I can add all these cemeteries to these USGS maps
but apparently after I got the information they don't give a shit about cemeteries
which makes me believe this is not a map of the area this is a strategic map
that if they ever have to take them as a sippy they want to know where the the high points are
the strategic locations yeah or where they want to be and not necessarily what the history
what was once here
which I think if they're going to have a quad map of everything in the United States they need to have
stuff on it like they build they you know put little squares where there's houses
but they can do that satellites and I think this should keep track of where cemeteries are
just a point in sight the old nasal live-in was defied or defiled because it was one of these
hidden old lost cemeteries and someone stole all the tombstones and built a land development
you know housing development on top of it and during the project they discovered they were
building it on top of the graveyard fortunately and then they found all the tombstones
dumping the creek very nearby and the lady that told me this story I think had defiled the guy that
had started you know the land development and she felt it moved all the tombstones I think she
had moved his in the whole night because you know what goes on comes around and I'm not into
desecrating the dead but you move some ice tombstone to be a jackass makes some money then you
don't really deserve to have one which also goes back to you know I mean put yourself in
some golden rule you know do you want others that you would wish done to you yeah
she's a one crazy lady as apparently the three of us are yeah
um scroood this is a ninja night school radio sorry no no ninja night school long since
died okay leave that died um let me sure it died just if you go back and check the date as we
have uh we've actually experienced two days in this recording our temple shifting all at once
as we uh this is a supernatural supernatural yes this is a supernatural sound tour of uh the
acorn experience well tomorrow night I will take you all to a uh massive abandon cemetery
that tells us we're here in this little thing and uh we'll go around and read all the names
well I'm definitely gonna have to recharge my laptop battery so that we can share this
experience with the listeners if there are any listeners yeah all this recording them out in
the cemetery we've been making pretty good time for everyone you know flat ground since then
that's the trail that it is a very old road which is it's kind of interesting and we're walking
along some parts are very soft much like sand well worn in some some places are more like a like an
old cracked stone pavement you know just want a natural ridge is that what I'm seeing here
is it stark oh well there's those but it goes you far on either side you're gonna fall down
the hill okay like that tombstone or those gray yards were or they go go it was on the hill
which leads me to believe maybe there were more tombstones and they've either been knocked over
walled away right and up barefoot tram from the through there looking for them and those are
all three
and the battery died
well I hope everybody enjoyed the audio of the midnight rambling in the woods
and if nothing else well you have a new party game so everybody take a drink anytime I mention
Mississippi or being in the woods double shot for syphilis you know you guys build on from there
and guys are creative bunch but nothing else thanks for tuning in today for a hacker public radio
and stay tuned for another fantastic episode no air quotes needed when it's not me and wonderful
episode of hacker public radio coming at you tomorrow
thank you for listening to hacker public radio hbr sponsored by caro.net so head on over to
c-a-r-o jacking tree for all the folks in the
you
