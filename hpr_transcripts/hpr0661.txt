When first I heard of war driving, it was an exotic sport, unreachable by my
meager means. You needed a portable machine with Wi-Fi and a link to a GPS
unit. The nicer setups directly populated a map so you could enjoy your
finds at a glance. There was even a written language devised called war
shocking so you could leave a mark to others that Wi-Fi is available here.
Now all you need to do is load war drive onto your smartphone, put on a good
pair of minimalist shoes, and go for a walk.
Currently on the database of my Android phone there are 114 connections
detected of which 18 are wide open. After a good walk while running
war drive you can go into the settings and upload your database to wiggle.net so
everyone can enjoy your treasure hunt. One of the best things about war
driving is seeing how creative your neighbors can be. The following is a selected
reading of SSID's. VW Audi Guest, Nighthawk, Freddie, Myohana 6, Jeff is the
man, Striker, Deepcore, Local Area Connection, Barcode, Rush, Foxclan, Peabody,
Mission, QB Tax Plan, Monkey, Higo, and Cactus Grass.
