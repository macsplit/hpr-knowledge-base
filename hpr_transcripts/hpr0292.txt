What about this, you'll be open to us In the community how to say without
an agenda to us? What about addition's words for free?
And everything that it was based around, they could hear it in air?
What if they weren't allowed to take fiscal contributions from hungry corporations?
And looking for wrench creation?
What if money wasn't the issue, could rather offer philosophy?
It wouldn't have been nice to see a worthy community
An open source community
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way
It should be
People helping people, because they want to
There it's not that, it's not that, it's not that difficult to deal
What if music could be open to us?
And the artists worked with the community, with an an agenda to endorse
What if record companies were for free?
And everything that it was based around, they could hear it in air?
What if they weren't allowed to make pop culture decisions?
And concentrated more on the artistic decisions?
What if money wasn't the issue, and they accepted offer philosophy?
It wouldn't have been nice to see a worthy community
An open source community
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way it should be
People helping people, because they want to
There it's not that, it's not that, it's not that difficult to deal
Freedom was born out of equality
And don't believe me as the Boston Tea Party
Freedom was born out of wanting what is right
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes you're gonna have to fight
You're gonna have to fight, you're gonna have to fight
Freedom was born out of wanting what is right
Sometimes, you're gonna have to fight
Freedom was born out of wanting what is right
Freedom was born out of wanting what is right
Freedom was born out of wanting what is right
