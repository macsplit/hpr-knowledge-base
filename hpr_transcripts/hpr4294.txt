This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4294 for Thursday 16th January 2025.
Today's show is entitled, Schedule Audio Recordings on the command line a bit of fine tuning.
It is hosted by Kevvie and is about 5 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Kevvie tweaks the Krontab command for better results with multiple recordings.
Hello, hello, this is Kevvie and welcome to another episode of HPR.
It's amazing how one show can actually develop into a small series of shows.
This one is a continuation of the one that was started HPR 4249 and it was audio streams
on the command line and then that was followed up by HPR 4287 which was Schedule Audio Recordings
on the command line and to be honest I hadn't actually expected to do the follow up but I
just thought that it actually needed a follow up and after using this for a few weeks
I'm actually having to refine this a wee bit so this is again continuation so if you haven't
listened to these so that is HPR 4249 and HPR 4287 then I highly recommend you go and
check these.
Now just a wee bit, just kind of a tweak.
The last time I did this I set up a Krontscript for recording Dan Lynch's midweek pick and
mix and the stream itself, the URL I gave you, that worked fine for me when I just told
it the stream.
However the first time I did it I noticed oh no file so I tried running just the FFMP command
and noticed that actually there was an error in it and it was because the URL has that semi-colon
question mark it kept on giving me a known command VER equals 737183.mp3 and I'm going oh okay
so the way I got running that was I took the URL and I put it into tiny URL and so it's
httpss tinyurl.com forward slash 4pd3txdc and that absolutely worked fine now there was another
thing though that I wanted because I thought well quite often if I go away I'm usually away for
two or three weeks at a time because I live on the island of Lewis and I don't tend to pop over
for a weekend to the mainland so usually if I'm going somewhere it's a holiday it's very often
actually because we're in a fairly mild part of the world we don't actually get that cold winter
but we get very mild summers so I quite like to go to the med site plus being one of the places I
really do like to go so when I go there I usually go for two or three weeks to get out a bit of
now what is it vitamin D I think I can't remember maybe somebody else so I know that the sun provides
it anyway but I usually go for a while so I thought is this going to work if I leave it and I
don't touch it so I thought I'm not going to touch the file so this was I decided I was going to
set my the bug task been my guinea pig let's see and first week it recorded it no problem
however with the command from last time where I had just said use the ffm pig and then at the end
just put the file name that's no problem it works however what I discovered was I waited
it I waited and looked at it to see what would happen if I left the file where it is and it was
asking it to record something with the same name I thought would this produce you know like if
you download the same file twice you get like a one after it I thought will it do that will it
number it in some way and to my lack of satisfaction all it did was say file already exists abort
so I was well disappointed so I thought okay what we can do here is use the date command
right so now what I would recommend you do is after your file name put down the dollar sign
and then open brackets date and then plus and then inverted commas percentage capital Y
underscore percentage M underscore percentage D invert commas again close brackets and then
just keep your dot org or dot MP3 whichever one you're going to use at the end that actually has
worked quite nicely because not only is it given me the file name it's also given me the date
that attaches a date that it was recorded so a year month day and the best of that is it'll keep
it in order for you so yeah that's just and we like I said edit to the crown tab file don't worry
I'll put this into the show notes so you can actually see this right so quite a quick episode there
but I thought one that was actually very important especially if you're like me and you go away for
a few weeks on end and if you've got a weekly shoot record or even not kind of something that's
on three times a week then this is something that I would highly recommend that you do
