bunch of box fixes, so that was it really, as far as I could read it up, Ubuntu is gonna be a bit
behind with releasing this into theirs, but they will do this. And did anything strike you out of
the release? Do you want us with you? I didn't even pay attention about the stuff you mentioned.
I'm going to call, no. There are sort of 14,000 commits to that release there. Which is average,
right? I mean, it's not a huge number. No, but if you compare that to your other open source
projects, that's obviously by way, by far the most active project, right? Well,
I would reckon it's one of the biggest open source distributed open source community projects.
We'll wonder if it better works on the planet. As a matter of fact, I cannot think of anything bigger
right now. Maybe, maybe, maybe apart from browser stuff, like Roadmium or even Firefox.
Maybe in terms of overall K-log as in killer lines of code.
No, I mean, browser tends to be fairly comprehensive these days. Yes.
Clocking in at a couple of million gallons of code, I would reckon similarly on a similar scale,
the kernel weighs in, give or take. I haven't done a line count recently, but that would be my
assumption that we would be looking at at least 5 to 10 million lines of code, some flotters.
Maybe I'm wrong. Well, if you compare that to, oh, no, you're a factor of 5.
Because it's 10.8 million lines. 20,000, right? Okay. Wow.
Yeah, I mean, it's when you think about the likes of an Oracle database, which has 20 million
lines of code as well, I think the 20 or two, many millions. And then if you look, I'll say a
bit is project that's 70,000. There's other big ones out there, right? So I'll be surprised
if it hits the small, then an Oracle database piece of code. Well, do you, I reckon you don't have
that many, sort of, committers to something called Oracle, right? No, but it hasn't been around
longer than Linux. Well, that's true. For some reason or another? Yeah. Well, by the way,
we're welcome to the closed source review podcast.
Oh, yes, we are discussing closed source of approach. You have to have some perspective,
right? For these things. Oh, absolutely. And that case, how come you know how many lines of
code are in Oracle? Well, it's an interesting fact if you compare, say, an open source piece of
code like this with an Oracle or the first question. Very nature of Oracle is that it's not
open source. So yeah, I mean, if somebody tells you Oracle has about what, 20, 20,
million, lots of code, you simply have to take the word for it because it can approve it.
No, yes, maybe you see my point point. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So if Oracle is lying,
tough luck. Yeah, well, I mean, anyway, it doesn't really matter. Maybe it's only a few thousand
lines. Obviously being bulky and stuff. Maybe it's just a few thousand lines of code
and the rest is marketing fluff. Hmm, you never know. Yeah. So it makes you wonder,
though, why does an operating system need that many lines of code, right?
If you take a look at the, well, at least when I did it, I'm off to the point.
Well, I'm in good shoes over in it. Oh, no, here we go again. Dear listeners,
there has been an ongoing discussion between the hosts of Linux and Lars about the viability of
go-to's in certain code bases or not. At the point that I try to make here is that in us,
let us use cases. Yes, you can use go to Martin apparently coming from a list or a closure
background totally disagrees. So if you have thoughts on this, the email address is back at
linuxinloss.eu. Please share your views. You'll have to discuss one show.
You're listening, Claudia. Yeah, we appreciate it. Yeah, more on the review of
Claudius review later. Okay, sorry, we were discussing, yes, sorry, going back to the kernel.
The last time, yes, the last time I looked at it, the bulk of the code, from a K-lock perspective,
was actually device drivers. That is the reason why Linux is so big because you can run it
on a single chip system as like an SLC, it's a smart chip processor, sorry, right up to the
mainframe. All these devices, all these all these all these gadgets have different devices.
For example, the mainframe still has an architecture called channel processor attached to it,
special instructions that on all the rest of it, you have a million GPUs out there
as in graphical processing units that want drivers. You have a hand, a bulk load of Wi-Fi
driver of Wi-Fi chips, never mind the DSP and the embedded world. All of them need actually device
drivers. The ARM folks have done the decent thing, they invented something called DST,
which is something device system tree or something. Essentially, it's a
definition language inside the kernel for device drivers like
DMA mappings, port mappings, and other characteristics. The idea is basically not to re-write
device drivers every time you need in your device drivers, but rather putting an architecture
into place that can be modified with very little effort. That was the overall idea behind
something called the device system tree or whatever it stands for. Actually, I think there's
even a compiler inside the kernel that takes the DST description and then generates the appropriate
instructions or mappings on the fly. It needs to say that helps a lot with porting
the little kernel to devices with that sort of architecture. Okay, so DST doesn't stand for
dark side tech. As in the serial of the DST. I see. More on that later. Yes. Okay. Very good.
Is there anything else worth discussing at this moment? Maybe even beyond 5.7.
Sorry, what are you talking about? What are you talking about now?
News. Just turn on the news. Oh, news news. Yes. I noticed that the code of the corona app is
actually on the GitHub. As you may or may not know, the German government decided to
task some C-league players by the name of SAP and German telecom with the development of
a corona app that is able to detect corona outlets within your... That's a corona outlet.
An outlet basically where you can buy the beer. Okay. Okay.
Europe, if you're listening, you may... Sorry, European, what's the word I'm looking for?
Not cartel, but rather competitive agencies. Yeah, exactly. Competition regulators.
That's the word I'm looking for. Yes, if you're listening, you may want to get in touch
with the app producers to ensure that they're also considered a high-necking,
cart-spurk, roach, Guinness, and whatever else comes to mind here because just doing it for corona,
which is, by the way, in a Mexican beer, not even coming from Europe, maybe a blatant
violation of competitive landscape. Yes, exactly. And whilst you're listening, brewers of the above,
don't forget the sponsoring opportunity. Indeed. And yes, we don't do apps, but we have beautiful
podcasts called Linux, it laws. Excellent. Okay, coming back, no jokes aside. And the idea, of course,
is the idea of courses, because the German taxpayers funding this, that you eventually put the code
on... That you eventually put the code on GitHub. And that's exactly what happened. So for those...
To any good. I haven't checked it out, to be honest with you. The idea is to have a cross-platform app
running on iOS as well as Android that will implement George Orwell's wildest dreams, essentially,
meaning that you have now full traceability, of course, anonymized, if you will,
because that was one of the great marketing tech lines of this app with his corona stuff.
The idea is, especially, you install the app on your phone, it then uses something called
Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE, to pick up similar smartphones with the app installed as well,
and then tracks these contacts, rather. Should one of the other smartphones then be
long to an owner that registers as positive with regards to the overall infection situation,
you are then being notified that within a certain amount of time, you were in contact with that person.
Travel is basically... It doesn't give you the phone number, it doesn't give you the name,
so it just essentially tells you that... It's done a follow-up there that you have to get
yourself tested in Germany. It's not a quad though, but the big worry here is that, of course,
smartphones are not anonymous. A smartphone has something called a SIM card in it,
and each SIM card has a unique identifier, which is not the phone number exactly.
And that information, of course, is accessible via the operating system and also via the app.
It requires, depending on your operating system, certain permissions,
but if you don't... I reckon...
Oh, you may still not install it in the first place then, right?
Exactly.
So with that sort of technology, as I said,
George Orwell's Wildest Dreams have come true, because,
okay, Google tracks you if you're using maps and don't turn the location service off.
But here, you are not just being tracked with regards to, you are about,
you're also being tracked with whom you were in contact.
That's quite handy for most reasons.
Indeed, especially if you are a government entity,
not concerned with the public health, but rather some much more shady business.
And obviously, the shady people are not going to use this app as a gutter point.
Shady people, if you're listening out there, you do not install this app.
Just don't.
Never mind Corona, Hinecone,
Groltkarsburg, just forget about the app.
You don't want to do this.
By the way, I wouldn't advise you on smartphones here, feature phones,
with the throwaway SIM are much more useful in this context,
because after you simply throw away the SIM, no big deal.
So, I heard anyway.
And the phone, yep.
But if you're in an episode in your country, you can also not buy phones without ID.
Well, I think there's, if you read, there's the little comment to register,
even if you're using a prepaid service, but are reckoned for those people who are listening,
who are slightly more on the note, I'm sure you also know how to get the
throw out this requirement.
Pretty bunch, yeah.
The Shady people, exactly.
So, there's one thing remaining.
We're going to do the POX.
And before this, we have a review of Cloud Yous review, just to fill in the listeners,
somebody called Cloud You, what's the second name again?
So, Cloud Youmeranda, if you're listening, this is for you.
Come here.
Bene, it's you.
Bene, have you heard about Cloud You or what's next step on some podcasts?
Hey, did I wait?
Spilled beans about next step, including it's spelling.
Barkatrojai, you serious?
It is our in the open on some podcasts called Hacker Public Radio or something.
So, the whole world knows that next step is not the realy or lowercase?
You name it.
This is big and it's immediate and tension.
Let me get in touch with the excuses.
Somewhere in the more shady parts of Manhattan's Hell Kitchen,
there's a small nondescript building hosting the Frattanella de Correzione,
or the Brotherhood of Correction.
The Brotherhood is the SWAT team, local chapters of the Adanageta,
the Corsair Nostra, American mobs, or the Aminians call to rescue,
to do the heavy lifting.
Think of it like the Delta Force, the Navy SEALs, ISIS,
and other organizations with a special focus all rolled into one.
But much more professional.
On a good day or on a bad day, you really don't want to upset them
as a long and painful death would be considered the easy way out.
Sicily got in touch, apparently there's a spot of bother.
What's the trouble?
Apparently somebody revealed the truth about next step's original spelling.
Like, or lowercase?
No, the original spelling.
Like, the one in the book written by the one who must not be named?
Exactly, in public.
You mean even on Wikipedia and such?
Let me check.
It's through indeed.
That's our cluster of focus.
Whoever did this must have traveled back in time and changed this in all the wrong places.
This is bad news, and it is written in the terms of old
that the name with the original capitalization when uttered aloud
would unleash the beast and then no words.
Pray so.
This is way beyond our pay grade.
This goes for special attention by the chaps.
You mean the first order?
No, rather the cleaning crew behind them.
Somewhere on the planet on the outer ring of the southern crap Nebula,
there are the headquarters of the Eriskrat,
a race originally bred by the first order,
the Eriskrats are a species of transgalactic
interdimensional mercenaries with a prime objective,
setting things right,
for whoever has the most convincing arguments.
Most of the time, this means galactic credits.
A lot of galactic credits.
Think of them as Mandalorians with an attitude.
Oh...
For the benefit of those few listeners not familiar with Eriskratian,
we provided a version of the following dialogue between Lew and Thrat
and Nanag, two of the best consultants,
The RS CRAT have to offer and normally only booked for special assignments.
A system soul just got in touch looking for a quote for a contract for something important.
Something about an operating system called Next Step.
The one when spoken out aloud with the wrong capitalization can destroy worlds and galaxies and cause minor havoc.
That seems to be the one. The contract is for a single though.
A single system, a single star or a single planet?
No, single being.
What? They didn't get the memo.
Like all other big organizations, the RS CRATs recently had to undergo a so-called reorganization
where being counter most of the time are commonly known as a controller in other civilizations.
It had quarters came to the conclusion that the margin on destroying anything smaller than a plant wasn't cutting it
in the light of the prevailing expense structures like building and maintaining death stars, low orbit, iron colliders etc.
And even ending a planet carried a hefty surcharge according to the latest price list, you get the picture.
Apparently not what should we do.
Tell them that we cannot make an exception.
Either the whole system goes on nothing at all.
We have to let this slip. Otherwise the word will get around that we are still the cheapest which we used to be.
Shortly afterwards in one of the bigger cities on the eastern coast of a continent in the northern hemisphere
of a third planet from the star of a system called Sol.
The chap's got back in touch. Apparently they sent a new price list which we never got.
Interstellar mails still sucks.
Bummer, what should we do?
They will only destroy a whole planet at a price. It gets cheaper if we want a whole star system gone.
Are you serious? This won't watch with the dawn.
We can't send them a local.
Connor comes to mind, but he just sent a personal time off request.
His third grade cousins cat just got kittens and he has to get a present for the questioning.
Are you joking?
No, the cats are due, so he can't cut corners.
Fuck it then. This is serious. This sort of is out themselves.
The brotherhood just rang. The deal is off.
They cannot send somebody to sort this out. Apparently it's too expensive to get the pros in on this.
Are you serious? The word is going to end and the quibbling about though.
So it seems.
What's the servitor up these days? Can't the heat take a care of this?
No, we haven't heard from him in ages. Apparently he's busy writing computers software or something.
And I can't await that.
Doesn't look like it has some Amish websites really lost the stuff.
You mean the speedy access to adult entertainment?
That's the one.
This is Nuxilars. A podcast on topics around free and open source software.
Any associated contraband, communism, the revolution in general, and whatever else, fans is ethical.

So Martin, what do you make of this review of the review?
I'm going to be put it to be correct here. I think it was very constructive.
I don't know. I applaud you before this goes totally the wrong way.
Don't get me wrong. Just us taking the piss. This is totally normal. This is what we do as links in laws.
Your comments and your and your feedback is appreciated. And you just say that goes for any of the listeners.
We do value feedback. Sometimes we may reserve the right to use some artistic freedom here, as we did just with the kind of sketch here that we just did about Claudius review.
But as I said, your reviews, your feedback is appreciated.
So if we don't have any more feedback, yeah, thank you, Claudio. If you're coming from an Italian background, multi-gratis and your if not, thank you very much anyway.
And we look forward to more of this kind. We may reserve the right not to take the piss in this case. Just in case.
Okay. Before we roll this up, I think there's still the pox to do. So Martin, watch your pox.
Oh my god. Yes.
Pox. Oh my god. I do that. I have a lot of anti pox.
We come to that in a minute.
Okay. If Martin draws a blank here, my pox is actually a TV series called California.
I checked this out again recently. I think it dates back up.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
This describes the exploits, the exploits rather off.
And now, I'm basically, Martin, you have to help me out here. I'm pretty bad at actor and a actor names.
X files. David, do you have something like this?
Yeah. That sounds about right.
It describes the exploits of him exactly.
Being a writer for a TV show, among other things, and then heavily into kind of family life, drugs, alcohol.
The whole thing reminded me very much of fucked totem or even barfly or Hollywood done by a guy called Copsky.
The whole TV series has a somewhat pokovski and touch to it, I think.
So if you check it out, you will find the links in the show.
You will find the link in the show notes, get it from your video outlet or streaming service of choice.
At least a couple of, like, at least a couple of years, I think they did, but they did about six, six seasons or something like this worth watching.
Okay.
And of course, you have our beloved Pamela at London, starring this too.
So any Pamela at London fans, this is something you don't want to miss.
I know I wouldn't call myself Pamela at London fans.
If she's just a great actress, that's all.
But only to your pigs.
I'm sorry, pox of the week right now.
Yes.
Yeah, so it ties in with the antipox.
But yeah, it is for me.
It is a website called wiki.rschlilux.org, which.
Who recommended that to you?
I'll just check in there.
Somebody, you know, I'm taking support of my.
I thought I'd take it out.
Okay, maybe some random arch package maintain recommended to you.
That was a very large wiki.
Fair enough.
It kind of makes sense.
But yeah, now it's, it's quite well written and very informative all in one place.
Should you?
Very good.
If you're sort of technically inclined like Martin is.
Find out a basics of linux pieces of architecture.
Like hybrid hills.
Which brings me on to the pox of the week, which is.
That was the box of the week.
You mean the antipox.
Antipox.
Yes.
Well, it's easy now.
So it's heavy.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
A box stands of course for a pick of the weeks or a picks of the week.
It should be important.
Well, don't worry about it.
No, it's just shorter.
And of course, that unfortunately, I didn't, I didn't send a memo about this, but forever,
but apparently you didn't, you didn't get this.
Uh, this, this term was coined while you were out of office.
As in, um, not particularly in the podcast for that, for that single episode.
And the antipox, of course, is something you want to forget very quickly.
Uh, I just have a general device for spices that the bottom of the four that you generally despise.
Exactly.
So let me give you an example strawberry ice cream would be a pox.
Whereas, um, yeah, no beer would be a pox to wear as a beer gone off would be an antipox.
Yeah.
Um, awesome.
Um, already melted strawberry ice cream in the gutter would be an antipox.
That's something.
I see.
And what floor do you want?
You get the drift.
Uh, third, I think I can't recall.
Anyway, that's a matter.
Okay, um, let me guess.
Yeah, antipox or two weeks is something called HOS?
Yes, it's kind of related to that.
I mean, it's, it's a little bit strong.
It's, it's not that bad, but, um, yeah.
It is as with anything.
Property put some messy wrappers around it and confuse everybody.
So.
Yeah.
That was my antipox.
And it's your HOS being a, uh, a router switch OS.
Invent, we're not invented running on ubiquity network.
For those people who, um, bought similar ubiquity,
you'd be quite a kid like Martin did.
Uh, and want to get into kind of doing ice, providing ISP service for the neighbors on the site.
That sort of thing.
Or I just kind of concerned that there, um,
20-part router doesn't fit the bill anymore.
Yes, ubiquity does very, that does very serious get.
In case, uh, you cover such as you're not like Martin, you're not impressed.
There is actually, and you will, and you will find the link of the show notes.
There is the ability to install Debian, Debian packages for ubiquity.
So you can complement the edge as user land with native Debian packages.
Because this is something that probably not that many people know.
Mips.
And this is basically what the, what the ubiquity device devices use.
Is a supported architecture for Debian similar to arm or Intel.
So you can install native Mips based packages on your HOS device.
That, of course, gives you the advantage of not having to deal exclusively with this crappy user land as, as offered by HOS.
If I am not completely mistaken.
Did you notice bruises here?
No, no, no, no.
Okay.
Yes.
Cut.
Okay.
Yes.
But, and let's go to let's get on with the next episode.
We would like to think that it is correct for sponsoring this episode of Linux and laws.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Bene.
Bene. Have you heard about Claudio?
He wrote that next step on podcast.
He did the water.
Spilled beans about next step.
Including it's spelling.
I think it's a bit tricky to don't tell him.
Okay.
Oh, how do you pronounce it?
Bro, yeah, just roll the art.
That's important.
It is out in the open on some podcast.
Called Hacker Public.
Called Hacker Public Radio.
That begins to be first.
On some podcast they called Hacker Public Radio or something.
So the whole world knows that next step is not really a law case.
You name it.
This is big and needs immediate attention.
Let me get in touch with the issues.
Okay.
Italian is easy when you get in it.
Do you have some Vino and Russell?
No, I'm on the tea still.
Too bad.
Should we try the, should we try the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you're come up to.
Okay.
Hang on.
Should we do, should we do with the, I should record the Italian first.
It's up, it's really up to you.
Ah, it's probably a good idea.
Yeah, stick with the Italian.
But as I said, please take it down.
I think that was like you over the top.
No, no, no, no.
It might need to go.
No, it's too much.
What?
It's just a problem.
It's not really partying now.
Okay, rolling.
Okay, I keep rolling.
I mean, we can always edit this out later.
So, no worries.
Okay.
Should we do a dry run for the, for the New Yorker bunch?
Yeah.
Ah, Russian, Russian.
Say something, Russian.
That's true.
Yeah.
It's pretty much like Italian.
That's true.
Yeah.
Oh, you're darker.
If you get mad.
That's deep.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, it can be American.
I mean, don't worry about it.
So, that's okay.
Okay.
Sicily got in touch.
Apparently, there's a spot of bother.
Oh, it's a trouble.
Let's more.
Well, maybe a little more realistic.
Sicily.
Shit.
Sicily got in touch.
Carry on with it.
It's not in.
No powering.
No powering.
It's not in.
Okay.
Um, okay.
Sicily got in touch.
Apparently, there's a spot of bother.
Sorry.
Again.
Okay.
Ronin.
No.
Rather the cleaning crew behind him.
Oh fucking hell.
What?
What?
What to eat then?
He stuffed the ricotta.
Cut, cut, cut.
That wasn't at the artistic amendment to be tired of.
What are you on about?
Have you had it something?
