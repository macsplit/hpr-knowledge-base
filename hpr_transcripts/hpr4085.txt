This is Hacker Public Radio episode 4,085 for Friday the 29th of March 2024.
Today's show is entitled, Android User Land Google Assistant GPT.
It is hosted by Operator, and is about 32 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is Operator tells you how to get past no ADB and blocking of 3rd party APKS.
You are listening to a show from the Reserve Q. We are airing it now because we had free
slots that were not filled.
This is a community project that needs listeners to contribute shows in order to survive.
Please consider recording a show for Hacker Public Radio.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to another episode of Hacker Public Radio with your host, Operator.
Today we are talking about new Android phone and how I've set it up and how it's different
than my last one.
So, we are going to be talking about kind of not jail breaking, but being able to run
any application you want on a at least Android device and then also how I'm handling
Google Assistant now using Chat GPT.
So if you want a better Google Assistant or if you want to have complete control over
your entire device or have basically a micro computer inside of your Android computer,
your Android phone, listen up.
So first thing to talk about is background.
The old setup we have with work was two profile setups.
So the first one was the like system profile zero or whatever and then I think it was profile
nine was my personal profile and the idea is that the work in the personal or separate
and then you could have apps on each one and whatever you could you could manage the app
stores separately and essentially completely close out in theory all the tasks for your
work profile when your personal wasn't on or when you're not working you can turn off
the work profile and that will kill all the apps for the work profile and I from what
I can tell they actually did work so I had to log back into stuff after a weekend or
whatever.
So anyways, that's how it was set up before.
It was kind of weird the way we had email was through exchange but it was a weird exchange
Google thing so Gmail client was my client for our directory outlook.
So everything was kind of broken outlook was the previous thing and then I guess they
were locking things down and decided to go this route and try to see if it would work
and it really didn't work.
So they moved back to a different model where you just have one profile and there's no
ADB debugging for Android and there's also no third party APKs along with all the other
security profile stuff like locking standards and stuff like that so first things first
that limits a lot of what you can do if you can't do ADB then there's a lot of stuff you
can't do with the phone as far as enhancements getting things what you want.
You think for third party applications if you can't start install third party APK things
start get to get complicated or you start getting jailed into that ecosystem of Android.
So I start to think about what can I do chances are I tried to do some silly stuff like load
APK through another app that was already installed so you have some janky work app and maybe
you can man the middle of some kind of method in which to execute arbitrary code through
your work app and gain like system level access.
So the idea would be and I still haven't done any research on this and I'm not a Android
Pintester by any means but the idea would be to get hold of one of those work applications
expect that traffic debug get understand how to get in between it and find a way to get
to the information so if there's no SSL at some point that's an easy way to get out but
even there I think a third party app can't install third party apps unless it's enabled
in the backend so you'd have to basically compromise like mass 360 or something and that's
probably not going to happen so I look at that and said there's no way I'm going to be
able to find some like Oday with you know and the place or mass 360 or something so I
gave up on that and said okay what else can I do I know I have arbitrary code execution
I know I can execute whatever I want on this device because it's just inherently how
it's set up there's no application why listing I can run whatever app I want it just
so happens that the apps that I can run are in as closed ecosystem but that's not to
say I can't create you know a shell script and run that or create some other arbitrary
code somewhere on the system and execute stuff so then I start talking about the thinking
about oh well I know they have like the external and the whatever they call the emulators
or whatever terminal emulators for Android let me just fire one of those up and see if
I can get a like a tabian you know install going and have a terminal and I can get everything
I need from there and I don't remember the name of it but that's what I had used before
but it's a popular terminal and you can have like devian like packages and I started to
mess with that and they kept warning me that it was old and then it used to be updated
and you can't do this can't do that it was all kind of old and the lap date and it said
oh we'll use a new version that's not on the play store well that's not an option for
me because again right we can't install through pretty applications so started to back
up and say okay well now that I sort of have arbitrary code execution what can I look
and I knew there was way back an APK on the app store they could let you install different
distributions and run you know other distros like Cali or whatever that's you know what I
wonder what the scene looks like now for that it's probably kind of fleshed out and chits and
actually this so there's a app on the app store for Android called while I don't remember the name
it is called like my notes here oh it's on a hacking list user land so user land is basically
a way to start up other distributions within Android they call it a let's see they don't even
just explain what it is here but anyways it's a way to run several different distributions
within Android and there's other ones like you know any letters that will let you do same type of
thing so your options here are within user land let me bring it up here on my phone here
Alpine arch devian kelly bunch of Firefox get idle will Python idle I guess shell VS code somehow
thunderbird I guess VS codes through whatever you know whatever you can run mono which you can run
windows you know BLLs or VB whatever code inside the Linux thunderbird games adventures work
kind of a couple math things interestingly gimp inkscape and leapray office so you can pretty
much install whatever you want once you get one of these going so my intention was to create like
a devian devian instance and basically use that to launch whatever I wanted my main requirement
and my only requirement so far on Android at least has been that I would like to download youtube
videos and there's no way to do that without a third party ABK or a command line version of youtube
or youtube downloader whatever so that's why I realized I can use this whole full blown devian
image essentially to do whatever I want now I will say I would probably just stay in the command
line the UI for me at least seemed pretty crashy I think a minimalist UI might be an option there
but as soon as you start updating apps and installing things it can get weird because it tries
to do you know like kernel level stuff and it will end up breaking the environment so you have to
be careful with what you install and then reboot check to see if still everything still works then
if you have issues you know you get the kind of rollback let's figure out how to do the
speed dependency structure works and work around those different dependencies but the idea there is
now I have a full blown devian UI that I can click around with at least for a little bit
and I can run youtube vl and command line if I want to download a youtube video on my phone so
that's how I handled that and it's quite interesting I actually plugged it into the computer
plugged it into a docking station and was able to use my keyboard mouse screen actually not a
docking station but I plugged it directly into the hdmi and then I plugged the
actually there's a cable you can get it's a usbc to usb and hdmi in charge port so they use
them for Nintendo switches there's a little mini a dongle so the inputs usbc the output is
several usb ports and hdmi and charge port so you can charge it you can plug keyboard and mouse
into it and then you can plug hdmi into it so basically turns your phone into a portable
workstation which I'm we're not too far off from having that I would say you know if we could
get off the train of having windows boxes it would actually be viable but it's never going to happen
when windows owns the ecosystem but you can essentially run plug your phone into a you know
keyboard mouse monitor and do whatever you need to do uh nowadays um everything's on the web
anyways so who cares but anyways guys yeah I'm jotting a lot here because of the water
it's been sitting here for god knows how long anyways um drink more water so we have basically
an entire devian environment we do whatever we want to do we're good there uh the second piece
I was missing is um I wanted to talk about is really weather um and weather apps and all the
garbage that comes along with it I like weather underground but I've never really liked having a
weather app because weather is dumb and it's free and there's a million places to get the weather
why do I have to you know be bombarded by ads or you know annoyed by a crappy UI whatever so I think
I asked or looked on Reddit or asked uh uh chat GPT or kaji at this point which I don't think I've
done one on kaji and I need to add that in here let me see uh g.com there's going to be a lot of
stuff packed in here too um so um it they call this widget a five w i d g e t i f y um it's like
widget a five um so basically it makes a webpage a widget on your desktop and essentially what I did
was um at the national service radar um they have like a compressed version or like a
cell cellular version um I think it's called like when you go in there you can click print or
something like that when it will show you like a printable version of of the radar and things
like that so you can mess around with the UI um especially from your phone to it from your phone
and it will give you different UI options um but what I have here is um a probably little a little
square one two three I mean I use a different um I use no by the kids me more icons on the desktop
but I have a little block here with the radar and that shows me the radar um I can see through
the rain patch coming whatever uh exactly where my coordinates are and then we'll have that
a little bit I have another widget if I did tells me the the weather for the day for the week
so it's like today, tonight, Friday, Friday night um today is obviously Thursday um and so
it doesn't require an app it doesn't well it does require the widget if I have which apparently
has ads but unless you go into the settings of the application um or like configure you know the
the the the widget itself um you're not going to see any ads so it's it's very um it's very
too I can't even actually get to the ads I don't even know how to get to um get to the I think
that's under configure once you configure something there might be ads in here I don't even know
so yeah there's I think there's ads in the configuration banners or whatever
so anyways that's how I've got weather without having to have a weather app um I use the Nova
desktop thing I paid for the premium version um so far everything is free except for um Nova
gives you some uh it's like backing up your um backing up your current configuration with Nova
and then and then changing the way the essentially the launcher works that's that's what we're
replacing here um and pretty much standard stuff I've already talked about um there is a
I have a Firefox nightly and you can enable developer mode and then you can um create your own
developer plugin sets that will work pretty much on anything so I have a developer plugin set
set to my own uh plugin set and you just need the ID to it so I um there's it's on my YouTube
if I remember I'll try to make a video no pet um video for Firefox no ads so it's sponsor block
and um the adblocker the add on black custom uh lit number I'm using is 11335506 and the name of it
is block so that's the only thing you need to know is install developer um Firefox um click
click click click to like about section or the icon and the about and it'll unlock developer and
you can go in there and add a custom ad on collection and that will have all of a sudden you get
easily all right so um so we've got no ads with YouTube player using Firefox because there's
no third party you know YouTube players you can load up because they're so we've got no ads
with YouTube no ads uh we have the ability to download YouTube videos or any video for that
matter through or do whatever we want at all and it's also importantly enough you can dub combine
user land with a VPN and get basically an entire invisible uh instance of your setup um
uh essentially invisible and without some kind of forensics uh to to to work or anybody uh trying
to you know its vector traffic or whatever um the only drawback there is that you would um
you know the files would be playing text on the system itself but you could probably employ
some kind of um encryption uh mounting where you're storing the data and encrypted drive within
then the the virtual machine so that gets a little tacky if it sits there and crash it all the
time but there are options for you know you could do Malik uh I love you can you quit that tire
excuse me it's hard disk but anyways so we've got YouTube no ads we've got YouTube downloaders um
everything else is pretty standard now we're 16 minutes in and we're going to talk about
tasker and replacing Google Assistant with not a piece of garbage the requirements are are at least
basically five dollars worth of tasker plugins and I will say tasker is for
it's kind of hacky I've used them before I tried to use it for Google voice apparently you can
use it for Google but again I think you have to have USD usb debugging to to talk to
Google voice like natively um there's a lot of SMS things you can call SMS natively
to do things in Android but uh Google voice is not an SMS client and SMS application it's a
SMS proxy so it's not used like an SMS application in your traditional sense going over the cellular
network so there's a translation there so any kind of application that has to do with SMS or anything
trying to manage Google voice or calls or anything it's kind of hacky with Google voice so that's
kind of my main problem but if you have standard SMS you can actually do all kinds of crazy stuff
with standard SMS SMS accessibility or whatever SMS app you have you can hijack all that stuff
so anyways we have some requirements first which I'll mention
again is tasker and tasker has been around forever um it's got an interesting UI it's um I would say
you know what ends up happening is that you see a plugin for tasker that does what you probably
think you might want to do and then you pay all the money to unlock all the things to get it to do
what you wanted to do and then it sort of ends up doing what you want to do but it's clunky in some
way whereas you know you have to like for for example when mine got squirrely out of reboot and like
do you know probably spend a minute to set up the to make sure everything was running it might be
like a battery optimization thing that I'm missing somewhere but it seems to be kind of clunky so
anyways anytime I've ever done anything with tasker it's always been like a hacky clunky thing but
as a proof of concept and to see what we're going to see sooner rather than later um I have replaced
the google assistant with um trash apt essentially your gpt4 turbo and um that's kind of how it's
set up now so um there's not really any notes around that I'll add the gpt section add how to
use gpt4 turbo um you know I've been using turbo instead of um gpt4 because it is wildly
cheaper um gpt4 is too big expensive um gpt4 turbo is reasonable and it's it's just almost as good
as far as I can tell um less wordy actually then then gpt4 so anyways um the first kind of
application one install install there's a tasker essentially a tasker uh opens source public
repository of tasker apps and profiles and so the first thing I searched was a hey google or
uh chatypt and when I searched for that there was one called hey google chatypt now I will see if I
can go over kind of the record so the website is tasker.net and then you go to um hey google
chatypt or you just type in chatypt and you'll get hey google chatypt let me turn off all my
ad blockers here I'm not seeing the rest of the content
I don't don't see it
anyways um the the requirements for this and I'll tell you here in a second sorry
it doesn't show up correctly with the browser
okay um let's take a little i-frame they put in here so it replaces the hey google chatypt
tasker.com public thing replace google assistant with chatypt make sure to carefully read the
instructions below and also the instructions of the other mentioned projects now there's
there's several pieces of this there is chatypt um there's chatypt
task caller and there's hey google command intercept um and then there's auto input which I think
get that's a plugin yet to pay for so there's like I said it's like $5 to set up and you also need
to open API key um I have access to chatypt 4 turbo I think they're giving it all away now so
it used to be just chatypt like gpt 3.5 with the open API access I think they just gave it
just give it all away but that takes about a month um you go in a request access to gpt 4 and
they give it to you but I think they give it to everybody now I don't know how it works but
if you sign up for open AI they'll give you API key and then you look for how to request access
to gpt 4 or they probably already have it just by default now so anyways um the first part is
getting the plugins installed and setup make sure each application having to do with tasker is
set to um not optimize and be always running if you don't want battery optimization or anything
like that running when it's trying to do stuff um I haven't had a glitch out on me too much I
use it for like three days and then I glitched out and I just fixed it this morning or last night
and it seems to be working okay I'm having a bit of a problem with the personalities don't seem
to work right and I don't know if I don't have the right prompt or something but
so that's some of what's going on so the import the haygoogle command intercept this basically
this project allows you to get google system commands to tasker so somehow it's able to hook
the haygoogle call the call and then um you can define whether you want it to take it over
entirely which you don't want um or you can have it a keyword setup for it so it can be
h google um and then when you say the keyword which I've defined as orange it will do whatever it
is you need to do so here's I'll do a quick example hey google and of course it's not working so
hey google orange tell me a joke about how bad google assistant is
it's very quick as far as like don't we like to hang out with google assistant parties
because whenever we ask you to tell a joke it just google's one
yeah so that's an example of a response from chatchypt for a google assistant using the
code word orange so it's h google orange quickly followed by what you want to ask chatchypt
it's not a two-way conversation it's a single whatever if you want to have a conversation with it
then you just go to the UI and you say you know you click on the UI and say I want to start a
conversation you can go back and forth with it so that's kind of interesting um I have used it
I used it a couple times to um ask quick questions so like for example if I want to know how to do
a function of our sim spunk sim and say hey how do I remove duplicates or whatever it was I was asking
it and instead of having to search for it kaji not google k agi.com um I I was I was able to get
the response from the phone and not have to stop what I was doing um to like search for an easy
answer to something that is google assistant is not that it can't do anything smart um and I'm
not sure how the open API works but I'm pretty sure it has web access but not have to check that um
I'm actually we can do that right now so hey google orange tell me any information security news
related to today. You might take a minute for that one. Sorry I currently don't have the ability
to fetch live news data. Okay. I recommend using news sites or search engines for the most
interesting things. So I actually want to develop um I want to create uh rewrite the chat
gbt port and make it use kaji because kaji has kaji search or kaji fast gbt um so I think fast
gbt is free right now the kaji is like 200 something a month or sorry a year um basically the same price
of chat gbt or gbt plus but it's um all kaji and all that so anyways um I won't do a thing on kaji
I'll do a thing it deserves its own thing. Tasker deserves its own thing okay and also um
user land all deserves its own thing but I'm bundling it into two different ones and we're 30 minutes
now so if you're still with me um yeah I appreciate you sticking around so I've showed you a couple
of examples it does not have web access which that makes sense because you're talking directly to
the model you're not it doesn't include search um but there probably might be easy ways to do that
to just change the the get request because essentially an api request um and I'm sure I can change
the open api request to actually use web stuff web search um but that might be just a part of plus
I don't know so anyways um so that's kind of an easy way to get our our our replace our assistant
with something that's actually useful um again it would be nice to have web site access but this
is just to give you an idea of kind of what's coming with you know assistance and getting them
actually do something useful so I hope to find if I can't find something for a chat GPT
web to give me you know AI plus search is what you want if I can't get that with um
chat GPT just by changing their quest I will try and rewrite tasker to use um kaji because
essentially all the inputs are there like all I have to do is change up the URL and api key um more or
less so I can look at the traffic going across uh using jane burying my project on my github look
at the traffic going across the network when I'm doing the request in response and I can see what's
getting sent to through the plugin and find that code replace it with my own urls and um my own api
keys and use kaji for that input on their tasker dot com tasker net dot com open public thing
I'm I heard the word not yet for android kaji assistant um I'm assuming there's an android
web based AI assistant coming soon that's AI in search but I've been google free for two three
months now um that's a different episode entirely I could do I'm do a whole thing on it and there's
stuff kaji haven't even messed with yet um but anyways it's been what 40 minutes something like that
not so long 30 minutes um I'll let you guys go but if you're interested in being on the
bleeding edge of replacing google assistant with something useful um definitely try it out
test it out it's like five bucks and then like maybe like another five bucks for open api
um like open api stuff I've used it I don't know how many times and I've only spent like three
dollars across open a open AI and kaji so I've got like you know 10 bucks and you know five bucks
of kaji and five bucks and open api I've hardly used any of it um it's pretty much it
so this is kind of how you get control over your device um even saw user land
um and there's not really much else I need um from a you know uh requirements perspective um the
glycolic thing is I use for for managing the audio it's called gl y c o x and it's a compressor
and and limiter and equalizer for android so you can mess with the audio of your headphones
do a bass boost or um bass this boost to sound coming out because my car setup is pretty bad
so I have to boost the sound as loud as I go to get any audio out of the car system that I
set up so anyways hope it appreciates just sit up feel free to have any questions
if you know of any um AI search replacements assistance for android please let me know
I would pay $30 a month for you know AI search AI plus search for android voice based
I'm working on eventually maybe within a year or two when the stuff gets easier I'll have my own
AI voice copy voice clone and then I'll use that with my own fine tune model based on my text
messages and my emails and that will act more like me um yeah so uh also a bonus there's the
Myers-Briggs personality test which is you know they've say it's all but what's called MBTI
it's a personality test and there's like three letters um and I'm an ENFJ that's echo Nancy Fox
uh what it's what whatever J is juice um Juliet and then my tri-type
integram is 729 um so you can say you can make AI a little bit more like you especially at
least with CHEP GBT you can say hey in the personality you know my district personality of ENFJ
and a tri-type integram 729 answer this question or deal with this problem or start a conversation
with me um and maybe I'll do one specifically on AI usage um let me add that I have a crap ton of
test code GPT that I've done that one so AI usage um stuff like professor synapse
kaji maybe I'll think that make that all part of kaji because the powerful part of kaji is the AI
so maybe maybe that'll be kaji in AI usage because we've talked about I've heard talking about AI
but I've never heard anybody use it outside of creating an automated you know uh an automated
episode HPR or something anyways I'll let she all go um probably gonna do one on resumes to
Jesus um I'm doing resume updating uh resume uh uh I'm using AI to help write resumes still like that
so I'll do one on that there should be a little uh fair amount more episodes coming so if you
don't like to hear my voice, or if you do like to hear my voice, and have any constructive
criticism to say, hey, you know, you're too rambly, or you say, and an um too much, or can
you slow down? Can you speed up? Can you focus more on this thing? Any feedback would be great.
Try not to yawn, but that's what ends up happen when you start talking. Your vocal chords
get tired, and then it makes you yawn. So anyways, appreciate it. You all have a good time,
and stay frosty. Take it easy.
