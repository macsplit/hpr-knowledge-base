FOR THEY manage, they'll not have enough money because they don't need any.
You have nobody and I'm trying to look him up.
We're all not making any demands for him to do us something empty.
Welcome to this week's Operator Linux user group that is October 23rd, 2008.
How are we doing?
Great.
Just fine.
Yes, fine.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Good.
So starting our two minutes of fame.
Who starts first?
Not you.
So I'll start first.
Thank you for having me here.
Thank you for having me here.
Can you yell because there's a microphone over there?
I haven't done a whole lot other than I just played a little bit around the coffee.
That's great and really good.
You played with what?
Comkey.
Comkey.
Yes.
And I was amazed at how easy it is to set up.
I learned that you can actually, you can direct Comkey to a console.
Yes.
I've seen articles like that.
I didn't try that.
All right.
I run Comkey on this right here.
It's always up.
It's just displayed on my stats.
You just take generic text file you put down there.
You just adjust a little bit in the RAM right away and run it getting all the stats out of it.
That's not just going to be bad.
So I played it on that.
So how does that going to be playing around with a box called the main network?
The main network, maybe.
Or the main network.
The popcorn network?
Yeah.
Something I'm moving.
Very close.
It is a sort of like a nipped TV box with no hard drive.
And basically, it's a thin piece of sliced box that you put on your home and your payment center with it.
You get all my outputs and other power outputs.
But it connects to a remote computer somewhere on your network.
And pulls the information out there of the stream.
I think you use it video and stuff like that.
And it also looks up to certain websites.
It's like you buy it.
Yeah.
It's all solid state.
You hook it up.
It's already.
All the software is on there already.
You can't add an internal hard drive if you want to.
Where do you get this?
Just take a popcorn hour on the web.
Is it an open source?
What's that?
Is it open source?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
You get a mirror on the same thing and you can hit it.
Yes.
What was that?
Neuros?
Neuros.
It was exactly what the door was.
Yes.
Is it Neuros?
It's on hardware and stuff.
Yes.
You can plug a USB stick into it any size you want.
The key card.
The key that I was looking for is optical output.
It doesn't have that.
Because I want the pure sound, the 5.1 surround sound channels, stuff like that.
And HDMI output.
So you can stream full HD on this box.
I don't know how you can see on your network.
You can see that.
The higher cable bandwidth.
And it doesn't have an ultimate third inside the case to put a hard drive in.
So you push the card.
It's like 200 bucks.
Neuros.
Neuros.
Neuros.
Neuros.
Neuros.
It's about kind of six days.
Yeah.
It's a little cheaper.
Yeah.
It's just turning.
It's very good.
It's bringing data in on your network that you're sending it.
Right.
It's turning it in.
It's turning it in.
I was able to try putting my PC next to my TV.
You know, I've got a nice screen TV.
I've got an entertainment center.
I got to put that.
But you know, in my room and stuff.
That PC then became dedicated to my whole entertainment center.
And I no longer use it as a PC.
So I actually lost a PC by doing that.
Because you just don't use it as a PC anymore.
It's there.
You've got to move over by the TV or keyboards on other stuff.
Well, so this box basically put on your home and your payment set.
And then wherever your PC is in your house, whether it's a windows or there's links,
it will attach that source and pull the stuff off through menus and remote.
You know what I'm talking about?
It's, you know, it's, no, it's, you need a network.
It's your hardware now.
It's actually, and it comes with a remote.
The password box has a remote and it pulls up a menu.
But then it's getting the information off your PC through your home network.
And you're like allowing it to look at certain files on your PC.
You just tell if the director is learning movies or if the director is learning your MP3s are.
And then it produces a menu choices.
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about.
Something like that.
I thought you'd have to stick a computer by your TV.
Well, that's really what it is.
It's sort of like a computer that's already got all the software in, but no hard drive.
It's just looking for a repository where all this information is.
And then they're slowly updating the firmware to be able to go after different websites.
They've got two or three websites.
Like who will or something like that.
You can play on it.
Wow, I'm going to check that out.
Yeah, it's probably a point out.
I haven't met TV box.
It's definitely a TV right now.
Yeah.
There's always information for they need to do that.
All that other than that is I put the new boot to my EPC.
And it's getting better and better each time.
I know I'm going to have to compile my own wireless drivers for the EPC.
It's all built into the emergency stuff.
It works really well.
It's pretty silly.
It's just that I get about 50 updates a day.
That's the brand new boot to?
Yeah.
Eight out of ten.
Or eight out of four.
Oh, and eight out of ten.
Did you try that the boot to has, I think they collect that.
Red.
Red.
Red book edition.
No.
No.
That's actually the one which they are pushing with the Dell.
What's that?
Yeah.
It's something like Red book edition or something like that.
It's something like that.
It is a Ubuntu flavor.
And it is archiday.
They provide it with Dell.
The thing about this popcorn hour is it doesn't actually have any tuner or anything like that.
No.
It's something that you just need.
So, how do you watch regular TV that?
You don't watch regular TV some of that.
You don't use this for anything.
It's for your stuff that you can put on hard drive.
Okay.
And I've been watching all IEVV's and all my CDs.
I've already ripped them and you put them on my hard drive.
The ones there.
It's just something that they would add on to here would be a mint TV front end.
Yeah, that would be something that would be very useful on this.
And then you put the back end someplace else on your network.
Down in the basement or something.
That would be too easy.
This is like an ice-cold slot.
This is not part of the box.
I don't know.
I do like this.
The VLB.
So it should.
Really?
Yeah, so you should just be able to come up with a VLC.
We'll open it up in the VLC.
The VLC will open it up in the VLC.
You can open it up in the VLC.
You can open it up in the VLC.
All right.
Here's the list.
Empangues from part of the lower.
Empangues to PS.
VLB.
ABI.
ASS.
WNV.
MKV.
MOV.
There it does be.
Expid.
Empangues.
One, two, four.
One was made in player 9.
H.264.
UBC1.
And then audio.
AAC.
Empangues.
Audio.
Wave.
Don't you want to take a flashlight from.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They have three products basically.
They have a lower end of this box.
This is their newer model that they came up with.
And then that's a PC board that you can modify and change.
Like they said, by the time you get done adding the case,
and all that stuff, you're back to PC, you know.
And here is actually that.
That's the actual box right there.
This one doesn't have remote.
Yeah, that doesn't have remote.
This one.
Yeah.
Three.
Oh, that's just that.
And that's the lower end version.
It doesn't have a couple things that they are.
Can you do something like watch YouTube videos through it?
Yes, you can.
They're basically.
Did they say?
Yes.
They mention certain sites that you can do that they do.
When we talked about it, there was an update for boxy,
which is like Web 2.0 player like that.
And that one is streaming YouTube.
Or whatever media you have on it.
So that works the browser.
Or do you have to put a client in it?
I think there is a client.
There is a group of clients.
Does it do 1080p?
What do you have to download?
Was that like an update for more?
What is?
Well, it has a download section.
So it was made plug-in for more.
Or by the directions.
Yeah.
They come all the firmware part of that.
They use firmware to add more actions.
Or add some more actions and more things like that.
You know what?
It does 1080p?
Yes.
So they say if you really...
They have to add the merchandise internally,
in order to do put through your network best enough.
So they aren't either in team.
If you go through the network, you're going to get a non-gitter.
Yeah.
I can barely get a high depth signal.
Like a 1080i would barely go through a 100 base network.
Really?
That's like even through a wire.
Yeah.
That's like...
They recommend you adding a hard drive if you're going to use 1080p.
That's a buffer or you actually have the hard drive with the movies is built.
So you can put a save of the drive directly inside the box.
Because I make it use as a hard drive as a buffer.
So you can use it for a possibility of your videos or...
I don't make you a buffer, I don't know.
But I have some specifications.
It's a buffer with the drives inside.
Did you buy one?
I purchased one, but they're on the gas of the high demand right now.
We're all three, four weeks out.
So can you give us...
Yeah, as soon as I get her up and running, I'll let you know.
So we have meeting in your house next time?
Yeah, right.
Well, the MKV is huge because open source movies you get like 12 gig files.
Thanks.
Very simple questions.
Yeah.
Can you say go on there?
Actually, I don't want to...
You call me the source movies.
Wow.
Is it like...
Like a pirate bay?
No.
Open source movies.
You got like the next one you can use for your own movies, right?
Open source.
This would be perfect.
It has MKV, actually, and Divics.
All through a high death of these.
See, you can buy it here.
We can Norway.
I looked on the info page.
They list...
I think it's so specific.
Please tell their informants.
You can...
You just...
You just...
You know, back up your stuff with the image.
I think it's one of those things you better buy now.
It's gonna be like...
Sword in the...
I think it's the best version.
I think it's the best version.
I think you're totally aware of another drive.
When you get a larger handle on a condom.
I think it's the best version.
OneTarile.
I think it's the best version.
I think it's the best version.
Just ISO.
Yeah.
It's gonna be used in spending 20 hours of disk training.
You'll buy it in the state.
There's no U.S. listing.
Let's get a resell...
That's for resell.
Yeah, you'll buy it in a bit.
Just say buy me.
I'm a bookmarker. It's going on like Christmas gifts.
What do you mind doing?
Are they directly selling it or do you buy it like through?
They're directly selling it.
So where's the fly?
It actually used to do the car.
Google's pay thing if you want to use that.
Oh, pay for it.
Google check out.
And the reason I ended up with this is I wanted to get
a good interface between my EPC and my home entertainment center.
So what I was really looking for was an external USB sound card.
Well, that's why I had a creative lab.
It's really nice.
Oh, here's a pre-arge.
I could get a good controller.
I mean, I could get a good controller.
But there's no software.
And it's going to come out of the optical play.
So I ended up saying, okay, I'll try this.
You need an iPhone.
You want an iPhone?
A bit of a nice thing is that my design can use this lab.
Not that you can send this stuff to us.
Wow, that's neat.
I like that.
We've got a plug-in design contest.
It's got a fuse.
I think it is an open source type.
Are you?
Well, they have their community on the top.
What about me?
I mean, they wouldn't have a plug-in.
That's what they have on the board.
Because they see what they're talking about on the board.
It was like a book board.
Oh, I like that.
I like that thing.
So how do you get it?
Then just get a Sri Lankan.
That doesn't have a tuner.
You have a tuner, a tuner, a tuner, a tuner.
I don't have a TV.
You have a tuner.
Projector to have a tuner too.
So I've got to have something with the tuner.
Yeah, I've got a tuner.
I want a USB plug-in in the USB plug-in.
I do have a USB plug-in in the USB plug-in.
I do have a USB plug-in in the USB plug-in.
I've got a small one.
Who knows if this box can actually take it.
I want to know, you know, I bought a wild one.
I've got one USB drive.
I bought a USB drive.
I bought a USB drive.
But there's something in it.
My projector.
So it's better to have a USB drive.
I've been holding Sony for 20 years.
All right.
So there's one good.
Well, that's awesome.
That's two minutes of fame.
I know.
You know how famous.
So what do you serve when you come to check your stuff in your house?
What's that?
What do you serve when we come to check?
You can sell your beer.
I can't sell the beer.
You can donate.
You can't sell the beer.
I am giving away.
You can request.
I can have a cover charger on the house.

Please watch this video to chapter name.

Please watch this video to the next page.
Please watch the video to the next page.
I can't pull all the tree over what you buy, it has a condo motor.
What? Wait, please.
Anybody else?
I want to dive with all the jobs.
Yeah, I like the beer. I didn't know you were going to be a sell.
But it was awesome. I love that one.
It was very good.
It was very good. I liked the flavor and wasn't as scale as the others.
So I had a little more zip in it as you know what I mean.
I like it.
I like it.
You had a very good job.
Yeah, it was very good.
Well, next match is probably kind of next.
It's going to be another stouter.
It's not, it's a, it's a pale ale.
But I was tasting one last Saturday and tasted very much like the stout.
So I'm not that happy about that.
You have a clean.
Is that what I said?
And then, that's where you get all your flavor from.
Yeah.
It's filled up.
Isn't that what you make block beer?
That's what I said.
Isn't that what you make in casserole?
What's that?
Isn't that how grandma was making casserole?
Have a clean, uh, the block beer.
Seriously, that's how you make block beer.
You basically just put a batch in there after the winter.
From it in the spring.
It makes block beer.
It's just putting ingredients in without cleaning the vats.
I don't know.
I did it in some ways.
That's what pockets in the van most of the time.
It was very good.
Yeah.
I was good.
We had it with a mexicali kind of.
Yeah.
It's like a little bit of honey in your lemon flavor.
Yeah.
Doesn't it have more of a more carbonation to the most stout?
And I like that.
It gives me a lot of fun.
I think you do buy a bunch of gingerbread and you reuse the bottles.
That was a bad joke.
I'm taking empty bottles from the ginger beer.
Or you can go down the lines and I've heard they'll give you lots of bottles.
Ah, those are festival.
Are they on the old?
Excuse me?
Why do you eat the empty bottles?
They don't see the empty bottles.
They don't see the bottle.
You actually need to have a special twist.
It's a different thing.
Okay.
So you would have a different twist tops so that you couldn't twist them.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know, I'll throw them you'll twist them.
And then I tried something today with SSH.
But I was told that I didn't mind the time for it.
But I did.
You can do dynamic pork.
Yeah.
You have to split it.
I was like, I remember I tried it and I just heard about it.
Well, I'm here.
And it worked.
I was like, let's say instead of my IP, just coming from my house and out of the Wi-Fi spot
I was at.
I was like, it's great.
I feel like I'm going to make it.
It's really cheap.
It's a gas solution.
All the pumps out what you can have.
Yeah.
Well, that's the stage.
It's really flexible.
Yeah.
So back to my house.
And then I'll come back to my house.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So back to my house.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, there's, yeah.
There's a little bit more to it.
But the most likely way to do it.
I mean, is that.
No, he's actually done with X 11.
Yeah, I'll do the SSH.
I would just let that sit there on my PC and there even if I type in on my router and
I know I hate to mention the word, but as anyone done with putty on windows, that's why I use putty.
You've got the random dynamic port forting the work?
The problem is that putting a program is...
They don't tell you what he's saying.
No, I'm trying to kind of...
They do have a good decent outfit.
How you want to do.
And I actually read that in order to figure out how to build a field and a shirt and that's the same way.
So you hate to do that?
I got it to work.
I didn't get to work yet.
But it worked just like that in Linux, but the putty thing it didn't work.
So for a guy like me who doesn't understand this stuff, what are you doing?
What's the advantage to what you're doing?
Well, for example, like if here you want to browse the internet, do some other stuff for each of your emails or whatever.
By coming home, it's an encrypted session from your PC to your home base.
So whatever you can hear can't be sniffed locally.
It's all encrypted.
And in addition, all the access to the internet is coming from your house rather than coming from here.
So from all the internet sites that you're browsing to, they see it as coming from your home and not from here.
From using the product we will do it as such.
How do you like to do that?
With the SSH, you have the bill to say this port on this PC is actually the port you need to go up the internet with.
It really works well.
It retails the app up to yours.
So in Linux browser, you tell your browser go to port and I use like that for me as a proxy.
So in Linux, the document is SSH, space or name, add your server, space, dash, capital D, space, then the port, like 88 or you'd set 1080.
Then you go into the Firefox, go into the proxy settings, and then the proxy seat, you go to the socks, local, and then put in local host, 88 and the port.
It's sort of pointing your browser to your own PC on that port.
And then it goes to your SSH or tier or mayor.
But then suddenly you're running that proxy server locally and they tunnel through SSH, tier piece.
But putty didn't do that, so I don't understand.
Yeah, like I said, I can't trouble with putty for once I've got that help.
They've probably helped with that, and that's really strange you put it there.
But once I did, it started working and stuff, so try to help.
As mentioning sniffing, I read an interesting article this week about keyboards.
Some British academics tested keyboards, and all keyboards currently that they were able to find currently embedded in laptops, and any other keyboards that you have, not USB or PS2,
not like wire, some radio, some sort of transmission thing.
Are vulnerable to being sniffed or tapped into as far away as like 20 or 30 years?
That's been true since 1970s.
Now apparently there's plenty of active software out there that will listen to your keyboard.
And wireless keyboards?
Any keyboard?
Not a wireless keyboard?
You mean like your radio interface?
What's up with the thing that's acceptable?
Yeah, it picks up the electronic impulses that are operating within the keyboard.
As well as V would be more paranoid, they were saying while you are typing, actually every key is making different sound.
Yeah, I got this up.
Three students that you see Berkeley use the 10 minute recording of a keyboard to recover 96% of the character's type during the session.
Oh really?
And to be able to be more paranoid, there was something about that whatever your screen is projecting actually can be monitored,
and the same somebody can actually recreate whatever you are watching.
So just going in a black room and don't type.
It's said they were able to break 80% of 10 character passwords in fewer than 75 attempts.
So in 75 attempts, 80% of the passwords that were 10 characters they broke.
And I know that's why Windows is so secure.
You don't have to type.
You just point and click.
Yeah, they've had a mouse wiggle into your password.
Absolutely.
And then when you hear that, some people keep another window open.
And every time you have to type a password, they'll type a couple letters and go to the other window, type a couple letters.
And then you back and clear it down so that if it's key logging, you get a string and stuff with the password in there somewhere.
But it's not.
It's not going all the way.
You've got to be very paranoid to do that.
Well, or have a lot of viruses on your, where if you're running Windows, that'll be the case.
Yeah, because you thumbprint it anywhere else besides.
I don't know.
Right.
Especially if you don't put your thumb anywhere.
Or the Irish stand.
I'd really trust that.
Not the malfunctioning.
Right.
And I don't.
I said.
I said, it's a low, low mill wallet.
Yeah.
I saw, I said once, the Irish scanner.
And it looked very awkward.
Yeah.
And people were staring into it.
And it was like, it doesn't, not warm in the fuzzy feeling.
No.
Maybe young people will get used to it.
Is that, is that too high?
I do get it right somewhere that this new, you know, supposedly 2010, 2012, Windows, a new, you know, a really big step.
I think that's supposed to have the webcam do facial recognition as a security.
I think that's supposed to come standard with this new system that you're putting in.
It's a face.
I don't know about it.
I could just see it.
And that would be Windows level security.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I was like, hey, you shaved the finger.
I'm not letting you in.
All right.
I have my kids at Pleasant Valley Farm, taking pictures.
I've got the face from the Instagram camera.
And they have a big cut out with a pumpkin.
And it kept recognizing the pumpkin face.
The camera did the box-a-go around the pumpkin.
All of it was on the pumpkin.
We're black eyes and all of the black, you know.
Easy fun.
Forget it.
Forget it.
It was all pumpkin.
So that's how you break Windows password and starting in version, whatever.
You hold up a pumpkin.
Yeah.
It's just there.
And Windows password.
It's just given another password.
Because nobody could ever take a picture of you and hold the picture.
Right.
That's true.
Oh.
Did you ever did the thing where you submit your picture online?
And it could be as if it was a potential famous people?
No.
I didn't know that.
And you can take your pictures and then take your face, structure apart.
And then they look at things, people.
I guess I can close the station because I have David back up.
Oh yeah.
David, David.
Yeah.
He's a soccer player.
I'm playing rocks in America right now.
Better than David Hassel auf.
Come on, David Hassel!
He's TVBusloader.
He's like super star simplemente so if you guys can play, we're going to just end up on this program?
Yes!
This is important to Chris.
I don't know how they got the potatoes in there, yeah, the potatoes in there, yeah, the potatoes in there.
They watch right here to understand that's a lot of you all day.
But it was all season later, when he talked to Joe, he was in the video, and he talked a lot.
Yeah, he talked to actually pretty fluent Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
He didn't even move in Joe.
That's part of reason.
Are you still out here two minutes?
No.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.

Just gut, go on on the ones that you had looked up before.
I need the heat.
I need the heat.
We have plenty of electricity, so far!
You need the heat.
There's more that summer.
Cutting heat to eat about a particular gender of ...
All due to gender roles.
No.
I used also the waste heat from the respirator.
Maybe we should take it to where your house start selling or back to excel
Yeah, that's
That's a more complicated than you think
Actually come come up to much because you have to actually cave in the sell back to the start-off a P in them
$20 a month to be able to do it sure, so then you got to just generate $20 like Trissi just to get a lot of zero city
20 bucks to buy a lot of like
Yeah, I'm exactly so you plan on making it through the winter with all
Using grid stuff. Yeah, we did the last one
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yep, I think a couple weeks ago
We have
It looks like
Looks in the world
It's like a small thing
That pretty much take a lot of good daily basics
Just invest in this company
That wasn't
No, if you think that if everybody just generate how about a city would they use you know how much
I've heard mixed results on wing power
Ever people would say oh yeah works fine and then I've heard people to say no, it doesn't work or crap
But if you want this is one on six
Giga watch
No mega watch not giga mega
That's all big ones big ones the big ones are on left for five stories tall
What the new ones for the one point six you make a lot not giga wide
Like the great big huge power plants are only giga wide a few giga
Okay
You have kind of lame hard to make
We could be you know
And but there once
V1 and what the biggest problem is is transmission
When that the six I have ones to go for fine
But now the bigger ones which transmission cannot hold up and the one there's one company and a cop and a cop
That's how often has some
There's a legal fight
There's free one that's free running that's right. They're generating a truck that they have to
And then not because it's transmission pilots
They cannot generate as much power
But on the middle left the coordinates are higher and not a long run because
You don't have transmission you don't lost energy and you don't have to make this work
They're much more efficient. So the years
Capitalize even the 1.5 compared to 1.6 and 1.7
But the model literally actually how is it
Especially without the really optimal standards and I like the range you much more efficient
so
But
5%
So glad to have some room
Is the win charts don't go
For this area they just don't panel
I mean we're gonna go a high
All
Even then we just don't have wind here like they have with you know if you look where they put them
They're out in the plains with the other one
Great line all the time when I'm driving to Ohio
There were actually a few trucks which by holding the bases and it was on a three trucks for one base
It was huge
Yeah
That was down in
I got the numbers here too
1600 kilowatts
Is the standard rate or the rate for the 100 is 1.6
Yes, bar ride
Yeah, what ever I said about you know, I'm taking back that was a gig on half a thousand
So
What was that all what you've done? That's all
That was quite a bit
Yeah, yeah, they've been switching this and doing switching that
That's a stage to it
Right, bodies they say that the biggest ones can now generate up to about five megawatts
That's what I'm sure
But the problem is I'm sure but perhaps it's erosion
The power of the water
There's some of the whole thing so a lot of fun you try
And then
The first thing I did was taking it off
Using an ability to make hydrogen right away because the problem is you probably still
Like you said you're middle of nowhere and you have to like all the sides
Transmitted by people living
Or why do you use it?
Hydrogen is such a part of the transport. Yeah, it's a transfer because you've got you not used on that for gas lines
They're not good enough to transport this
It depends if you want to blow it up
That's a small detail
But I was, you know, one of the summit only one at the gas line but you can't not know
Well, also the efficiency is when you look at the
Compared to things what you actually generate in power
Compared to coal that's using twice the sweetener
Like energy that nuclear use in the front
Well, now you defeat the crap because you need to have a great hatchet and a white one there
So it's not going to be efficient
By the way that website that you can compare yourself to celebrities is called myheritage.com
Well, y'all like Mr. Wikipedia
So I would have brought you home or Simpson
Like 100%
99.6%
I think yes
It would really fit
I can you got a picture of yourself. I know I I don't want to see how you do you scan again?
No, you just you just
So don't try to
To take a picture of your ad is your mom or dad for England?
Well
I don't know
Okay
Let's let's
We don't have to have a history lesson here
I didn't have yet
I don't know what is it
Actually, I try open office 3.0 and I try the PDF editor
And that you're pretty good
I was very
I was very pleased with that
That's in the open office PDF editor
Yeah, you you need to download a plugin
Okay
And so I had actually existing PDF file and I wanted to just move it around
And we're pretty good
It shows
Yes
What if the PDF was actually like an image that was turned into a PDF?
What it worked then?
Yeah, I think we're able to scan it
But all you get is a bit
Yeah, I used it
Because PDF is
You can have images embedded in the PDF
So you've got an image in a PDF
Even when you go to edit it
Yeah, what I used it for is I had some sheet music that was scanned and put in PDF
For some reason
This one program we were trying to put it into
It wouldn't make the PDFs the way you got it
It was one of these printers that printed the PDF
It wouldn't print more than like a couple of pages of the sheet music at a time
I'm proud it was just a limitation in the program
Copyrights. So what I ended up having to do was combine
To get one file for my little portable music
Pad thing
I had to combine the PDF files
Otherwise I had to switch files in the middle of the music
You know, which was kind of inconvenient
So I wanted to make one continuous PDF file at it and just aged through it
And I used that to combine the PDF files
You see, you could probably do that right from the command line that's going to file
No, but you can't
No, you can't, you can't if you open up the PDF files
But there's like headers and footers on the PDF files that you got to get that right
And it counts pages
And that was the critical thing
I don't want to be able to use the foot switch page button
And have it advanced pages properly
So I had to get that right
As you are saying that you wanted to add pages or remove pages
But Google had a book about hacking the PDF
And the guy who wrote it also too, he called it
PDFTK
Or TKPBF as a PDF toolkit
And that one actually was able to combine PDFs
Or remove the pages from the middle
And to do that, that was pretty easy with that tool
It was an airline too
What is a PDF, a text file?
Or what is it?
It's like a text file, but it is
It has its own
It's kind of a wild format
It works in principle of a PDF file
Full script, great
It's a language that is interpreted to display the document
The key of PDF and PDFs of PDFs
It doesn't matter what system you're printing it on
Or what printer you're printing it to
It would always be the same
Right, I know that
The industry started using it because it did such a big job
Yeah, we're actually true here
The second thing is
Most people read it was free
But you could modify it
So a lot of people
were also controlling
That you couldn't copy a piece
To start out of it and take it
We didn't know that's pretty good
And now it's for free
You shouldn't have to pay for a damn file
It's free
It's very awesome
So what else did I do?
I broke
I think I broke my beer
Yes, I did broke my beer on a Sunday
So
You just started beer
Do you want to be in there?
No, I don't need a drink in a true state
So
So I need to spend time growing beer
Why would I organize beer?
I think that's related to a PDF file
I'm glad to be glad to be in your literature
Cool, I think that's all
You don't have to pay for it
And you have to go through
You have to go through
How about you?
And they may access your
I have this
Oh, you got it
And what it is?
It's my Android phone
Oh, I thought it was
What is it?
It's an Android phone
It's a mobile
It's got a big clock out
That's the most important
That's the most important
That's the most important
Too much
Who cares? It's got a DAC
Yeah, it's got a DAC
They look fine
The website reader is pretty snazzy
You can zoom around
Have you looked at some of the applications you can put on there?
I put Pac-Man on here
You can put Pac-Man with the extolar monitors
That's going to interest
Just don't drive
It doesn't
It's got built-in GPS
It also will attempt to triangulate your position
Based on cell towers
Which will get you
Within the radius of a cell tower
So they say that
It's not sending in
Instead of calling for me
Yeah, they'll find out
Basically it tells me I'm in the city of Old Claire
On the set here in the GPS
I did get the weather channel
Has an app you can install it
Pretty well
There's no 3G here
Yeah, so it's kind of
It has to be Wi-Fi
You get the GPRS
It's got Wi-Fi built-in
Some of the two
Which I think is kind of
What do you have?
What is it even that thing?
The C-Mobile G1
And what is it?
It's the Android operating system
From Google
Team mobile service always
Yes, it's a larger team
What does that have to be?
I put it back at its cost
What does the SROS for that thing cost a month?
There are data plans
I think they started like 20 months
A month or an hour
Yeah, but they don't have everything
I think if you sign up with two-year agreements
I think I'll call them
Just make a phone call somehow
How much a month?
Well, whatever service might be good
100 or 50
I think they're like, they started
So we've dealt with shared data
And we've seen it
I didn't actually name it my site
We just got it
That's actually HTC
Yeah, I guess it would be
You need to think the road is in that kind of skype
But your Google with tone information
And it comes up with your calendar, your email,
Your contract
Everything's integrated into it
So it's my biggest complaint about my other phones
And I have to try to synchronize it
And never really recall it
Do you know why it's that the Google Mail worked with
And that it's the one
It's mostly bad
I guess the Google is the sponsor of Android
Did they call it Android?
It is, isn't it?
I mean, that's the rule
Well, it's got their
I don't know if it's a Chrome
It's something like it
But the nice thing is
The whole board name is open
So if anybody can write an application
Yeah, you can download it
And they've got the
What do they call it?
Marketplace, there's a bunch of games and stuff in there already
Like I said, I got the weather channel headed up
The application is pretty good
It doesn't do map and motions
Otherwise, you can look at precipitation
Clouds and radar indicators
And all kinds of stuff
Does it talk to you?
YouTube videos
It's got a YouTube thing built into it
Did you have to install it on there?
It came with that
It doesn't have play
Well, it's pretty stuff like this live
I don't think you want to know anything
Like it's dark
I think that some
Is against programs for that
People actually play with it
That's a US thing
But it doesn't have a lot of time
And that's a normal time
If you go by pizza
If you go by pizza
There's a pizza
I'm sure it will
Do you turn it into a pizza
The HTC is like the new
That HTC brand
Phone to the guy
It should be lower
It's a big handheld
Yeah, the last one I had was made by HTC
I actually hated it
When it was mobile
Could you
You've got a HTC from all tele
Could you download this
Just put the menu at the top
Download Android
And install it
I don't think you can install it
Is it done?
You can go get the
Developing kit
And right there
Or it comes with a little
Emulator so you can test it
You can write hello Android
Hello Android
Five hours talk time
And all five days
Depends on what you get
Wi-Fi turned on or two of the GPS
So what's the memory of storage
I don't even know
What's the gigabyte SD card in it
I've heard you could get it
Yeah, I think it's the high capacity
So it's just operatable
Yeah, so it's
It's a little track ball
No, it's creepy
No, it was actually
It is interesting
It's okay
Where did you buy it?
I bought it from the T-Mobile website
So we've had T-Mobile for like six years
So it upgrade my phone
It's been over and I said okay
All five days
It's pretty decent
Yeah, I mean if we go away
In the country sometimes
You know, away from the freeway
We'll start roaming
It's pretty good until you get
Off the beaten pads
It's like it's wallpill
And that's much better up there
You can close to the cities and then you can
Tell us better areas that have the 3G service
It's good
They work in the USA
And they actually have the 3G service
They are German based
Yeah, they are German
And when I take my T-Mobile
She oversees
It doesn't have a service
And I call them that I want that
They said
You make your telephone unlock
And you buy yourself a SIM card over there
Yeah, I mean this is 21 instead
I think it's the European standard
No, no, different frequency
My telephone has all frequency on
No, it doesn't
It's just a SIM card
But you know, it's a T-Mobile
Here it's a T-Mobile over there
And you know it should be
And it knows
That it has a service
It just doesn't tell me that I allowed
To access the
And it gives me time here
From old players
It's the US companies that lock it down
Because of that
All over Europe phones work
They don't have to worry about a country
And do you know?
No, it's like they're not
I mean, it's everywhere
They figure
They talk that you can actually
With this T-Mobile you can go internationally
They think about internationally
You go to Canada and Mexico
That's it, internationally
But do you want to go to Europe?
Yeah, you have to do a different SIM card
And I know that AT&T I can take my telephone
AT&T, that's right
But I don't know why T-Mobile doesn't work
Is that the correct thing?
Yeah, so there's
They can make more money by making it down
I think they can play more money
That would really translate to much more money
Because how many people are going to do it?
No, it's not that what they're doing is controlling
The advertisers
What they're seeing this role is potentially
A way of delivering you to advertise
And so what they're trying to do is
Control the advertising markets
And advertising is always based on the accuracy of the market
You're going to reach through that menu
From my point of view, I have the telephone
And I go to Minnesota
And I know that they have T-Mobile
But I don't get to their service
That's the same thing what they are doing
Which I don't understand why they do that
Well, as I say
I think what the industry experts are saying
And what they're exploring in these hearings
Is that companies see this as being
Yeah
And essentially, the way everything you're going to do
Is going to be from your smartphone
In other words, in PCs and all that stuff
You're going to fade into that round
And you're going to do your shopping
And all your purchasing
And you're going to walk up to the soda machine
And hold up your phone
And it's going to charge your credit card
For the can of soda that pops out
This is like that
The main reason they're trying to control access
Like that is you have to do with future uses
For things like that
Sure, and they'll be sure that
That's where they're sending the ads
Because, right
The whole point of advertising
Is that you don't want to spend money
When people who couldn't possibly
Interested in what you're trying to get them
To know what they want
I'm using that service
You want to target that as much as possible
And that's the whole reason they're using for data collection
And stuff like that is to try to make
Advertising dollars more effectively
I'll tell you what they should
No, they don't
My watching ads was actually
Interested in buying stuff
No, I mean, that's true
It's very rare that I see an ad
Actually interesting
So for the popcorn, I have to buy out that
I'm looking for something
Unless it's a tequila ad
Oh, I still have to think that
Yes, you do, I should start there
There was some ad about tequila
And I'm not sure if it's true
If it's just a joke
It is like a medical ad
And it's like, do you feel kinetic?
Are you blah, blah, blah
And try tequila
And the first thing I'd run
Like that on the market
There's just people going out of the water
And it's like tequila
You know what going out
Do you have anxiety drug
What the hell is it?
They had an ad just like that
Like, well, I just get drunk
You'll feel good there
It's essentially one of us
All right, who's two men's fame are we on?
Are we done?
With a tequila?
I think so
Your telephone didn't come back yet?
No, I've never seen it yet
I've never seen it yet
Special deal with the deal
Nigeria, don't forget
I'm trying out the internet gambling
The media here
Say Mr. Macbubu that was the last
But it's not what dealing with it
It's not what the insurance said
I was thinking
It was basically
It was the insurance
And the insurance
And the insurance
And the head is the billion dollar
And you need to trace her, you need to help
Except it was for my
Also
The head is the
Yeah, those Nigerian people
And I saw that one
Yeah, Jasper Lee need
Had a $7,700 trillion to transfer
Jasper Lee need you to
Throw in your $40,000
Like a
Trans for the money
How many people still have to
You may also talk to your boss
It's true
It's true
You know
I'm not listening
I'm just
You know
You know, we talk about updates
If I want to update if I have
So open up
You do a normal update
Up is a best goal to get through
Or move it
It would just update
If it's in repository
It's just the update
I don't want to freak you out
You talk about that next week
Yeah
I don't want to freak you out
But Jasper too
And really what it's doing when it's
Updating is it is
Removing the old one
Putting the new one on
All on one step
So anything that would have been
Removed, I removed it
Is the new one
And then replaced with the new one
Hey guys
My boss doesn't have it
Wow
I think it's just
Just your patent
You know, patent
You know, patent
But density works and
Intrepid
Well, yeah, and the thing is
Major upgrades like that
They might not do it
Except for with operating system updates
If you want to
Do a major version of
A lot of time you do it at sound
Otherwise it's going to say
For, you know, 7, 10
Like, we want to list version
But it's what I'm going to make in jump
To 3
Generally, it's not a good idea to skip version
Even if you can't do that
You can't do that
Right, you can't go
Stepping eyes through whatever is going on
Right
That was just right
And that was the thing
That's what I think
That's what the websites
Play out in this media play out
And I think
You should be able to
Watch little things, right?
There's another question
The thing you might want to watch
Not plugins is they don't always go
To the next version
Throw away some of your plugins
And your add-ons
Because they don't work with the new version
But then you can
Firefox has a
Utility that
Otherwise you win
Your discarding plugins
And add-ons from
Upgraded to the current version
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
And on-screen
Is the Tequilahead
Is the Tequilahead
This isn't a totally quiet speaker
So that's why I am trying this
Just keep it going
Hang on
All right
Do you have feelings of inadequacy?
Do you support from Shynis?
Do you sometimes wish you
Were more assertive
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about tequila.
Tequila is the safe, natural way to feel better and more confident about yourself and your actions.
Tequila can help ease you out of your shyness and let you tell the world that you're ready and willing to do just about anything.
You'll notice the benefits of tequila almost immediately, and with a regiment of regular doses, you can overcome any obstacles that prevent you from living the life you want to live.
The shyness and awkwardness will be a thing of the past, and you'll discover many talents you never knew you had.
Stop hiding and start living with tequila.
Tequila may not be right for everyone.
Women who are pregnant or nursing should not use tequila.
However, women who wouldn't mind nursing or be coming pregnant are encouraged to try and such things.
This is a nausea, vomiting, incarceration.
A rod at Leslan is loss of motor patrol, loss of clothing, loss of money, loss of virginity, delusions of grandeur.
They may as well end the hydration, drive out, and a desire to see karaoke and play all night, browse a strip ochre through their dare, and naked twister.
Morning, the conception of alcohol may make you think you're whispering when you're not.
It's a major factor in dancing like a retard.
It may cause you to tell your friends over and over in that you're in love with them.
Also, it may cause you to think you can see.
Alcohol may lead you to believe that ex lovers are really dying for you to telephone them at 4 in the morning.
Alcohol may make you think you can logically converse with members of the opposite sex without spitting.
It may create the illusion that your tougher, smarter, faster, and better looking than most people.
And it may lead you to think people are laughing with you.
Alcohol may cause pregnancy.
And it also may be a major factor in getting your ass kicked.
So what are you waiting for?
A star hiding.
And start living with tequila.
I see we're working on our transition to booze.
Absolutely, I don't know why.
And what do you mean?
That's the only funny thing.
See, and this is actually in your podcast.
I wasn't sure it was true, but no.
Well, cool.
How about you?
I guess I didn't do much this last week.
I've still been running those two email servers running Squirtle Mail on.
One was on a new one.
A bunch of one was on an old one.
I got like our singing together.
So they stayed pretty much together.
It's been working great.
Every now and then it was getting slow, but I think that was an effort from.
And I think that's fixed, but I'm not sure.
It hasn't done it again since.
But every now and then, like when you log on through SSH or something,
every line would come up real slowly.
Like it'd be printing all the characters one by one.
But then later in the day, it'd be perfectly fast.
I think it was the network.
What does it say?
Like a swapspace problem.
Maybe it's brand new machine.
Nothing else.
It could be just running out of memory.
Yeah, I mean, how long has it been acting?
No, it's not.
It's not making any sense.
Is this for you?
Is there anything at the time?
I think it could just be the network.
I think it.
I'm pretty sure it was.
For some reason, I haven't seen the use.
It should be the same thing.
And I checked that using that.
What does it say?
Something at the top?
Yeah.
Everything looked okay.
Okay.
That's it.
So you have that end actually here also on YouTube.
So you can watch.
Okay.
Don't click on those on the side.
I don't think those are supposed to be.
Those don't actually work.
You see what they do?
They pop a picture of a beautiful woman.
So you click on it.
And then it's something completely different.
I think, actually, if you are...
I know.
I can show you some sites that you have.
We do not need to know that.
You have the same type of open source stuff.
Oh, is that your open source stuff?
Yeah, I guess it's an open source picture.
I see.
Tiger.
I'm sorry.
We don't...
No, that was part of it.
Not using a program that's available for Linux.
I've been using it under Windows.
It runs well under Linux.
It's called Eagle for Laying Our Current Circus.
Yes.
Very good program.
I can't put it in today.
Yeah.
I actually just recently made a certain board using Eagle.
Okay.
Gary.
Actually took the Eagle file and created a certain board for me.
He's got all the stuff to make.
Oh, okay.
Now there were a few courses for this stuff.
It was an absolute program.
I've used a lot of them over the years and there are the best that I've come across.
How do you try out the G-Skin?
That's the G-E-D-A project.
It's got G-Skin.
This is like there, an open source version.
Probably the best open source one that's out there.
G-Skin.
Does the schematics.
And then there's a program called PCB for the board layout.
And really it's got about the same features as the Eagle.
The only thing it doesn't back annotate and the two aren't really tightly connected.
That's the best part of Eagle is that they use the same data basically.
Like when you change a schematics right away it reflects in the board.
Right.
So that's the key feature.
And hardly any programs have that until you spend tens of thousands of dollars.
Right.
I think it's really a good value.
Yeah.
And they have a free version that works up to boards.
Like 3 by 5 inches or something.
So that's a huge value.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is the source code available for that program?
No.
You could go fix it.
No.
No, but it has a very good scripting language built into it that you can do just for anything.
And there's thousands of scripts available.
Yeah.
Plugins and such.
Yeah.
It's interesting that they're at least offering a Linux version.
Yeah.
And the other product that I've been using that's all a good thing.
I think it's available for Linux too.
It's a compiler by a CCS company that makes a compiler for those little pick chips.
I think they have a Linux version.
Yeah.
There's a couple versions of that.
I know that at the app model microcontrollers, they are the compilers that they suggest to use.
It's actually GCC.
Okay.
So there's a version of GCC for these microcontrollers called BBRGCC.
Yeah.
And the song that you download off their website says, go download the free compiler.
And that's the secret pilot.
Yeah.
So it's a pretty good endorsement for GCC.
Yes.
And that's about it.
It's a legend.
It's a graphic stuff.
You can remember that.
Downloading and everything.
Well.
Yeah.
I don't have a lot more good attention span.
Oh, I made a little synthesizer.
A guy from Germany had posted this circuit that is a neat little synthesizer.
And he had all kinds of song clips and stuff too.
So I was announced.
I got a good one about this.
I did.
Oh.
I just just got it assembled a couple days ago.
And it works.
Just like it's supposed to.
It's kind of cool.
I was going to make a couple more and see if anybody wanted to know.
Elliot, could you make a forever suit that suit?
Good luck.
What?
No.
We ended up giving it a little break.
Good luck.
Elliot has picked up a synthesizer somewhere.
Oh, yeah.
I just wondered whether he didn't.
He says he gave it to somebody else.
So he's getting somewhere in this?
Yeah.
What kind of suit?
Oh, yeah.
That's not really a synthesizer.
It's more like an organ.
Yeah.
Does it have one of those ones where you flip a switch up for all the partials?
You know, like you think you hold on a chord.
And then you flip up all the switches and all the partials of the note coming in.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It would have just a root of the switches all over us.
It would have just a root of the switches.
I have a question.
If it's synthesizer and organ, wouldn't it actually altogether make organizer?
Sure.
There it is.
It's more of a disorganizer.
I think it's a traditional piece.
Oh, really?
Okay.
Was it actually a circle that I've been working on?
It's more of a controller.
Okay.
It's a little dears.
Yeah.
That's the way out.
Sure.
That works.
Yeah.
Eagle's great for that.
Is that GBA or is that Eagle?
That's Eagle.
Okay.
Where did you get your board?
Yeah.
It's very space.
Yeah.
The place I work at sends out quarter panel orders that are single-sided boards.

Well, if you're still at doolies, I'd love them.
I can leave it.
I doubt that.
You like that?
I don't know.
You're so, so, so.
Yeah.
That's what they got here.
That's what they got here.
That's what they got here.

No, we got to wait.

So, it can be ran into the street with Dale at last.
So, it says 32 hours.
Oh, it's just like a lamp burning out.
Hey, the lamp is going.
You have a hard one to see.
Uh-oh.
How the hell did he do it?
He can do it.
He can do it.
He can do it.
Yeah.
That's scary.
Maybe that's like he's selling a Mace to get some donuts.
Oh, no.
He seems like it's, yeah.
What does that mean?
What do you mean?
He's going.
You can see the length of the bottom left corner.
See that Lincoln lamp?
Deely?
Lincoln, Lincoln lamp is going.
Uh, they have a timer in there that says, you know,
those lights are only rated for hours or many hours.
They say that there's a lot ofcries.
Uhh, they don't actually want the lamp to fully burn out,
because that can be bad cause they can kind of...
That can go place.
time. Yeah, it's going to reset the tire. You're good.
You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good.

Yes. Yes. Okay, ideas.
I want you to understand. Do you understand. It depends on you. I want you to understand. it depends on you. okay, ideas.
Yes, yes, I know how to read and hear you I want you to understand. It depends on you. So that I'd say that I want to read. So that's a debate now.
Yeah, I mean, similar, yeah, okay, it's the same idea.
Yeah, what I use at home, I bought it.
Missy, I've never used one from a college,
so I went up to any part of it.
That's what I watch TV and movies and everything.
I wonder if it's almost burrowed out then.
Too many, too many movies.
Well, Missy, those are the most important.
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's movies.
I didn't even...
I had mine for...
How long have I had mine?
A year and a half?
I don't know.
Missy, you're 16 when all is on the floor.
Where is that thing about moving to do with Steve?
Did you say it's in a news letter?
Yes, where is it?
Did you send me email?
I guess I never did.
Well, send me email.
All right.
Here is Dave.
If you go to contact us.
Okay, contact us.
Here is the email address.
I want Miss Trod.
Missy Trod.
Me?
Well, it was looking some of that voice recognition for Linux.
Then it was not much to look at.
There's pretty much one package called Spinks.
I was going to look into that and see if I couldn't get something to a point where it was working.
They've got something called...
They've got a bunch of different versions.
Some of them do a lot of work.
They've got something called...
They've got a bunch of different versions.
Some of them do real time.
Some of them only are fast enough to do real time.
But they've got one called Pocket Space
that is actually meant for hand-held devices and such.
It looks front of the tutorial pretty simple to set up.
So I was going to try that out.
I haven't gotten around to it yet.
Let me try something like those home commands.
That's exactly what I thought.
That's what I was looking at.
I guess what they have is they actually have a website
that the biggest part of the voice recognition
is you need to have the training day.
That's really the big problem.
There's no open source training day.
They have some open source training day.
To get it into a useful form, you make up a file that says,
OK, I want these commands.
And you apply it to their website.
Your website will do the processing
and give you back the correct file
that will detect those words.
Because the more words get, the less accurate your recognition gets.
So you just give it a file that's got these 20 or 30 words
that you want to recognize.
And it will give you back the right files
and then you combine that in and do your thing.
Then it will actually recognize those words.
So it sounded interesting.
I'm going to try it out.
Maybe I can get it to work.
Maybe not. We'll see.
And the only other thing I was doing was I was playing with Bach a lot.
They didn't make it up.
From the command line.
OK.
It was pretty much for pattern matching stuff.
I don't know.
It just seemed like the reoccurring theme this week
that everything that I needed to do
just happened to be an odd command.
Is that like a super fine kind of thing?
Actually, it's more of a, like a graphite thing
or what it does is,
it's almost like a regular program.
It's a parser.
It's a parser.
You give it a file and for each line in the file
it splits on a separator
and it gives you, you know,
$1 is the first parameter $2
and then you can do regular expressions
to match each line
and then you can do something different
on the different regular expressions.
So like if you've got a file
with two different types of things
intertwined,
you can split that up with two files really easily
by doing regular expressions.
If you find this, you know,
print out the file one.
If you find this, print out the file two.
So there's a lot of stuff you can do with it.
Yeah, well, the regular expression is a small part.
The regular expression can be extreme with simple
and then do something else.
Like I was actually able to make a script
using the auth that would
find the previous business day.
Using the value I'm with the date.
Which is actually a hard thing to do.
Yeah, I just wanted to make a thing.
If you don't want to use regular expression
other things, you can do this too.
Well, yeah, and for that,
I mean, my regular expression was
number zero.
That's the one regular expression.
Number one.
Two or three seconds.
Those are the regular expressions.
Yeah, still.
Something that it doesn't.
Right.
Oh, the regular expression.
There it is.
Yeah, that's one.
Okay.
You do much as Adam is
something else.
I forgot to admit, I was playing with
SS Lins this week too.
It's SS.
If you have too many Lins.
What did I, it does a file comparison
that looks for, does a couple things.
One of them that I was interested in was
that it looks for duplicate files
and gives you some options about a handle
and what you want to murder together
and what else could you
search as your packages,
bad file names or name flashes,
temporary files.
It's kind of like, you know,
cleaning up.
What's the bad file name
that's really played?
Take a file name,
add a little bit of that.
I'm not sure how it turns out.
All I really played was
finding the duplicate files,
which worked pretty well in my
directory after a directorial.
Last made it back up to
and reinstalling the OAS
or trying something in eyes.
I'm sure I've got gigabytes
on gigabytes of stuff.
I need to clean up.
So find broken siblings
and those types of things too.
Or is it...
I believe so, yeah.
Like I said, I only played with the duplicate
and I should do the file part of it.
But it looked pretty robust.
Registrated fixer.
Bad siblings, bad IDs,
temp files, empty directories,
non-stricken binaries,
redundant blank space.
That was a bad joke.
Yeah, this one.
Cool.
Space one.
Space space one.
Space space space one.
Space space space,
charging to 551.
How about you, Elliot?
Do you do any...
I served the day.
Not today. This week, one time.
Hey, you're walking some from library.
Oh, no.
I don't know what you want to do here.
Yeah, some way.
Yeah, I don't know anyone.
I'm working.
I want you to work here.
Cool.
That's cool.
That's cool.
What kind of card?
You, sir.
That should be recent enough that, you know,
repairable.
Yeah, that's good.
You're not positive.
It's...
So, they thought it was you that had a chance to do it.
You can do it in there.
Well, anything is repairable.
Okay, plenty of money.
Yes.
So, shall we...
Shall we...
Oh, you do?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's see.
I have six thoughts.
Hm?
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I have a little storage device that deck up most of the same for crashing on me all the time to see.
So I have it there, but I don't have a deck up there.
There.
That was version 90 actual product.
See, the hardware is not bad, but does that give you a device using an old IBM file format?
If it's corrupt, there's no ways to get to it.
My Ubuntu machine compared to Windows.
It was same to Windows.
Ubuntu cannot get to a file, but at least it could get the IP number as well as the rest to it.
And I was looking online, and people all kind of hear all these people frustrated about it.
Because they're supposed to take this tool, but it's doing all this mixing.
So I gave up, and I just realized the good part is, oh my work.
From my computer, the client information is all good.
So I asked about the account.
Yes, people.
Why?
Why are you doing a piece of your own files?
It's the problem.
All my employee data, all the other things.
Everything that happened rack up on a computer working deck, purchasing the stuff.
So all of my old text filing, my old bookkeeping, my W2s and everything,
that's like computer-based, that's it.
Maybe I have all the paper for all of that.
Have I come all the way?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
So you didn't make a backup of the backup?
Not of that files.
Just a joke.
Just a joke.
Yeah.
And you make a backup, so you make a backup of the memory.
I don't get to...
Some online version of a long paper, and I'm not gonna say it to this.
I guess, I'm not talking about backup, but that's what I'm gonna change by...
Yeah, I'm trying to get better at that too.
Having a device and having some of them two backup from a two different hardware,
some of the majority of the files in the summer, but that was not the only one.
We organize everything, and I have the same problem with the editors,
that some of the flying copies on different PCs,
and the different updates,
and that's the only kind of challenging.
There will be some work and work to find out which file I actually want to save,
which file I need to go.
What's the current?
Where I'm going?
I have one set of people sent me a batch of them.
Yeah.
Leave me.
Instead of trying to backup all the programs and everything,
I'll let you guys backup my data.
I don't.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
One thing I've heard a lot of people do is actually set up a subversion repository,
and then they'll just go in, and they'll check in all the files that they want in the back door.
But you still need to backup your subversion server.
Well, let's see if the subversion server counts as the backup.
Because you have your local copy, and then you have the subversion repository.
And then two, if you're going to back it up,
you're not trying to backup this file, and this file, and this file.
Back up the repository, you don't.
But it would be a multiple good working as a file.
That's okay.
Subversion.
There you go.
That's perfect.
I like using those little USB drives.
You know the ones that are bus powered, and I just have some batch files,
and they're just our sync all the stuff over to them.
So I can swap those up.
I keep one at home, and one at work, and then once a month I swap them.
I've bought one of them at Sandstuff.
It's pre-installed.
Everything's working.
I've got a PC from back home.
Oh, really?
I flopped it into mine.
It doesn't even recognize it.
It doesn't swap yet.
Oh, that's too bad.
Let me fix up all the ones I've tried.
Yeah, this one does not.
And so that was...
Yeah, I went into the floor.
Sandstuff, they had it on zero.
It was like 85 to the 50 gigs.
Yes, people.
