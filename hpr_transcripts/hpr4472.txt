This is Hacker Public Radio episode 4472 for Tuesday the 23rd of September 2025.
Today's show is entitled, Cheap Yellow Display Project, Introduction to the Cheap Yellow
Display.
It is hosted by Trey and is about 4 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is a brief introduction to the Cheap Yellow Display.
Hello again, this is Trey.
Several months ago, I heard Paul Acidorian mention the Cheap Yellow Display on his podcast,
Paul's Security Weekly.
I didn't think much about it at the time, but then I heard it referenced again and again.
Then finally it was described and I became interested.
Cheap Yellow Display is the term used for the ESP32-2432S028R.
That's a mouthful. Let's try that again.
ESP32-2432S as in Sierra.
ESP32-2432S028R is in Romeo.
Since this is somewhat challenging to say and to remember for that matter, and since the board is yellow and it can be obtained for as little as 12 US dollars, it has been given the nickname Cheap Yellow Display.
I will abbreviate this as CYD that's Charlie Yankee Delta for the remainder of this episode in the show notes.
It is an ESP32 with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on a development board.
With one or more USB connectors, a microSD slot, a limited selection of GPIO pins, an RGB LED, a speaker, a light sensor, and best of all a 2.8 inch that's 71 millimeters for our metric folks, TFT touchscreen LCD display.
The Cheap Yellow Display runs on 5 volts DC. I'm including some photographs of the Cheap Yellow Display in my show notes.
Random Nerds Tutorials has produced a very good write-up about this board on their website. Link is in the show notes.
Brian Locke, aka WitnessMeNow, has been building a community for the Cheap Yellow Display on his GitHub site.
Also, link in the show notes, where he has instructions, examples, tutorials, downloadable tools, and much more.
Beginning way back in the 1970s, my father and I built electronics projects together, and I have had a love for doing so ever since.
Over the last few years, I have built several Arduino-based gadgets on different platforms, including a couple which run on breadboards sitting beside me on my desk.
Here's a little bit of a sneak peek. I will share more about one of those in a future episode.
Alright, back to this one. A common use for the Cheap Yellow Display among hackers is to leverage the built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios to compromise wireless networks or devices.
The Marauder Project is a pre-built image that can be loaded directly to the Cheap Yellow Display to use it as a wireless hacking tool.
Frank Fletcher's GitHub Repository, whose link is in the show notes because Frank is spilt with a four instead of an A, but anyways, the link is in the show notes.
Frank Fletcher's GitHub Repository is one place where you can download the Marauder Tool.
There are also video games, clocks, photoslide shows, and more, which have already been coded for you and are available on the internet for download.
What would you build with a Cheap Yellow Display? What could you build? What problem might you want to solve? What fun project might you come up with?
For myself, the Cheap Yellow Display intrigued me, but it did not yet jump out at me as something I had a need for. Yet.
What would change my mind? What would set me on a quest to obtain some of these devices and learn to develop code for them? What problem did I wish to solve?
Tune in again in a couple weeks to learn the answers to some of these questions and more in my next episode for this HPR series. Goodbye.
