A compliment somewhat often paid from one host to another on Hacker Public Radio is that
they could listen to that person read the phone book.
So today on a very special episode of Hacker Public Radio, we are proud to present exactly
that.
Hello, this is Ahuka and I am coming to you with a dramatic reading of the yellow pages
for the Ann Arbor Michigan USA area and I'm going to be looking at the home improvement
and remodeling.
That starts with Aravier Hardware Floors.
Atlas Gutter Helmet Oh, gutter Helmet, I wonder what that is.
B&B Construction Company, I guess they build bed and breakfasts, Belanger builders,
for all your construction needs, Blooms RC Contractor, Bob Banky Company, Bratcher Electric,
Bretternitz Professional Services, that sounds so much better than the unprofessional services
we so often get, doesn't it?
Brian Family Construction LLC, Brian Robards Custom Homes, Bruce's Handie Man Services,
Oh, and they have an ad, Bruce's Handie Man Services, free estimates, owned and operated,
fully insured.
What's a Handie Man service that's not owned and operated?
I'm not quite sure.
No job is too small for Bruce's Handie Man service, they have 32 years of experience and
they do basement remodeling, kitchen bath remodeling, drywall, carpentry, plumbing, electrical,
flooring and ceramic tile.
So it sounds like they can pretty much handle any problem you have.
So remember, Bruce's Handie Man service, which I guess is great if you're in this area.
Here in Dexter Michigan, Berks Roofing, which is apparently not quite the same as Berks
Roofing Repairs.
So I wonder are these brothers in competition with each other?
I have no idea.
C, M, B, Kitchens and Baths, I guess they're going to be anonymous here, Cadia Outdoor Services,
Carver Construction, Catilio Tile Service, Chelsea Antiques, and I guess for remodeling
you might have a need for some antiques to spruce up the place, Clark Home Improvement,
Comfort Shure Insulation LLC, Comprehensive Building Services LLC, Conquer Construction,
I guess they beat your problems into submission.
Construction Connection Company, Corbin Builders, Chroma Building and Roofing, CTS Construction,
serving the Washington County and Ipsilanti area.
Well, Ipsilanti is in Washington County, so that is somewhat redundant to say that.
Ipsilanti Michigan, it's right next to Ann Arbor, but Ann Arbor is what most people
have heard of.
If they've heard of anything in Michigan at all.
Cutting edge drywall, Dave Rasmussen is the owner of that, and he says new construction,
additions, commercial, residential, interior metal studs, drop ceiling, insured quality
workmanship since 1994.
Then there's Deedler Building Company LLC, and they have two offices.
That's always a sign of success.
DeMarco's Home Improvements, DeMOS and Sons, diversified building services incorporated,
which is not at all the same as diversified roofing.
Now diversified roofing, they have an ad here, and it says, quality, keeping you covered,
it's not only our logo, it's our motto, free estimates, commercial, residential, we specialize
in roofs and roofs only.
Family owned and operated over 16 years experience, we take pride in our work and our company.
Well, it certainly sounds like a place you'd want to do business with, doesn't it?
Then there's Dunright Contracting, Dream Safari Construction, Duco Home Services, EMH
Improvements, and they've got a couple of offices here, so they're doing well.
Concert Home Services, Expressions Design Center, Extra Care Incorporated, Forster Construction
Company, Four Seasons Sunrums, oh four season sunrums, let's see what they have to say.
Conservatories and sunrums, introducing the new hybrid sunrum.
One shudders to think what a hybrid sunrum is.
All for your free in-home estimate, visit our showroom with full-size displays.
So if you're in the market for a four season sunrum, obviously you would want to contact
four season sunrums.
Well, that's probably more of this than anyone should ever have to sit through, so this
is a hookah signing off.
Today I am reading to you from Compact Modular Tees for Semitic Encryption, it is a
site-gen article, abstract.
Unified efficient theory have led to many key advances, including by Zananti, thought tolerance
and e-business.
In our research, we proved the investigation of XML, which embodies the theoretical principles
of electrical engineering.
In order to solve this question, we demonstrate that through clean, adaptive algorithm for
investigation of IPv6 by J. Don Guerra, runs in Q, or in infinity, log, log, log, phase,
log, log, log, time, IPv4, and evolutionary programming in cooperation to surmount this
riddle.
Now I am going to leave you something to do.
If you decode what I am just saying now, you will can fall in the show.
Goodbye.
