This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4,325,
Prophide the 28th of February 2025.
Today's show is entitled,
Two Software I Use Futo Keyboard and Anoriter.
It is part of the series' app Spelling King.
It is hosted by Semla's M. St. Louis,
and is about 14 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is an Android keyboard and an online feed reader, both free.

I want to recommend two pieces of software I use,
one cloud-based, and the other an app for Android.
First, the Futo Keyboard, FUTO Keyboard.
How is it?
One, it's officially an alpha, but it's solid,
and I've been using for weeks without any problem.
Two, the Magical STT,
a beautifully working speech-to-text.
It needs a download, easily indicated in the app,
and you can download there, choose the file in the app,
and then delete the downloaded,
because when you indicate a file within the app,
it incorporates and you can then delete what you downloaded.
It's a simple file to allow the text,
the speech-to-text in your language, in any language.
Another Magical Number 3,
Swipe-to-type, or swipe-typing is the correct name.
You know what it is.
You swap the finger in the screen to the characters,
and it gets the word.
Magic.
For the Magical No Internet Access,
it's a selling point of the app.
Even though it's free,
I may call a selling point saying that they say no Internet permission.
That's true, you can check it easily,
because it's technical.
It's not to blow a wage boost away.
It's what it is.
And the Magical, so much Magical, huh?
Number 5 now, or 6, I don't know.
It's not numerated, numbered.
It's not numbered in my script.
But any language, that's the Magical.
I am a native Brazilian Portuguese person,
also using it for English and for a little French.
And all is very, very fine,
with the same good precision,
for speech-to-text, for swipe,
for suggestion of words.
This last one is the unique point
that I think loses to Gboard,
the keyboard from Google.
But it is very OK.
This was, how is it now, why it?
Or why it for you?
If you want an advanced keyboard,
with features like word prediction,
to help correct typos,
and even more Magicals,
but it's not content for any reason,
with Gboard or other keyboard,
or would be OK to change,
try something new,
even if for the sake only of
no internet permission for your typing tool,
that's it, that is why.
Cons.
There is not really a con,
but it does not seem a legitimate review
or recommendation if I don't put something.
So, in the table I put,
the word prediction is not very good.
It does not gas my intentions so magically.
So, I have to type more.
Then I had two.
Then I had to type in the keyboard
from Google, for example,
that new, all my words,
from before I typed more.
But with Foto,
it's not so magical in this guessing the word.
Another con, I found the appearance is strange at first.
The special characters in gray indicated in each key
are at the very extreme of the upper right corner.
Siemens unpolished,
worse than the one I was using,
the extremely simplistic simple keyboard
that has a nice design.
But after the second or third day of use of Foto,
I don't even perceive it.
I don't notice.
It is beautiful to my eyes now.
Maybe I would strange if I change back to something
because of this placement
of the indication of the special characters in gray
at the very upper right corner.
But when you're using,
you customize fast.
And third con,
contrary point,
I would say the swiping backspace behavior
didn't delete entire words, only characters.
Then I have to waste more time to delete.
But before finishing the script,
I double-checked.
Double-checked and the option is there.
Backspace behavior when holding swiping.
There is the delete characters,
or I marked now delete entire words.
It's right under the app menu.
Keyboard and typing.
Long press keys and space bar.
That's the placement.
You can check later on the script
if you want to find this option.
I will repeat how you change from deleting characters
or deleting entire words when you keep pressing the backspace
or swipe backspace.
It is the app menu.
Keyboard and typing.
Under that option,
long press keys and space bar.
It seems a little confusing to go too long in the menu,
too far there in various ways,
but no, it's not confused.
You can get a custom-made fast.
Where to get it?
At Play Store.
More info at
keyboard.futo.org.
I didn't test only Futo.org,
but the correct address,
keyboard.futo.futio.org.
Second software and last one,
InnoReader.
InnoReader.
Oh, together.
How is it?
What it is?
First, it's a simple and beautiful interface
for reading RSS, reading feeds.
Number 2.2 of what is it?
Three, no ads.
Up to 150 feeds.
Can you use your podcasts, you ask?
Yes, but without any audio option
on the listening interface,
embedded, embedded.
I checked this pronunciation before
I don't know if I remember correctly,
but I think this is how you
pronounce embedded.
You can't so change the speed
or do anything you would do
on the advanced audio player
or podcast player specifically,
but you can use to check for podcasts.
I'm using to aggregate everything in a place,
but it's better to then download,
for example, the audio that you see there,
and then playing the VOC like I do,
and I recommend this one.
It's the safe option,
open-source, and all around for media.
But talking about VOC is beyond this show.
Another point, number 3.
In Pro plan only,
sorry, it's number 4.
No, number 3.
Yeah, in Pro plan only,
that is only pegging.
You can filter the speeches of news
you want to appear on the feed,
by word or outer,
or the text that appears
in a certain content of certain feed
or certain feeds.
I haven't tested, it's paid,
but for example,
I'm happy to be subscribed
to all comments here of the radio,
but one could use this paid feature
to follow comments only for his own shows
or her own shows on HPR
by filtering, by hostname or show number.
It's a nice resource for that.
And optionally, there is an Android app
that I never tried.
So, I can't say anything about that.
Only checking that there is an app
if you don't want to choose your browser
and go to innoreader.com.
Why it?
I don't know for you.
For me, I wanted to not receive
emails for news.
I listened to a show here in Hacker Public Radio
that talked about our RSS feeds.
I even commented on that show
that I was subscribed to newsletter
for my mail,
but then I decided to give feeds
a chance again,
because even though they are so advanced
and so out of time,
I'm not anachronic,
but it's not from the past
but not vinculated to time.
They are presently,
they are past, present, and future.
They are immune to time.
They are utile.
And I am liking to be a guy of feeds again.
We are so vinculated,
so addicted to what algorithms
put to us like what they post
in the feed of Facebook, Instagram,
Google News or another aggregator.
No, you can subscribe to the feeds
of what you want to see.
That's great.
That is great.
And I even prefer the option
to not get recommendations.
Cino Reader recommends by default
if you want to see recommendations,
but I prefer to see what I want
to see what I choose to see.
Not what an algorithm
or anything
that is not seeking my best interest,
of course, once meet to see,
but what I choose consciously
are not so consciously to get.
And this is all about RSS feed,
everything you follow aggregated
by the order you want,
chronological,
it's the most default,
but anyway, you want.
And I used,
Killed the newsletter,
that is,
Killed an iPhone,
the iPhone newsletter.com,
to get subscribed to sources
that does not have a feed,
only email newsletter.
And even the Supreme Court
of Brazil does not have the option
of RSS,
it only has newsletter
for its decisions,
for its documents
of information,
the informatics,
but it's,
it's resolved very quickly
and easily with the free Killed
the newsletter.
I know there is another site
of, with this name,
so I will repeat,
the one I used
and can recommend it's,
Killed iPhone,
the iPhone newsletter.com.
Why?
I chose Aino Reader,
apart from all these things,
all these,
the navigation,
all these turning around,
the point,
well,
I wanted to be able to read
anywhere,
in my notebook,
or mobile phone,
in a good interface,
without giving much information
to register,
surely without ads.
And came to Aino Reader,
fortunately.
You need to explore a bit,
the options,
if you want,
to perfect the interface,
to your test,
but no worries in it.
Camps,
contrary points,
sorry,
I can't find one,
only if I invent
the defect
of not being full-fledged,
to list into podcasts,
but it is not mean for it,
so it's not a con
of an RSS reader.
Where to get,
or to access it,
in ainoreader.com.
As always,
but never said,
feedback is welcome.
About the content,
the production,

my comment here,
in a GPR site,
on this site,
on this episode,
or by mail,
as you want,
if you want.
Goodbye.
There was that one,
with you,
goodbye.
