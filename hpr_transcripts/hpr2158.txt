Hello hacker public radio Brian Inohio here I want to record an episode for a couple
of reasons, first and foremost, it's because I know HPR is low on shows and thought I
told my head into the ring and help the project out.
The other reason is I've been inspired by some of the recent past episodes, Clotus, tabletop
gaming, baking chop chip cookies, changing oil, making coffee, just episodes that are not
strictly computer based which is kind of fun to hear and I enjoy them.
So I thought I'd throw one in and it's about an activity that my wife and I have been
involved with for maybe a couple of years now I guess and it's called Art Club and Art
Club is an activity where we hack our knowledge about art and the little background on that
growing up I didn't learn anything about painting, sculptures, pottery, art in any sense or form.
This wasn't part of our world growing up and so I'm pretty ignorant about the subject
of art in the world and so Art Club is a way for myself, my wife and our friends to learn
more about art, to hack our knowledge about art and to for me to appreciate art in a way
that I've never been able to before so I'm glad that we do it.
So how do you do an Art Club simple?
You need two things to do in Art Club, you need another person, a minimum of one other
person, although the more the merrier, we do it with, we're up to, it's about eight of
us now four couples and you need an Art Museum, it access to an Art Museum.
Now here in Toledo, Ohio where I live I'm very fortunate we have a world class Art Museum
that has beautiful permanent exhibits and a lot of really great traveling exhibits that
show up and so we're very fortunate it's a great Art Museum and if you have an Art Museum
in your community that makes it easier but I think that you could do Art Club even
with online, there's plenty of Art Museums that have their collections or pictures of
their collections online and so be a, I don't think that having an Art Museum where you live
is a necessity but it definitely is helpful and so this is how Art Club goes.
What we do is we go to the Art Museum and Art Museum is divided into rooms and we started
out by going into different rooms and picking a picture, a piece of pottery, a sculpture
in that room and then what you do is you go and you research that piece of art and then
on Art Club day, the actual day we get together, we present our research and this is the
best part of it because you learn not only about the piece of art, you learn about other
artists, you learn about different types of art, you learn about art history, you learn
about world history and you learn what is interesting to your friends and so you get
to know your friends even better and so it's a lot of fun, we usually share a meal during
the time that we talk about our pieces of art and then after the meal, after we've all
presented our things and we've discussed it, we go back to the Art Museum and we pick
another room and we do it again and so we try to meet once a month, it probably works
out to more like eight or ten times in the year that we get together, schedules are sometimes
hard to connect but also we've sort of we've moved from just doing strictly rooms to move
to subject matters, an example of that was we did a subject matter of animals and you had
to pick a piece of art that had an animal in it and then you reported on it and the reports
were all over the place, some people focused on the artists, some people focused on the
type of art because there were sculptures and stuff that involved and some people talked
about the animals that were in the art, it was really fascinating and I learned a lot
and now what I've noticed over the course of our time of doing art club is I can go into
an art museum and I really do appreciate the art more, I appreciate the beauty and the
work involved with producing a piece of art and the message behind it so it's been a great
learning experience and I think that hacking and hacker public radio, that's what it's
about, it's about learning about new things, testing your limits, going maybe outside
of your comfort zones and learning about new things so I would encourage all of you to
find a friend and start an art club in your community and have fun with it and learn
about the beauty that comes from people creating things, so from Toledo Ohio I'd like to sign
