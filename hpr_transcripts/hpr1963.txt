And I'm jumping the gun a little here, but while we've got an interlude, we're coming
up on to 1 a.m. Zulu and Greetings to Cape Verde.
Some regions of Greenland, and I don't know why all these things say one more.
We said that last year, we're going to go and find out who one more was.
Preyay, I'm destroying these, Polta del Gata in the Azores.
That's got somebody must have hit the keys or something.
If I cannot pronounce what that is, and Mendello.
Okay.
Happy New Year to you tonight.
Yes.
I think it's...
I mean, what I find interesting, actually, is somebody from the UK to go with this time
then, is that she is.
A few cases behind the UK and I, which you just mentioned, we don't know when we think
of that.
And also in the summer, when we got better summer time, it's actually an hour, it's
actually an hour.
It's an hour.
She had back an hour, just pull the temps in, which I think it interesting as well.
Oh, that never occurred to me.
At least in the Southern hemisphere, I didn't, yeah, they're, if they do, you know, daylight
savings time, then they would be on a different clock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And there was that as well.
That's the third thing.
The rest of the saying is, but in the UK, it goes to summertime, so you go now ahead.
The Iceland does not have a change of clocks, so when it's summertime here, there wasn't
there.
Okay, it's 2016 here now.
So I went in 2014 in May, which I'm back now, just pull the temps in, which I thought was
a bit interesting.
But also, I think it's interesting actually as well as how, yeah, because of the whole
daylight savings time thing.
If you're in New Zealand, or if it was, because America and small, or something, that decided
to live in the last time zone, right last.
So they became the first, even for New Zealand.
So, whole 24 hour day thing, doesn't really apply at this time of year.
Because all the daylight savings was 26th.
We had to hold the show within 26th hour before as well.
And this is going to be way far afield, but it just occurred to me the other day.
If Game of Thrones actually takes place on a Dyson spear, as it seems to in the beginning
sequence, which probably has nothing to do with.
If you had assuming they are orbiting an artificial sun, because if there's a real sun, it would
never go dark anywhere.
But if it was, if they're orbiting an artificial sun that gets turned on and off at night,
then every place in Game of Thrones would have the same time zone.
All right.
Well, Game of Thrones, that's one of the setting where he saw the first series.
And that was a few years back when they decided to show it on the sky one channel there,
trying to get people to go and stay at Lenta, for sure.
We'd be like, there's actually shows football on some of the main footballs around here.
And stay on the challenge.
And I just get people and stay at sports.
But that's what they do here.
They actually catch up a long phone, because there are DVDs around here.
Is that actually some kind of theory that they're in a Dyson sphere?
I thought the beginning was just supposed to look cool.
I didn't know that that was an actual thing.
I've heard that advance before.
It doesn't look big enough to be an actual planet.
Of course, we're only seeing what they're known world, I guess.
That has been suggested.
Like I said, I think that was completely a construct of the people doing the TV series.
We need somebody in here who's actually read the books to maybe see if that has it.
But if you look at it, what they show up in the sky sure does look like some sort of artificial sun as well.
The whole thing, mechanical and clockwork.
I have read the books.
I've only seen the first two seasons as well.
The clockwork, that's what it's meant to be, is basically clockwork.
The whole point of the game is it's different, powerful houses.
All trying to manipulate each other.
It's a big game.
They're all trying to manipulate each other and capture land and capture religions.
Take this castle from such and such and get such and such to bend the knee and bring your forces to mine.
That's all it is.
It's a big game.
It's a big game of a clockwork moving park.
That's the point of the intro sequence.
It's just lots of moving parks that are all interconnected.
If you capture such and such a person, you can move there.
Prinsling or something like that from the board.
You're going to force them to do what you want and then get allegiance for another one.
But if you capture them and if you accidentally kill them, then if they're alive,
the younger son of such and such are there, the throne for such and such.
That's what it is.
It's basically a number of families all trying to play each other for the Iron Throne.
It's just like clockwork as a game.
That's what the intro sequence is.
And probably a lot like the real world they show that no matter what happens
and all these wars and stuff that the peon type people keep dying in,
things for them aren't going to change no matter who's running it.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Because the only thing that matters in these is the high bottoms.
There's all the laws and the ladies and the barons.
I don't know if there's barons actually.
It's those people.
And that was why, initially, when I was reading the books,
I found them quite hard to actually read because I'm essentially a Republican,
not an American sense, but I'm a Republican.
So I find all this burn, scrape into the lords and ladies and all that.
And I found that repulsive.
And it's also why I struggled to read the Lord of the Rings as well,
because that whole world was very deferential to kings and queens and lords and all that kind of stuff.
And for the same reason, I find that quite hard to get into as well.
Well, so what's the real world?
Well, true.
But maybe we've at least got enough democracies or systems that don't rely on absolute monarchies
so that you can kind of exist on some plane and still do different things
and let these people exist on theirs.
And, you know, I'm just going to...
We'll never, never let you in me meet, you know.
What I did find interesting about the Game of Thrones,
is I mean, distort the books, sorry, the TV series from what I've seen.
I've only seen Season 1 and 2 so far.
But it is very, very accurate to the books.
I mean, I'll stand how accurate it was to the books.
And that made me think, well, actually, there's some other stuff that's coming up later on in the books.
Like, I've seen Clips of Season 5, and I'm like, oh, I know what that is.
Just by that wee clip, I know exactly what that is, because I've read it.
I don't know what book it was in, but I've read it.
I know what happens with that character, so I can picture that now.
And it looks like...
I don't see that they've kept very close to the books for Season 1 and 2.
I've got to assume that they'll be keeping quite close to the books for the other seasons that I haven't seen yet.
And, yeah, I mean, that is good.
That is a very good Game of Thrones, I hope you say, is very good.
Well, I've only seen Season 2.
As I've caught up with the box, it's later on.
And then it was removed for the box, so it's waiting until March or so and it comes back.
I think the TV producers are hoping George R. Martin will suddenly have an incredible burst of speed riding,
because I'd understood they were about to catch up with the last book he's written.
My understanding having not read the books and just watched the TV show is that the show has run out of books.
So, at this point, and the further along it has gone, it has diverged further and further from the books to where the author has told the showrunners what the ending is.
But, basically, from this point on, they're going to do it their way and he's going to do it his way.
And they'll end up at the same place, but how they get there may be a little different.
Star Wars, when I put this one, but hey, that would be fun to really have the style of discussion anyway.
I think off-hand, that was one of those things where I was watching two or three different shows,
one episode at a time, can I gradually work through them?
And then I happened to stumble across the newsroom.
I mean, everything that's thrown out the window, and it's got to go.
It just consumed me.
And everyone was burned at that point.
I've got to go back and start guarantee things.
And then, of course, there's a big Star Wars, thinking about Sky movies, where the Clone Wars, for every season of the Clone Wars, is in it there.
And every season of Rebels, both seasons of Rebels is in there.
So, I've been going back through them, and everything's thrown aside for that,
before I'm getting back in the other stuff.
And there's only enough hours in the day.
I haven't watched Clone Wars other than a little bit.
And I've watched all of Rebels, I think, up to this point.
It starts off really rough, but it is really good where they're at now.
It's remarkably good. I was actually surprised.
Is there any legitimate way to stream Rebels anywhere?
I haven't seen it yet at all.
I get it through my cable.
We just use our cable log-in to go to the Disney site and watch it there.
So, I know that's a legitimate way of doing it.
Well, that's kind of a minute.
Even when I had cable in town, that was one of the services I didn't get.
It's coming around.
Of course, I've mentioned on Linux Logcast, you've got both Showtime through Hulu,
and actually you can get Showtime through Amazon Prime now as well, for about the same price.
And I looked at my old Showtime app I had from when I had cable.
They're not showing all the movies that are on Showtime the channel on, quote, Showtime on Hulu.
I may switch to Prime and see if it's different.
Of course, then you've got HBO, which is completely all a cart at its own Internet service.
And Stars is now on Amazon Prime for like nine bucks a month.
I think the only thing on there that I would really be jonesing for is the Evil Dead series.
There's other things I would watch like Scottish Lady going back in time series,
but I think that's more of a chick deal than I don't want to offend anybody saying that.
I do think that series obviously is written for a strong female lead for the ladies to watch.
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's other stuff on Stars I wouldn't mind, but for one series I'm not going to pay nine bucks a month yet.
And that's a lot of things like the Disney where you got kids ties.
Of course, you're probably watching Disney all the time anyway, but just for one thing I'm not going to subscribe to service.
But the point I'm getting to, I bet within a year or two years on the outside,
we'll be able to get everything, be able to subscribe to every premium service through the Internet that you can get on a cable subscription.
I mean, it's obvious the rats are leaving the ship.
Yeah, I mean, for me, I've seen the first eight or so episodes of Rebels.
Doesn't quite grab me yet.
I don't know why, maybe it's the characters, just a bit too annoying, I don't know.
I have seen bits and pieces ahead.
I think at one point it was a soak up turned up.
And I was like, oh, cool, I forgot all about her.
Last thing I knew from her for the Clone Wars.
Well, I liked her so much.
And then she was on the run out of the order for modern things like that.
And I was like, what happened to her?
She was one of the big main characters in the Clone Wars.
What happened to her?
And then she turns out like ten years down the line as a Clone woman now.
Sort of in as a Rebel contract.
And then that to me is interesting in the Clone Wars.
Where I'm looking at what happened to the big name characters from the Clone Wars.
When you be sort of having to grieve us, to Duku, to Sidious, to Canoe, to Skywalker,
to all these characters, but the ones I'm thinking line.
What happened to a surge of interest?
How does she, how does she die?
I don't remember ever seen anything where she actually died.
I know Duku turned on her and then she went back to Bathamia, but she never actually died.
So it's one of those things where the big characters from the big war, like ten, fifteen years beforehand,
do they turn up on the Clone Wars and revels like a soak at this?
I thought a soak, I never saw the episodes from the very end of Clone Wars,
but I thought a soak had died in the last season.
Well, I want a season, the end of season five now.
And that's the point where, again, I'm binge watching this.
So that's the point where she is.
Well, I mean, I've watched most of these before, that this was round about the point where I've lost track of it.
So I'm kind of getting to get to the new stuff now, but the stuff that I haven't seen before.
And I don't remember, I've certainly not seen a soak up being dying in the Clone Wars,
but she definitely turns up on rebels.
And there's one point in rebels, so I've seen it on YouTube.
I've not seen the episode yet, where there's some part about where she realises the Anakin of the Vader as her old master.
Yeah, having not seen Clone Wars and not really knowing who the character was until she showed up and read about her and she was in Clone Wars,
she did not die.
She's alive and well in rebels.
And she's kind of a main character in the second season.
She's not in every episode, but she's kind of their connection to the rebellion proper.
She sort of gives them their missions almost.
She's kind of like their commander, which is kind of cool.
Okay, maybe it was something like they ran a plot line where they thought she was dead or something and she turns back up.
I don't know.
I remember in rebels, there was three or four episodes where there kind of sneakily talk to someone that you never see who it is, you never hear it is.
And she's got some code name or something.
And then one of the episodes, she turns up and that's the person that Kane and I've been talking to.
And it's always a super.
So she's surrounded then.
Excellent. She's surrounded.
But of course, at that point in time, she can't show that she's a Jedi because as soon as she brings a light sailor out,
then she's identified as a Jedi and the Jedi are the blame for the war and all that kind of stuff.
And I also thought, but maybe it's another one of her of her race, but I thought they killed her off in one of the missions of battlefront as well.
Battlefront, too, rather.
You know, there's a point in that where they show the clone troopers and after they've been ordered to turn on the Jedi.
And that is another to go on the council at some point.
So it could have been, huh?
I don't know.
No, you're probably right there because it shows a adult in that mission.
Yeah, there is definitely another to grow an adult to grow a woman on the council.
She's not there that much, but yeah, she is sort of on and off.
So it's probably her that you see.
I think as well that you know that feeling that if you only ever watch the movies,
you get that kind of feeling seeing if there's a truth when the other comes in.
And there is the night sees lightsaber against Duke and if the only thing you watch is the movies,
then you've got that kind of the happy racing moments.
Yes.
Finally, we're getting some some get a real real master of a lightsaber because it's actually going to be fantastic.
And that I've realized that kind of feeling as if you read,
if you're into the expanded universe, the Clone Wars kind of gives you that kind of thing as well.
And whereby you know, I mean, for me, it's Luminara and Dolly.
So she turns up.
She is one of the best lightsaber drillers in the order.
So it's kit first though.
And kit first though gets a really sure the deal on episode three really does.
But yeah, actually see them properly in action that gives me that same kind of thing.
It's like, yes, finally we're getting to see a master with a lightsaber.
And I don't care what people say.
I think kit first though did get a rodeo on episode three.
He's meant to be one of the best swordfighters in the order.
And I do know who kit first though is in episode three.
It's been a while since I've watched the prequels.
Right.
Kit first though.
Remember the full Jedi that go to arrest the chance or base window in three other masters?
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Right. He's one of them.
He's the not only with the green sort of headdails.
So when Sidious is a treason then and jumps into the forum takes a couple of swipes
and takes two of the masters out without even a blink of an eye.
So it's him.
It's nice window and kit first though.
It's left.
Kit first though manages to get a couple of blocks.
And then he's he's taking care of and then it's just Sidious and nice window.
And I was like really really.
I mean, seriously, he's he's meant to be one of the best the best fighters in the order.
And it was taken out by like a couple of swipes like seriously.
He was he was so that I just felt like it first though is like he was so wrong.
He was so so wrong.
It didn't get a part of an episode two as well.
He was the one in the in the middle of the battle on G and also he was the one forced push three PO.
On his back and then he lost his head and stuff like that.
And that's Kit first though as well.
But at least it was actually fighting and at least it was and and the thick of it.
But going out like that, they said this.
That was just pure social.
Well, I mean, you watched the movie and had any of them keep up with Yoda because he's just like a ping pong ball with a lightsaber.
Yeah, true.
True.
I say, I mean, you're those one of these kind of guys that he can I can identify as all your options because you're only options go more.
Because if you go if you go even mid, you're not going to get them.
So you've got to keep going low.
But it doesn't it doesn't qualify has attack.
You can go mid low, mid or high and sort of jump around at the same time.
So yeah, can I know is that your options when you're fighting him?
I mean, I would I would think you're even against the general grievous griefs be like, oh holy shit, you know?
Well, in the revenge of the surf novel, excuse me, the reason why Kenobi has sent to grievous is that Kenobi has no style.
He's just one of these guys that's able to one of these Jedi that's able to just relax and be formless and let the force control.
Whereas everyone else in the order has a style, even you know, that has a style.
They've all got styles that are developed to sort of maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses and all that.
And grievous learns these styles very, very quickly.
Once they start fighting them, he learns these styles very, very quickly and he can adapt.
So if you've got a style, if you've got any of the Jedi that I've got a style, grievous, all it needs to do is hold out long enough to figure you out and then he's nailed you.
Whereas Kenobi has no style, that's why he was sent.
And welcome to the channel, Zizka, if I'm pronouncing that right.
Yeah, well, on that note, that's 25 first one and I'm struggling to keep my eyes open here.
So I shall bid you all to you, it's been wonderful.
So happy new year to all one and all and yeah.
And I shall catch you some more time.
Hey, this web, you're always welcome to come on the and always entertaining on the Hacka Public Radio New Year's show.
And I was going to say, yeah, I just, this is what's going to be coming up.
So before I go, good evening, happy New Year.
And a happy New Year. Give me two seconds. The sound settings are not right.
Everyone's sensible distorted.
Yeah, we're all doing the weather impressions here.
You're missing the equalizer's missing out the heavy breathing.
Give me a sec here.
Keep talking.
That's no, we're not talking on Darth Vader's breathing.
Darth Vader trying to put stuff he's done up through a straw. That's what that is.
How are you, January Gordon? Good to see you.
What you can see me?
I can see you right there.
Oh, right, actually, yeah, I was just, I was just on my way out and then I saw you come into the channel.
I thought, oh, I'll just tighten around for a few more minutes.
So I can say hello.
Yeah, well right, how are you?
Hi.
No bother, at all. No complaints.
I kept on the go.
Oh, carry is here. That's interesting.
Where's my name there?
Who's headed?
I'll need to get back together and mumble on a week's chat with the crew and some time in the
new year.
I'll ask that I've meant to reply to your email and then I thought I'd done it and then
I'll turn it over to that and I'll bring it up to date in a few days.
I guess maybe even tomorrow I'll do that email and then I want to get together for the
chat on mumble and see if they were going with that.
Hi.
I'm very good.
I can know I'm just actually glad you're okay because I'm doing an ending from you.
I was like, mm-hmm.
No, you seem concerned on Twitter.
Hmm.
Something's wrong.
But no, it was Caroline that said to me you were up.
Hi, because she had emailed the same sort of run of it the same day as you had.
No, I just went in a dark for a while.
I'll explain, but yeah, I lost interest in a lot of stuff really.
But yeah, I didn't know about bringing it in and I was down.
Anyway, and I was going to leave just before you turned up.
I was just saying, look at buys and then I saw you coming in.
I'll stick it in for a few minutes, but I really should be going.
That's terrible.
Have you got a party to go to the night as young?
Yeah, well, you know what I'm not.
It's young for some people.
It's only, it's, it's half past one in the afternoon in Australia.
Not that I'm there.
But yeah, so I'm going to go and I'll bid you all happy New Year again and catch you
the next time.
Right.
I'm having a log off and log back on because my sound is all over.
It's also really distorted.
So I'm going to try a log off log back on.
Well, for what?
It's worth you sound.
You sound a car, are you Kevin?
I was calling one of them.
Yeah.
Do we sound any better now?
I call it.
Oh, perfect.
That's better.
I don't know what the difference was, but just it sounded really just wobbly and distorted.
I was thinking I could make out what people are saying, but it was just kind of odd.
We are.
Yeah, that's, that's what, that's what makes the hacker community so good.
You're all actually great to listen.
It's my first time here, actually.
This is the first time I've made the New Year episode, but it's only because it's the first time in a few years
I've actually been at home with a new episode.
You know, when you're going visiting somebody you can't really start saying, oh well,
thanks for having me, but see you later.
I'm off to join the HPR, guys.
Yeah, that's pretty much true.
I don't know, you might remember my nick, or recognize it.
I may remember it.
I may remember it.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
I think it's the first time I've ever spoken to you, but as far as voice, actually,
I can remember, obviously, spoken to you for a dance on that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The first time I'm on a podcast, anyway.
It wasn't just something I didn't care.
We were in there.
So where are you?
And then I was thinking, where do you go?
Change the status.
And then you left.
I don't know where are the people.
And then I was thinking, oh, maybe I should sign up on a...
Maybe I should sign up on a thing like a dance cow.
I come up with a call now.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Say to yourself.
So I did...
I'm not a random person now, actually.
Are you having fun on a new podcast?
I mean, because one of them needs to be on the skyish guys.
Yes, I have.
Made up them quite a few times.
In fact, the last time I was doing Glasgow, I stayed at his place.
No, I went to New York at the event.
So...
Yeah, I do.
And then in the next event, it's totally worth doing to in the UK, because there aren't many
anyway.
So, I'm not brilliant now.
It's kind of funny, because some people are trying to figure out who I was and stuff.
What?
Are you on Twitter?
No, I didn't really bother with social networking.
So I was...
Okay, no, we had somebody who...
Yeah, there was another one there.
It was just like a nickname on Twitter, and they came up to like an alliance.
Oh, hello, I'm so-and-so on a dog camp.
I was wondering if it was yourself, but no, it wasn't if you're not on Twitter.
No, no, I saw that before as well.
Because when I got a twist a year ago, there was like...
Somebody would have named me.
I was like, oh, okay.
We have to call myself something else then.
Oh, well, I must admit, there's actually a good community just now on GNU social.
I'm on FlagDev.
Some people are on Twitter.
The big difference is FlagDev looks like all the identical.
Quitter looks like Twitter, but it's also a limit.
It's quite short, but I think it's 300 characters.
Whereas FlagDev has a thousand limit characters.
I've yet to actually go over the thousand characters.
Ah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
FlagDev and there was this for this site as well.
I was really like looking for the after-after-of-the-old camp stuff
because there was always something that goes online.
And then I was like, oh, yeah, yeah.
Yes, there's a lot of sites.
Never actually sawing that.
And I could chat to somebody I chat to,
when the moon is light.
I could gather things to do really.
And I'm saying that one of the guys from,
it's kind of funny because that old camp,
okay, last year in 2015,
because he's coming here.
The guy who won the moon prize,
he, the big, the computer from,
yes or no.
I've played this for years on FlagDev.
Yeah, but I was shanning just before the battle
and I was like, oh, yeah, okay.
And my size is a joke.
And if you win, if you win,
if you win, you can do it to me.
So he's like, why would I come to you?
And then a battle happens
and somebody had a ticket called out
and they weren't there, so they would draw it.
And if you won it.
And of course, I was in a funny, in a way,
after a little joke,
where they pulled around.
Right, I don't know if this happened to him,
but he was really breaking up here.
He was breaking up really.
You were breaking up.
I missed pretty much the last end of that story.
Okay, I just said I was joking
with the person who won the prize
and he won the HPR people.
Just before the battle, I was joking about
if he'd won it and he actually won it.
That was it, really.
Yeah, I made up with Dave,
the last Glasgow pod crawl.
It was good to meet up with him, actually,
because I only spoke to him briefly before that.
It was actually, I made up with,
there was, obviously, it was myself
on McNally, but there was also
Dave Morris and Andrew Gregory, as well.
So it was a good night.
Yeah, my normally was, it was alright.
It was alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It wouldn't be from a podcast,
close-in too.
And then we went on to the,
then we came to Justin,
the Linux Royce podcast that they did
at the event as well.
Yeah, I gave him a real stick for that
because he mentioned Linux,
the Linux Royce podcast
like four times in their own podcast.
And I say, it's to flip and win to that podcast
and you didn't mention it.
We podcasted even once.
I was just joking, obviously, but I said,
I really did give him a stick for that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Talks down or something else I would say.
That's right, yeah, talks down, yeah.
Yeah, there used to be,
there used to be,
deviants enough
tolegal letharium,
top jam as well
but the favour of podcast is
generally flasures into music
if I'm listening things on my, so I've kind of been going off listening to that.
Well, there's the key thing, don't listen to anything, don't do anything else
while you're listening to TuxJump.
So what's anybody else enjoying this new year's night?
Not much, this seems to be the extent of it.
Anybody enjoying it?
Yeah, a nice tram or nice beer or nice wine or anything?
Oh, I'm on my second or third beer here.
Oh, well, I'm just having one or two Dalmour, who is just to be social now,
with a nice, nice tram for a year or so to have you.
Ah, I got a two-month-old at home, so if he wakes up, then, you know,
it's going to be a rough night if I have a couple of beers on me.
I remember the first, that was the thing I first and the last time I was rough as a dad,
especially when my kid was young, my first new year with him.
I was over at my neighbor's house for a party.
I got back in half for something like that, and then my kid was up.
I thought it was rough all day.
He was only two-month-old.
Yeah, I think I made the mistake once, and, you know,
where I just basically, I like had too much with dinner or something like that,
and my kid, I think, was probably with my daughter when she was really younger,
just kept me up most of the night, because she was one who had a hard time putting her down.
Like, I'm not sure whether just had something like in her ears like that,
but every time we put it later down into her crib,
she would just start screaming like crazy.
So we had a lot of long nights walking with her.
I made the mistake of drinking too much on a night that she was really rough,
and never again, never again, horrible, horrible night that was.
Oh, yeah, you only do that once.
You really do learn, you know.
I was very, I was pretty much very dry after that,
if I could do maximum, that was it.
Right, I can't hear again.
So my phone was going off so bad,
oh, because we changed our numbers, so if they're only cool,
but there's probably something we actually want to see get hold of you,
there'll be nothing cool,
but she's showing the same extent,
because I'm going to have a public speaking group as well,
and I've been meaning to do one about the Microsoft scan call,
where they film up, and they say they're from Microsoft support,
and they'd basically try and trick you to either give you
your credit card number,
or to connect your computer and the rest of it.
And in those YouTube videos, I'm not sure,
but I had some before,
and I really, really had the number on my own time,
and I got so in that once,
because it was doing it so well,
pretending that my people's all barest,
and really screaming of death and the rest of it, you know.
And I want to do a speech about this kind of call,
where they're kind of joking stuff,
or like, stuff in another bit,
but that's so sad,
and I'm thinking maybe with some voice clips or something,
I don't know, but,
because I need to get a speech then,
another one then,
had this group in me,
and it could be a person with me to do it then,
because I found there were cool in seven minutes,
but I can't do,
get people an idea of what it's like,
and they,
it is actually funny to be the scammer,
if you know, back and viewers.
Yes.
Seb, can you do me a favor?
Can you turn your,
either turn your game down a little bit,
or just move the mic back just a little bit,
because it's just,
it's kind of overmodulating.
You can cut a little bit with me.
Are you?
Because what do you want me to turn down?
The mic.
Yes.
Please.
Yeah, you can try.
Either that or just kind of move the mic a little bit away,
it's just, it's, it's coming over very, very loud,
and it's very distorted.
Just take curiosity,
what is my levels like?
Uh, sounds pretty good.
Right, no, that's fine,
because I've just looked through just,
built up a new computer,
and I've got, uh,
I've just put Debian on it,
but obviously I haven't had a chance to tweak it properly.
I was playing a bit with the DL network,
so I was making sure.
I'm always weird because I like to record my own voice
and mumble them, play it back,
and think, oh, how does that go?
Yeah, I think the problem is,
Seb, Seb, Seb's not using a headset at all earlier.
So there is, uh,
he started out with a little bit of feedback,
but Seb, whatever you were doing at the beginning,
go back to doing that,
because, uh,
the, the feedback loop has got progressively worse.
Well, happy new year, everyone.
Is this a public month?
Happy new year.
Oh, wow, okay, hello.
It wasn't true.
I'm finding you very low.
Can you maybe turn up the volume?
Are we a bit on your mic?
Absolutely.
I'm actually going to disconnect Bluetooth.
Oh, is that on like your inner car?
Well, one thing's for sure.
You've not got any bandwidth,
and then if you're on Bluetooth.
Oh, yeah.
That's not working?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
It really is not working at all.
Uh, well, to be fair,
they've done some stuff.
I can now connect to my Bluetooth speakers,
but the Bluetooth headsets,
they'll connect,
but as soon as you try to use,
they're just basically,
it's like your all connection just,
you know, I mean, I know that
there's no wrong with headset,
because the work with the Android devices.
But I just love being a gullipag.
I put myself through this pain.
I got, uh,
I got the BQ E5
and, uh, sold off my Android headset.
So of course, I went into it,
freaking right.
Let's push myself to Ubuntu.
And for the most, actually,
it's actually quite usable,
but you miss a lot of things.
But the one thing that's not usable,
is I cannot use it in the car,
because the Bluetooth headsets just work.
And Zizka just,
just so you know,
yes, uh, what a server this was.
It is, yeah,
everybody's, uh,
more and welcome to join.
This is our, uh,
uh,
New Year's celebration
for hackerpublicradio.org,
but you should know,
this is going to be
re-broadcast as a podcast
on the hackerpublicradio.org website.
I don't know if this sounds better or not,
but, um,
can we just say about one of the Ubuntu phones,
a BQ E5, yeah?
No, the BQ E5.
No, there's the,
there's slightly new one, yeah?
Yeah.
Sadly, actually,
was one of the first people
was, you've, uh,
said earlier on that,
but the first people were,
the BQ E4.5,
to get one,
show commercial available phone,
or might, yeah,
that's the Buntu phone.
But I was also then the first people,
if not the first,
to actually lose that phone,
because I've been, um,
traveling,
traveling,
doing my,
come back,
traveling,
I saw the rest of it,
and then basically end up leaving
on the house drive,
but I'm not realizing yet
if I, um,
until much later,
and then it's gone.
That's less,
that was a bit annoying.
I've got the MISU phone as well,
which is, um,
which is pretty nice
when a Bendy phone.
September 2nd iPhone,
and they sent me the one color,
which has been gold,
not silver.
Well, I had to look at the 4.5,
because I got sent to the invite
for that to go for the first,
but when I looked at the specs,
I was there going,
there are two, two,
little,
and then when the,
the five came out,
I thought,
yeah, okay,
I'm willing to pay that for the extra.
I mean, it was only like a 20-year-old difference
or something,
it wasn't,
but it was a reasonable amount
of a,
a spec upgrade.
Yeah, I'll go for it.
Yeah, and then either,
so, um,
the 4.5 Bendy,
the HD one,
they're pretty much the same phone.
But let people debate, actually,
if like, if people can run this as,
they're making phone or not,
they're Bendy phone.
I mean,
if you can really run it,
as you're making phone for months.
And, you know,
what I've been doing,
it's actually just that,
first would that be,
who won my last,
and then,
the Maizu,
but I could do it,
because I'm actually running
loads and loads of different
Android apps and all rest of it,
so,
so yeah, it's funny.
It does cool,
it does cool,
it does text,
it can,
it can be on web pages.
It's fine, in that sense.
Nice synth phase,
nice operating system,
and, um,
we'll be interesting
when the actual convergence comes as well.
Yeah, well, I've been doing the same.
I mean, I've,
I've had it as my only phone
since, uh,
the beginning of July,
so, uh,
I've really run the deep end,
but that was my own choice.
You know, I mean,
I decided,
come and be,
be it,
be it,
be it,
be it great,
it's,
it's going to be my phone,
just to try it,
because I always thought,
I can always go back
and, like,
have a,
who I,
for relatively cheap,
if it's another disaster,
but, uh,
thankfully,
no, it hasn't been,
there's been,
obviously,
some things are miss,
but, uh, as far as I'm concerned,
it is actually,
if you're not into apps,
it's great.
If you're heavily into apps,
if you have to have,
what's up,
you have to have Skype,
you have to have,
obviously,
it's,
it's,
no,
forever,
but as far as,
yeah,
if you need,
if you want all the apps,
if you want to have this
and that and all that,
and,
or show them,
then who captures,
definitely,
not at this stage.
However, um,
do you,
do you,
or you're the phone
on the other hand,
which is,
again,
then,
it's based,
it's up there,
not for one of your people,
it runs
BTFS,
even,
has its file system,
it's got quailin,
there's the graphics,
and they go and then,
we're a compatibility layer,
and,
first thing I go,
I go around those as well,
so,
for the first thing I did,
is I,
I put those,
those Android apps on there,
and it worked really well,
and then I thought,
if I need to actually try
some of the native apps,
so,
I brought that,
um,
sort of December,
2014,
with the yellow tablet,
which I've not got,
because I've got some fun,
in my stressure at the moment,
or whatever it was,
but, um,
I got the phone anyway,
I put those Android apps on,
I know all the people
are now,
I see,
so,
told me,
right,
it needs to upgrade
the,
so-for-so-s on this phone,
because the,
the ship version is very old,
so I was like,
yeah, but I've only,
just got this phone,
I haven't done anything with your credit system,
so I'm just going to,
do my thing.
And so,
when I actually, um,
corrupted the phone,
because,
I'd,
let's say,
put all these Android apps on,
fine, it worked great,
but the second I,
for,
the second I thought I'd put a native app on,
actually made for,
this dual-lephone,
or so-off-less OS,
actually basically made my,
broke my phone,
it became black,
it became unusable,
and the reason for that,
is quite simply because,
the ship version was so old,
on the phone,
by the way,
that,
the version of Q,
or QT is,
some people were saying,
it's called Q,
actually,
what KDE runs as well,
it was so old,
the ship version,
that my apps just did not work,
well, that,
they just,
they basically corrupted
the whole operating system,
just because,
the apps were made for a later version of Q,
which was a little bit annoying,
but,
I wasn't playing around,
so,
no big deal.
The last debate,
as well,
it's the event-new thing,
event-new touch,
we also have
an Android Compacity Lab,
because I mean,
Tizen does it from Samsung,
and,
in a way,
they should do it,
and on the other hand,
they shouldn't.
Well, I just wanted to chime in earlier,
Seb, I heard you talking
about the Indian tech scammers,
how you were looking to,
yeah,
it also happens that I've trolled them quite a bit,
and also have an acquaintance
who has compromised
several other sites,
and,
uh,
also an intuitive VoIP script
that would have wore dialed in,
and play back a robot
that would talk to them
with pre-recorded clips,
so I probably might find him interesting.
That sounds great.
That sounds like
a feel-good message of the year.
Yeah, yeah,
he has a lot of recordings of,
you know, the Indian's game
very frustrated,
because they keep getting these callbacks,
and they can't disconnect the phone, so.
Well, he's got recordings of the scammers.
Uh, he can't.
I'm sure he does.
So, if I can, who?
Uh,
I can give you his contact information,
if you'd like.
Yeah, because I'm so sure you're going to do a speech,
if someone's heard about this,
and I need some kind of
content,
or something I could use in a way,
because people aren't going to understand,
that's why he's,
you know, he's just a people,
they know what abuse going to death,
and tell them average people there.
Um,
yeah, I'm sure he'd find it very interesting.
Oh, it's funny, one of my mates
had one of them go totally mad on the phone.
He obviously just hit a raw nerve with them.
They had, uh,
spooked up, and he had led them on for a while,
just to get them on the field,
led them on, led them on, wasn't.
And then he says,
says the guy says, uh,
well, he says,
I've got to ask before we continue.
This really had a raw nerve with the guy.
He says, uh,
what does Ganesh think of what you're doing?
I mean, you're clearly Indian.
And the guy says, yes,
yes, I happened.
Yes, he says,
what does Ganesh think you're what you're doing?
Ganesh is peaceful.
Ganesh is, you know,
this Ganesh is that,
uh,
there is no way Ganesh would agree
with you scamming elderly people
and vulnerable people into that money.
And a pound of the guy just lost it
with a piece of shit
just waiting at him to get in the phone.
Yeah, it's not just the Indians.
There's a lot of Nigerians
who seem to participate in that as well.
It's actually quite funny.
It looks to you so you can actually
really wind them up
because you can play really dumb.
And, you know,
absolutely,
you know, click,
click on the Windows button.
Oh, I don't know what that is.
Well, do you want me to click, you know,
and of course, now with a setup like mine,
I've got, I'm using the Mate desktop.
So, by click on the bottom left
to choose me my entire desktop.
You know, it's like,
oh, there's nothing like that here
and you can really wind them.
Yeah, yeah.
Like, if you've done well enough,
you get swallowing that on the phone.
In the end,
actually, that was,
I was good because
I had first person
and then they referred me to
the other person.
And then,
it would be none for that now.
Also, I even got called back
because I tangled up some work with this week.
And, um,
when they were,
when their polypink is computer is really
having problems.
I'm looking like,
get what they want to say this up.
So, they start getting my,
my credit card number.
So, at this stage,
I'm not even thinking what
were credit card number or debit card number
that maybe looks like.
So, I started doing like,
400,
400,
500, 600,
and they were like,
are you messing with me?
And I was like,
yeah, yeah.
You'd probably be doing
with trying to scan people
and so on and so on and so on,
maybe basically.
You can get credit card numbers
for testing purposes
from visa and mastercard,
feed it to the scammers
and it usually passes through their system.
And you can trick them
into thinking it's a legitimate payment.
I don't know if anybody ever saw
the blog post on this,
but I thought this was great.
We're going back maybe a bit,
I don't know,
three or four years,
really a while ago,
but somebody had one of these calls
and it was,
it was one of those, you know,
check and see how many viruses
computers were on it.
So, he got, okay, I'll play on.
So, he fired up, uh,
no, the accordion is blog post.
He fired up Windows
and a virtual machine.
But the problem was this guy
was actually a pen tester
and he had just got a particularly
nasty things to fly out.
So, what were they doing here?
So, he led them one of the
files,
we set up the VM
and then he saved these
particularly as a viruses
in a folder called
bank passwords
and he then says,
oh, you know,
they were going on
but how terrible is
computing affected
on this and this and this.
So, please let us deal with this.
Oh, okay, right.
Yes, yes.
And we'll control your computer
and don't worry,
you don't need to any,
you go away
and he saved on the desktop
as, you know,
bank passwords or something like that.
Some of them very, very,
he says he watched the screen
move about for the
cursor move very while
and then next thing he saw was,
how to remote window,
pop up and then
a right click on this
full-dult bank passwords
copy and paste.
You're just really wishing
there was a
and this is what happened next.
But obviously that was
with the video ended.
Rename the exes.docs.
Oh, no, that would have been
a good day.
This is,
this is such really
that happens,
but
it's because
my ass always
in my normal pop up.
It's kind of a good time.
Rename the
the scan me like that,
will try to in the first
but once he's done,
there's not getting the
scan was getting
standing, but
then the phone people up.
I mean,
I mean, the one day
where, yeah, he starts singing on the
phone.
I remember,
when you can hear them
mean some of the else up
in the background.
So I mean,
I mean, the one
they're actually where
they just
I hanged up and
I said, well,
I've got a phone
again and back and then I lay
all the same thing.
It's unfortunate too,
because behind,
you know, call my
de-sbooth being
already ever in
telephony,
I think I'm really high behind a wall
of anonymity.
It's hard to track them down sometimes.
Actually, one time,
one of it was the first time,
I basically, you know,
just had one of these things.
I've never had it before,
but he had my like,
I've done a
support hack
once.
I mean, that's really
like competing with help
to like pat, you know,
so I had this call
and that was like,
well,
what we're doing is legal
and sort of thing, you know,
and then this guy was like,
oh yeah, well,
do you know why I live,
so
the way you can hide
in the phone
is true.
That's what we do as well.
And I've noticed
that a lot of time,
those workers are very
reluctant about giving out
information.
They won't tell you anything
about where they are
who they're working for
and not.
Well,
they do this.
I
did that right from
thinking once or
and they were going to go
right from
from,
and coming from
80 Victoria Street,
London now.
I thought this will
take a dress
to begin with,
right?
Like, you know,
this whatever
I've looked at since
because I said,
I wouldn't do a speech
etcetera.
So,
apparently,
that's actually the
most of London
office.
I looked up and
you've really
came up with something,
so
seems that you're like a
London office
for most of that
or in that
road or whatever it is.
Well,
it's like telling
one of my customers
the other day,
he had a pop-up
come up
didn't call back
because I told him to reboot,
so
I guess it's a pop-up
on a webpage
rather than actual virus,
but
you know,
telling him
he had an infection
and to
call this number
for tech support
and I told him,
no.
Microsoft
will never call you
in or contact you
in any fashion
to help you with anything.
Yeah, that's true.
But people don't
realize that
so they fall for this camp.
That's very true
in the enterprise role as well.
When you may,
it's for Microsoft
ever help you with anything.
I don't.
Unless you have
one.
Well, I'm sorry,
I'd be
worried
that's what you're talking about.
Most of that
will anything
not really,
but
I don't really
know about some sort of
blood
can
yeah,
it was like
virus
kind of type
program
more fixing
computer programming
like
from that
surfed in the
university base.
So, no,
I think when you've got to
unless you end up
paying them
eventually for
more
support or whatever
or possibly.
Well, that's what I
told him. I said,
you know,
Microsoft is almost unique
among
software companies.
Most software companies
have a way
to contact them
and get some sort of tech
support. Whereas,
you know,
Microsoft, if you wanted
to get them to give you tech
support,
there's nobody
you can contact
unless you have a
support contract.
Yeah,
let's let's be honest,
Microsoft are pretty
unique in
that they can actually
sell you a
defective product
and then
charge you
for a
temporary way of
supposedly fixing it.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm pretty sure
that if it was
anything else,
you know, whatever it was,
if you could
sold a product
that was defective,
you could take it back
and say,
look, I either want
to replace
with or want money back.
Can you do that,
Microsoft Windows?
But the people kind of
know, people sort of know
that
Windows doesn't really
work that well
because of
I mean, if you look at
mobile phones
because it's like
ever, you know, like
and it's like
iPhone and Android
are the anybody
actually wants Windows
phone
and it's mostly
Europe people
actually have Windows
phone but
when people get a choice,
that's the other
point.
Where it's cut
suckers is probably
very common
for this podcast,
but okay,
we can work again
when we get people
having a
choice
in the mainstream,
people don't need
enough
to show us the mobile world.
Well, to be fair,
let's look at what it's
due. I mean, if they were,
you know, purely based
on, you know,
what they're offering.
I mean, Microsoft
can obviously,
you know, because
the Xbox proves that.
I mean,
that obviously
they've made a decent
gaming system.
Okay, going head to head
with Sony.
But, you know,
they have got a decent
gaming system.
Now, that to me shows
that Microsoft,
when they have to
can produce something,
okay, their phones
are not up to scratch.
I've never used
our windows phone.
I don't think I'd want to.
But at the same time,
it would be interesting.
It was a more level
playing field
like, you know,
they've got on the consoles.
You can bet.
I don't,
if there was no disadvantage.
In other words,
if you could phone up
some like likes of
one of the local
call centers here,
and they had likes of,
for example,
they had instructions for
Ubuntu,
their instructions for market,
the instructions for windows,
and there was no disadvantage.
No thing like so.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not dealing with you
because you run this.
If there was none of that,
and people had a genuine choice,
I don't think anybody
would willingly choose Windows.
I mean,
you know, I mean,
one thing that makes me think is
it's almost like,
you know,
they've bullied their way into the
desktop PC and the laptops and that.
And they're staying there,
you know,
and they've basically made
legislation and they've
got contracts
so that they're installed
never in machine.
But I wonder how different
windows would actually be
desktop when
if they were forced to compete
like they do with a console.
So I mean,
they've obviously done well
because,
you know, I mean,
it's no coincidence
the Xbox
has actually done quite well.
I mean, it must be
a fairly decent system.
Well, when you talk about there,
you talk about their other
products.
And the last few days,
I've been seeing
at least on Hulu ads
for this
Microsoft Band,
which looks like a
cross between a
fitness bracelet
with a few,
a very few
smartphone
or smartwatch style functions.
And I look at that and I say,
even if this wasn't
with from Microsoft,
I don't know who wants to buy it.
I'm sure there's some
fan out there who will buy
every single Microsoft product.
There is.
I mean, I wouldn't say nobody
wants their stuff
because
at my school,
of course, I'm dealing with kids
like age 12 to,
you know, 15.
The device they all
want is a Surface Pro.
Like they all want to
service tablet.
So I mean,
the marketing that
Microsoft is putting out
there's working.
I see a lot of
colleges too.
The young professionals,
they all want the Surface Pro right now.
I want to say that actually
quite an exclusive thing
to across the pond
because in Britain,
nobody wants a Surface.
I mean, we were given a
bunch of services to try out
and the kids refused to
even try them out.
They would go in them for free.
No, no, no.
We're not interested.
So I'm actually wanting
have they been
focusing exclusive
in North America
in their advertising campaign?
Yeah.
So this is about two points now that.
So if Surface Pro
you mentioned,
well,
have it,
I mean, we just came up
earlier with
police free times wing,
but I bought the
Remix
OS tablet and the Remix
OS Mini
thing that you've been here,
TV and so on.
It runs a customised
Android
and
Starlight 4,
free form of Google employees
and it's called Desktop Like
and you can put your keyboard
and mouse in
where you see
the device.
That's my amazing
app on the phone.
Anyway,
but do you
tablet itself?
Yes.
It looks like a Microsoft
Surface Pro.
It's like a Chinese
copy.
The Apple will look like that.
The operating system is obviously
different
because I'm like I just said.
Um,
but um,
I think everything
that we get
point
there because, um,
yeah, the UK
known
once
Surface Pro is
is
well, it's not really known
as such.
People don't
don't need people to know
about as beautiful
in my past and schools
and so on.
And
yeah, I like
I like I like I like
I haven't
more like that.
So that's very
important.
I've seen you beta.
Well,
yeah, well,
there's
to be that much better
but yeah,
it's very
bad for that.
For the UK.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Actually, oddly enough,
we were actually given
I'm talking as a teacher.
We were given
Surface Pro
to try out
and most of us rejected
them and the big reason
we rejected them was
because
the windows
are tiling me.
Yeah,
but yeah,
the problems
windows are
the details and so on.
But saying all that, um,
windows 10 is
having
8 and 8.
More than that.
Well,
it's never actually had
windows on it.
Oh, no, sorry.
This computer.
I'm saying that's new computer.
My last computer didn't have windows on either.
But I'm talking purely
on the tablet that we were given.
It was windows 8, I think
or windows 8.
I don't care, actually,
but I tried it to be fair.
It was actually nice
on the metro interface,
but see as soon as
you actually loaded up
an application,
that application
motorless was designed for a mouse.
And it was not designed for touch.
I struggled to get any of the menus open.
Even when I keep it closing
the application,
I struggled to get it closed
because you'd have
that tiny idea of the screen
which was designated to
close,
maximize, minimize.
So of course,
click there was
basically potl enough.
Now, so I mean,
although the metro interface was
quite nice,
the applications
it was running were still designed
for that mouse.
Well,
although I don't know,
I mean,
these have windows,
I've seen, I think,
much more like a sort of tablet.
It's like,
windows 8 for tablet.
I think they dropped that
since because
people were confused
between the two versions anyway,
like the normal windows
were desktop and then
tablet,
which might be
well, the surface protein,
but actually.
Yeah, just so curiosity,
we've been talking about
the various things.
The sanity here
got
Tizenful.
Which one?
Tizen.
How was that?
No.
See it again.
I've never heard of that.
What's this spelling?
Oh, T, I, Z,
or Z over there.
E, N.
You haven't had a level
where that's Dm.
That's basically
Samsung's
plague,
thing of a grand
and
well,
you say that
Samsung's
not only kind of
there,
but it was an open-source
project.
A prop-source project
in tell,
where I show on the main
interview,
contribution started.
But, you know,
I've kind of been interested,
but the thing is,
the review safe
heard online
have been actually very good
for the Tizenful.
I just haven't actually
been able to get in my hands
on one.
Although it's,
it is next to my hit list,
I'd like to say a Tizenful.
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, well,
I was a bit like that
with Firefox,
so I wanted
one of the five thoughts
phone for years,
right?
I don't want to talk
to my final name.
I don't want to talk to my final name.
I don't want to talk to my final name.
I don't want to talk to my final name.
I don't want to talk to my final name.
But yeah, it was like,
I can't mean by it here,
because it was wherever
you have to go for miles
and buy and get it.
And I think Tizen
is the same game for the same kind of thing,
because I've had
a little,
a little trying out
and saying,
just,
I don't know,
the market there.
But people do only like,
five thought
was a little bit of a game
tied to the world,
but now,
saying that,
five thoughts there,
says,
it's everywhere,
it's at it.
It's not going to
be on phones
as a normal,
as I've given up.
I think it will carry on
two ladies from Panasonic
and they're just about,
but that's it.
Really,
five thought,
say that was actually,
because it's actually quite nice
for what it is.
A five-boxer was a nice design to it,
but it doesn't get the basics right.
I mean, the biggest problem,
I've got two five-boxer
phones here.
Oh,
one low end,
one medium end.
I've got the ZTE open,
which was a first five-box phone
you could buy in the UK.
I've also got the Geeks phone revolution,
which was,
at the time,
it was kind of higher
and now it's very much
mid to low end,
but the biggest problem with them,
both is,
it's not actually usability.
They're both quite usable,
but both of them,
it's the battery.
I mean, they just,
with Firefox OS,
they just couldn't even last a day.
I mean, they were lasting six hours maximum
and that was with no phone calls.
The odd thing about Firefox OS was
you could be on it all day
and it lasted the bad lasts.
You could not be on it
or they could be stand by all day
and the bad lasts.
It's in a real problem of battery life.
It's had a lot of features missing,
but it should promise in the early days.
But now, of course,
Mozilla have said
they're moving away from phones
and going towards internet up to,
that's a big,
so basically that's Firefox OS
dumped as a phone away.
Well, yeah,
so I haven't actually made calls
like Firefox,
so I could tell one is
Amazon quite cheap.
I'm actually making calls on little text yet,
but for, like,
looking around the app to kind of the interface
and so on,
yeah, it does seem very nice.
That's a battery life.
I mean, I haven't used it for
calling text like this.
I've had that phone on a lot
and then, more otherwise,
it seems to work quite nicely with the battery.
That's all there is to be something different
because even with having it on standby
with the revolution or the ZTE,
it would not last more than a six hours.
It just went to what you did
from fully charged to having no text,
no phone calls, no anything.
It would just go day and day.
Yeah, it sounds a bit like the year after year,
first of that in the B2E.4.5 event event
because a bunch of dimensions
when you were in there,
but let's say a lot smaller enough
to really mention that here,
so anyway,
but when I hit that phone,
I remember always having to plug it in a lot.
The B2E.5,
or the phone,
and that was really,
my phone really does have a bad battery.
I remember seeing real intolerance
with people saying the same thing,
it was a lot more too late.
And that kind of battery was okay.
But right, you don't really want a phone
that you need to actually give the charger a lot
because that kind of defeats the point.
Well, you can't understand having a charge once a day.
I mean, that's how I kind of give
the smartphone it wants every day,
but once every six hours,
oh, I am returned.
Yeah, hello.
Hey, welcome back.
Happy to be here.
It's not quite yet here.
What time yet?
9.14.
No, 2.14 here,
so I passed it 2.25.
I take a year in the UK.
Oh, yes.
I'll look at probably a case off from my accent.
You have an accent?
Really?
Well, we have been listening to Gordon all afternoon.
Look, that's not even a real accent.
That's a Southern Scotland accent.
That's just a central belt accent, you know.
I don't even consider that Scottish.
To say that to him, I really wind him up.
So, which part of the Scotland are you from?
I'm from the island of Lewis,
in the north-west, there to Herberti.
You, by chance, know any Gallic?
A little bit, but I'm not fluent.
I wasn't.
Although I'm from here,
I wasn't brought up by people from here,
so my Gallic is a little...
Hello, Cameron Hasev.
Sorry to say that again, I was coughing at that time.
Hello, Cameron Hasev.
Hamigumar Tapalaij.
Cameron Hauhane.
Aha.
Hamigumar Tapalaij.
The adult who in you?
I reckon this is the first new year's show with Gallic on it.
And you slumed answered me, by the way.
I'm sorry?
I'm saying you still haven't answered me, by the way.
I'm deeply offended by that.
We've kind of come to my limit there.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Well, I'll give you one more word of Gallic,
and I'm enjoying our wee Ishkebeer.
Do you know what Ishkebeer means?
Ishkebeer is what they call whiskey,
and literally translated it's the water of life.
So, if you're in Scotland and you get offered Ishkebeer,
it's whiskey.
It could also be...
Whiskey could also be referred to as Chivik,
which means wee one.
And what they refer to there is most scostling whiskey.
So, you read that out for that beer or a wee one, a wee drum.
You know, so, a Chivik means...
Basically, it means a wee drum.
So, it'd be something like, say, add some whiskey to the tea.
It'd be cool, and Ishkebeer owns a tea.
Something like that.
Ishkebeer owns a tea.
I'd never heard anyone actually say that.
I would probably more likely have heard people say,
Ishkebeer, Augustinthey, Augustkovpanthey.
So, you know, a whiskey and a cup of tea.
Not many people Scotland would put whiskey in there.
More likely put whiskey in a coffee.
And I don't know the word for coffee, so.
Coffee, that's it.
Ha!
Here you go.
So, you could maybe say something like...
Coffee, August, Ishkebeer.
So, just kind of curiosity at some point in the future.
Could I pick your brains a little more?
Yes, no bother.
Do you listen to my show at all?
Uh, what's your show?
Tuxjam.
Oh, I will add it to my playlist, for sure.
I was going to say, at the end of every Tuxjam,
I always talk about how to contact me,
so you can contact me through that.
Those videos media.
Hey, just a curiosity.
I say, nobody else here.
Is anybody else here?
A YouTuber, do you produce a YouTube?
Yes, I do.
Right, flicking tell me how the heck you do it,
because I have tried the last few months,
just putting the podcast on YouTube.
It never ever uploads.
It just, it, well, apparently it uploads,
but processing goes to 95% then fails,
and I've just given up,
because each time I've always got this leaking,
coffee right note is take down notice,
which I always dispute,
and always gets, well,
renewed in my favour,
because I use Jemento music,
but, um, do you know what's,
what's this?
No, it nonsense from 95% processing,
and then it fails.
Do you know what's triggering the coffee,
right?
Is this music or, oh, it's always music,
but I guess all of my tracks,
or I use in the podcast actually,
come with music, they're all from Jemento.
So I always rebute them,
and I say, look,
this is what I got the music.
This is the,
this is the track.
It's the license reached under.
I can use this,
and really often it's,
well, I've tried upload three,
three shows,
and in three or three,
it's basically said,
you've got a coffee reclaim,
okay, it's been dropped.
So, yeah, I run to that same problem,
because I upload very obscure music,
a lot of things like,
old records that I find that are
to the look of insanity.
I live in that, you know,
you can't buy on any digital format now.
And I've found some simple things,
like you've seen the time,
stretch, toll, and audacity,
except for you.
You're obviously kind of missing
with the pitch and time of the audio,
but I've found that
or adding some epic granular or granular noise
to the audio bypasses of those filters.
Oh, interesting.
But I think it's,
it's not as easy with that simply to filter the problem,
it's,
it uploads a hundred percent.
That's no problem.
But then it saves me processing.
I'm processing goes from one,
two, three, four, five percent.
Up over 95 percent, then just stops.
So basically, after three months in a row,
and I've just kind of given up
on a YouTube, I'm basically
sticking my two fingers up to it.
I mean, it goes on to SoundCloud, no bother.
It goes on to Vimeo, no bother.
Ah, yeah, actually,
plug the show.
If you're on Vimeo, type in Tuck's channel,
T-U-X-G-I-A-M, you'll find it.
But it's,
the problem is, it just doesn't seem to.
It's almost like it's
no interested in YouTube.
I contacted YouTube to see,
this is a problem.
They ignored it. Oh, good, fine.
Well, Kevin, you were asked
earlier about our libations.
I've moved on from Beard to
drinking single malt,
single malt,
Aberlore from a
good new Linux voice coffee cup.
The Aberlore coffee cup.
Sorry, carry on.
Now, I'm drinking out of a good new Linux voice coffee cup,
which came, I ordered,
came in the mail today.
It's got RMS on the back of it.
I got to see the FSF this past August.
Please tell us all about it.
Oh, it kind of felt like going to the White House.
I was in Boston and just,
I was like, you know, I'll look up,
he was like, you know,
I've seen the address of the FSF a million times.
It's in the header for every piece of
GPL license software I've ever looked at.
So I just pulled up a piece of code
and there was the address and dropped that into Google Maps
and it turned out it was a block away.
So I wandered over and rang the doorbell
and I was like, hey, I'm a member of the FSF
and they're like, come on up.
And so I went up and they gave me a little tour
and showed me around.
RMS wasn't in, so I didn't get to meet him.
But he's got a pretty cool office.
They've got stuff to canoes all over the place.
I have a shoe in the RMS.
And talked for him briefly
because I went to one of his speeches
and I talked for him at the end.
Well, I haven't been in quite such august company
but I did get to meet
Mad Dog at Ohio Lennox Fest
and talked to him for a while.
So that was pretty cool.
Mad Dog is a cool dude.
We'll see about the guy who actually
the guy who started the EVRFM.
Where did we go?
Well, I'm looking at the EVRFM.
I've heard of it, of course.
I have to sign up for that sometime.
Yes.
When you see the EVRFM for years
because that's quite popular
do you actually.
But that's the commut proprietary music.
But you could stream it.
You stream different stations
because everyone knows music like that.
But then because of many issues
where it was they made a stream
to come YouTube,
which was annoying
and then you could only
play so much
and then it would
wouldn't let you play more.
We had to reload or to get around
and all the slinest.
So it's still been used there.
But then, really,
I recently it's all just
going to Spotify.
So I thought, you know,
I don't really use Spotify at all really.
So I thought,
well, I can just
when I actually start listening
to get the commutory music in the poply.
So I've got the last
Libra family.
Yeah.
I've been
making a stream
music.
I'm not like that.
But it's family.
It's family.
Except it's
also it's kind of coming
with it now,
which is why
it's listening to me.
Well, I mean,
every time I've tried out
Jim Mendo,
it seems to be,
you know,
way over towards
more metal than I like.
So how is the
usual stream on Libra FM?
First of all,
I heard that it's my
sound, actually,
it's K-Wish,
beautiful thing,
it's time to make them.
And yeah,
it's a little
messel on
Demento
and the
Libra FM,
but there's other stuff as well.
Well, I used to
I used Jim Mendo on
out kind of fairly
weekly basis.
And well,
no, this one's daily basis.
The thing is it's,
I wouldn't say it's that much metal.
I mean, there's obviously,
there's a lot of different style.
I mean,
you can actually choose, you know,
can a country,
full,
whatever. I mean,
you don't actually have to choose
the metal style.
It has a wide range of stuff on it.
Yeah, it's been a while
since I've
poked, poked around
in creative commons,
music. So it's probably time
I do it again.
I really enjoyed Nerdcore,
but most of that stuff
is actually proprietary.
Really?
Well, I don't know
what type of musical
this you like,
but you are
a Final CC
It's been a while since I've tried
listening to it.
Well, CC Jam is one of the podcasts.
I kind of started,
but it was not meant to be
my podcast as such
because I just wanted to be anybody
that found any creative commons
music to submit stuff to.
Basically like an HPR before
CC music.
And I'm trying to
go through that,
but I mean, that that actually,
I've released the last kind of
you shows, but
it's something that basically
if you find CC music,
you like it,
just give a very
big yarn too.
And then,
ah,
you get a mainsail here,
CC Jam.
Maybe I should do one.
I don't know if it's
a really good thing to simply
want one.
It could be great, you know,
I mean,
purely because I haven't done one
a few weeks,
but well,
I've not had one a few weeks,
so of course that basically
CC Jam is nothing but
it just seems to be
I've had family
around and I've had
visitors around.
So, you know,
you can't actually just say
to your family, right?
Sorry, I'll see you later.
I've got recorded
a video, by the way.
It's CC Jam still getting
showed because I look,
you know,
being able to look for
a lot of advantages
but is it still going?
Is that
actually going to be the
point?
The last one was about
three weeks ago.
So that's the reason I'm saying this.
I would love it to be like
not even like HPR in the
daily sense.
I'd love it to be weekly,
but at the same time,
I don't want to be doing
everyone myself.
Yes,
CC Jam,
do I just record something
and then
let you know basically?
Well, essentially,
if anybody wants to listen to this,
I do actually have a blog with them,
but all you need to do
is if you've got
a band you like,
then all you need to do is
record yourself
giving a brief waffle.
Now, somebody even did this on a phone.
You don't actually need
to have any facial recording setup.
So,
record whatever you want.
I mean, it's just
listen, this isn't the band I like,
you know, they're from here.
Yeah, you don't have to have that.
That's just the case of this is the band.
This is a track.
I like them because they're good,
you know, at worst,
that's the best you can do.
But yeah,
I mean, if you can do better,
that's fine.
And then say,
all right, okay,
and we're going to leave you with this track.
So basically,
you've got two tracks.
Want to start the show?
Want to end the show?
Yeah, let all you need to do is
record the middle bit.
Send me the links to the two tracks
or the two tracks themselves.
I'll put them together.
I'll release them as a CC Jam show.
Is this something you're already releasing?
Yeah, I think we're on episode of A35.
Oh, wow.
Wasn't aware of it.
Uh, give me a second.
I'll pop the CC Jam
my blog post link into the chat room.
I think you're all new on that,
actually, because I've been missing something
on the web fan market.
I actually guess I'll demand it, really,
but they won't need on that.
But it was actually two tracks
I would type a button and say something.
So I think I might just do a CC Jam yet.
Um, I'll not go ahead and put the link
in the video blog and the show notes.
Also, would you be interested in say a quick show on
all American old-time music?
Sorry, you talking to me?
Yes, indeed.
Oh, of course.
I'm always interested in doing any shows at all.
I love podcasting.
I really do.
It's a genuine lover.
So what is it?
Ubuntu UK that always use the like 1920s track
for their intro music?
That does so.
Yeah, Ubuntu UK's got very old track.
Yeah, yeah.
Probably it's nitrate.
I'm talking about even older than that,
you know, going back to pretty much ending in the 19 teens
and, you know, music of the American southeast.
So is this something that there's actual recordings of
or are we going to be singing Camp Town races here?
Well, I mean, recordings of, you know,
people playing it now, but old songs.
Old Camp Town races.
Although there are recordings of old recordings as well,
that exist.
And by the way, Kevvie, I always have, you know,
loved your music selections on your shows,
like Tux Jam and Krivenson, etc.
Thank you, by the way.
Well, yeah, same thing as a practice as well.
Well, I think it makes a difference purely when
you listen, I mean, to be honest, I make a point these days.
Since I actually moved over to Linux,
I make a point, listen to CC music first
and whatever music second.
So I think maybe one of the things that I would actually
would say is it's not like I pick them out of a heart.
I do actually listen to these things.
I think, oh, that's good.
Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's just, you know,
CC music, but I'm using these believe I've found more than anywhere.
So that's just out of that, really.
And if I always think you're a podcast again,
I'm Krivenson as well, but well,
I don't have to remember, um, CC music anyway.
See, I rarely, you know, just sit down and,
I need to get back in, sit down, listen to music at all,
anymore. I think in the 90s, uh, talk radio sort of
replaced music for me and then got on the internet
and early Scott Broadband and got, uh,
uh, got in the, got into Linux, of course, podcast,
docky talk, occupy most of my listening time now.
Actually, to be honest, I'll probably agree with you there.
I do tend to listen to more podcasts and do anything else,
purely because one thing I find about radio,
I don't know what's like in the States,
but over here, I mean, you might hear, you know,
they might have like, I don't know, 50 good songs.
Oh, sorry, 50 songs and you might think,
oh, there's 10 and you, and you think that's okay.
And they'll play the same 50 songs all day.
And then you go the next day and at least same 50 songs all day
in a different order.
Then you go the next day and it's the same again,
same again, same again, same again.
That's the one thing that drove me away from commercial radio.
So, uh, no, I must admit, I do tend to listen to
commas music whenever I can, whether it's through, uh,
gemendo or what or the FMA.
But the other thing I've noticed is,
I don't know is it painting on my part,
but if somebody, if I'm swithering of a band camp album,
if I'm really swithering, I'm going,
will I or won't I buy it?
I'll look at the license.
If it's, call me right, I'll say no, I'll buy it.
If it's, if call me and so I'll go,
yeah, okay, I'll get the money.
Oh boy, bro.
Hey guys.
Hello.
Hello, I'm happy new year.
Happy new year or well, in a couple hours for me.
I think this is the year I dropped off the face of the earth
in terms of HPR and the hacker community.
Yeah, I'm seeing you around much.
Well, that's kind of why we do this show.
There's, there's people, you know, they're, uh,
and why, uh, I think I can speak for Hunky, uh,
we really wanted to do the show this year,
because there are people that this is the only time we get to talk to you,
face to face isn't right, but voice to voice or whatever,
you know, all, all year long.
And I don't mean just you, bro.
But I mean, there's a lot, there's a lot of people.
This is the, this is the only time we actually directly interact.
Yes, I know that right.
We'll send them to this.
Yeah, voice been lurking.
Um, in fact, I remember back on the binary
reparado, uh, let's say a digital dog pound show.
That was his thing.
It's funny, uh, Broman, I've actually hung out IRL more
than we've talked, talked to each other this year.
Yeah, that's where I've been mostly is working on the house.
I mean, it was a house.
It was a flip, you know, but we've been spending a lot of time
customizing it and that sort of thing.
And I mean, I did get to go to self this year.
But what have I missed just in general?
Oh, we were talking about creative commons music.
Lots of Star Wars, yeah, I missed the Star Wars talk.
Now, I have not seen it yet.
Is it worth my time and money or should I just skip it?
Um, yeah, I've seen it.
So I've never done Star Wars really.
So I'm seeing these first six, three years, but I'm
having a new one.
And, um, well, yeah, that's just very similar to the other ones.
But there also are differences.
So I would say it's definitely worth what's actually really
pressure coat.
Not only women, probably a little bit hyped,
but not just that.
They're actually getting me quite a good film.
Yeah, I think I'm going to go see it if, if this weekend,
if nothing else, uh, there's no way I continue,
can continue listing the podcasts without it being
spoilered for me after this next week.
I'm just certain of that.
So I might as well go see it.
I will go see it when it's up in the local cinema.
Unfortunately, that's no guarantees going to be in the near future.
Can you say that again?
I was saying I will go and see it when it's up in the cinema,
local cinema here.
Unfortunately, that's no guarantee.
It's going to be each other.
Oh, so you're just small islands, don't you mean?
Yeah, we tend to get films a few months after their release.
That's one thing I said no.
Now, I assume it's over there, just like it is here,
that a bunch of the little mom and pop theaters
closed when everything's switched they had to go to digital.
Not quite.
Everything had died off when the economy went out
in 2008, including the driving theater here.
That actually went out business after 50 some years.
But in the UK, I mean, there are some small less
in the market will show some unknown film,
particularly known in maybe occasional film.
But yeah, there's been the big company
you two have taken over.
The cinema's ready.
Yeah, to be honest, they offered a better experience
in the theater.
You had bigger, more comfortable speeds
and they would keep it clean.
Well, I'm just actually looking at the local cinema here.
According to the Roomba website,
it's going to show Star Wars 4-Shaw Weekends
on the 29th and 30th of January.
So it is coming relatively better than them
after everybody else.
Well, our local theater here
been subsidized by pretty much by one
the doctors for the last 25 years.
You know, it hasn't made it,
it may be breaking even, but never made a profit.
But, you know, what killed is what killed
every other little theater is that distribution went
on the new movies went to digital exclusively
and they couldn't afford to switch over equipment
since they weren't making any money anyway.
The theater in Fayetteville, North Carolina
just barely managed to raise enough money
to do the switchover.
There's been also a research in theaters
that show 35 millimeter and 60 millimeter films now.
Tickets are a little more pricey, but...
Yeah, but you'd have to be in an area where, you know,
people would want to go to that sort of film
and see an older film in the theater.
I mean, small town America, you know,
no, they want the new movie with the explosions.
They don't care about that stuff.
Yeah, that's a four-hour drive for me,
but it is cool to see some of those older formats.
Well, at least most of y'all have theaters back home.
It was a pretty fair drive to get to a theater.
Well, that's like me now.
It's, you know, if I want to go to theater,
it's a minimum of an hour drive.
I mean, I'm 15 minutes too bad.
15 to 20 minutes, right?
10 minutes, maybe 15.
Yes, four.
Yeah, for man, there's been about 20 minutes
away in the car.
And then, if you case that, you'll sit to eat
and there's actually two days,
and then there's a little one a bit further away as well.
So, there's actually books and miles in this area,
basically.
That might mean some mountain-booking,
but there's a little small one as well,
but that's for not big movies, really.
And unfortunately, I think there's three this spring.
I'm going to have to go see,
rather than wait and form to hit Red Box,
Force Awakens,
Superman versus Batman,
just because people are going to be talking about it
the next day, too.
And I really, I've seen the trailers for Deadpool,
and that looks awesome.
Yeah, I mean, that is actually slightly annoying
with films, to be honest,
how certain films it's like.
Oh, you know, what do you call it?
You call it, call it,
call it goes to Superman,
Z-Bat, and I'm really quite soon when it's been on.
I mean, we've just had a new James Bond film as well,
which is obviously very popular in the UK,
and actually, that was the most popular film this year,
showing in the UK.
No film in Star Wars,
because that just came out.
And then, for I think it was the
Hunger Games, something like that.
Ockin J, part two.
They were, I mean, I'm not a specter
the other week, and
even though I'd be in there about three months,
or two months already,
I'd say on the front row,
that's how full it still was.
The game has been, and then,
I'm actually watching Bond,
who is not,
one,
because look,
it's quite global,
but
I think it's not as big as,
obviously, stables and things like that,
but it's kind of one of the things
that England's own is named for.
I think I actually remember the last time I've been to the theatre.
I haven't seen the new Star Wars,
when I wait till it comes out on DVD,
and spoilers be damned.
If you see a 3D film in the UK,
do you have to return the real 3D glasses they use,
or can you keep it?
That's a good question, actually.
So, in the past,
like, all the other year,
you could just basically walk out with them,
and you're supposed to return them,
but people walk out with them.
Nowadays, basically, you want you to pay a pound for them,
but you could just say,
I bought them a nine,
and then,
you know, I got them given them anyway,
but yeah, I'm trying to get some money off them now,
because otherwise, people just walk out with them.
Yeah, I caused a bit of commotion,
because I was walking out with them,
and I found out, you know,
I'd be charged again and again for that premium.
So, I only see the 2D films now.
I don't think it's worth the five bucks
or whatever they charge me.
I think we see the 3D assets anyway,
so, I guess I do hear them now,
but I never really notice it as such.
So, it's a bit of a race to money,
but on the other hand,
I guess it's kind of supposed to be bad,
so I would only give for the 3D show,
a month and 2D if there is one.
Yeah, I try to get new glasses,
and I've tried to see 3D movies a few times,
and I can only perceive it if my glass is off,
but by that time,
I can't even see the edges of things, so.
Yeah, there's more of the red glasses as well,
so I think it wouldn't really make any difference
if I had them on the wall underneath anyway,
so yeah.
That was my last experience of 3D.
Of course, that was 30 years ago
when they had the cardboard glasses,
but I tried to put them inside my glasses,
outside my glasses,
and you know, I couldn't focus either way,
and either I saw a blurry movie
or I didn't see it at all.
Yeah, and I also found that I got my dreams ever pretty bad.
And I called them the other day,
and they said, I said,
Will, you know,
will your 3D glasses fit over my lenses,
and they said,
Will, if you've got really big lenses,
which I do, not huge, ridiculous lenses,
but, you know, I always like to have as much glass
out there in front of me as possible,
so I'm not going to pay for a ticket online
and get up there and find out I can't see anything,
so I'll go buy and check their, you know,
make a buy of the theater when I'm in town
and say, Hey, can I try on your glasses?
But I'm not going to book a ticket
without knowing what the outcome's going to be.
I have three thin polycarbonates,
and I would say I have no problems.
I can see the 3D.
I can't remember what the film I last saw on 3D,
and it was like, it wasn't really a good film,
but you could definitely see some of the effects.
So I have no problems with it,
but yeah, if you've got Coke bottles 50,
you're probably going to have some trouble.
But that's an interesting idea,
like, saying you're going to try glasses on fast,
but you don't have any new styles,
you know, I think I'm really,
there is something free to use,
such from now on,
but I'll go check it,
but then my bag will start at the end,
and my color's on the use, like,
Oh, look, can you take glasses off?
You can see two styles there,
or you can see,
so the one down the credits,
something like that, so the bag,
because it's a bit annoying for you to say,
the same with high definition to you Lee.
I think it really makes a difference
between that and standing the definition
to such sort of a bit.
Yeah.
I'll argue that one, though.
There's a huge difference between HDTV
and regular standard TV.
I mean, even with just like,
if you watch some of the broadcasted channels,
and the ones that are broadcasted,
and HD versus regular TV,
the amount of clarity in the difference between
the two is very, very noticeable.
I mean, you notice them a lot,
especially in like live broadcasts of stuff,
like live broadcasts of our football games
and hockey games and stuff like that.
You can really notice the difference,
but there's a huge difference with that.
Now, I got a question for you.
Do you know,
does any of you,
or do any of you know anybody who actually bought
a 3D television,
or has a 3D television at home?
Yeah, my neighbor.
No, nothing.
Do they use it a lot?
I don't know.
I tend not to associate with people
who would buy such frivolous technology.
Well, to be fair,
I did actually buy it off the shelf.
He bought the second hand of Facebook.
And basically, he got a good actually deal,
because he got a 55 inch 3D TV
for a couple of hundred quids.
I can't believe it.
No, no, no, no, no.
The thing is, in the UK,
I think it will be a bit differential,
but in the UK,
there really is not really anything
coming any way,
so there's a little bit here in there.
Well, by the way, if you get a good deal
on a 50-inch television,
and you can't pass that up.
Yeah, exactly.
So I don't blame for it.
I mean,
we're the same.
We're not quite a 50-inch,
but we've got a case of somebody
from a white...
Well, I'm not on Facebook, actually.
What do you think of this?
And I'm going,
buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it, no.
That was within two minutes of it going up.
Ah, it was a 46-inch HD.
Yeah, that'll do me nicely.
When I was in Raleigh,
my roommates had a 52-inch TV
that had been left there
by a previous roommate when he left.
So basically, he got a free one.
Are TVs considered less expensive in America?
Well, really, there was some good Black Friday deals
I took advantage of,
but they were dumped...
There's hundreds of dollars' price difference
between smart TVs and dumb TVs.
And I didn't think the smart TVs
were such a great deal.
But I walked into Walmart and got a 50-inch
for, I think, $145.
A dumb TV, I think.
One of the things we do in America,
though, I've noticed is,
if you buy the TV at a brick-and-mortar store,
they're usually taking another television
in all its components
and upselling it on you.
So you end up with models
that are made for best by Walmart, etc.
Well, that's true.
I'm sure a lot of these cheap ones
are no better than what they absolutely
have to be to get out the door.
Yeah, every single deal you see
like that for Black Friday,
they're all just the upsells
of some previous model.
And to be honest,
my experience traveling overseas
that seems like TVs are
in cheaper in America.
But then again,
I've really only been in the cities.
So...
Anyway, guys.
Just know
if I've been one of my best.
Good night, boys.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Have a good night.
Thanks for stopping by.
It's been a little thanks for having me.
I'm just a guest.
Thank you.
Well, no more guests than any of the rest of us.
You know, we're all contributors
to the podcast.
So no reason to feel you're
anymore out of place
than anybody else here.
Well, thank you very much.
But anyway, I'm just sitting on the night.
Good night.
Now to, you know, the answer
the question about 3D.
I did notice all the ones
in the store seem to advertise 120
Hertz, which used to be, you know,
what was necessary for 3D.
But no mention of 3D at all
on anything I saw this year.
Is anybody else hearing fireworks?
Nope.
Nope.
Do gunshots count?
Yep.
Yes, we'll count gunshots.
Then yes.
Yeah, it's funny.
I left Fayetteville and the number of gunshots I heard
went down dramatically.
Was that what you said?
I did about makes them anymore.
And no comment.
He walked into that one.
No comments.
I did five minutes ago here, like,
you know, almost like a doorbell dang
from one of my electronic devices
that I don't think I've ever heard before.
And that always freaks me out being
a loan in the home.
And I hear an electronic noise
and I think nothing that I have makes that noise.
You sure just wasn't your neighbor
stopping by to watch movies?
No, he's out of town right now.
And I don't have a doorbell, so I don't.
It must have been the tablet,
but if so, it's a noise it's never made before.
Yeah, you ever have the game where
your the device goes off
and you have to figure out which one it is?
So anyone doing any year-end donations?
I donated a few bucks to the FSF,
but that's about it for me.
Most of my historical society memberships
and the like come to later in the year
about April and May.
I don't have the link.
I'll try to find out.
Used to be up on Linux Basics,
but probably be a nice gesture
to throw some bucks John Newsteaders
away first to support the server.
That's just before I made my donations this year.
And Jonathan Nado.
Always a good choice.
Accessual computing and his little project
to do the tutorials I gave to that open-foss training.
That would be it.
Yeah, I would try to drop enough money
to drop a tax bracket.
I don't know if I'm successful or I won't know for a little while.
Well, if you need to, you have two hours to donate.
Like I said, the FSF is looking for money.
The Norfolk Southern Historical Society is always looking
for some cash.
We're actually looking at restoring a caboose.
So that could use some donations.
I'll keep that in mind.
I did see that software from Conservancy
needed some cash.
So I obliged a bit.
I've given them some money and some time,
but I seem to be mostly giving people these days.
And I think Wikipedia and the Mozilla Foundation
are both asking for some money right now.
Yeah, Bert Yerke, he already paid some in.
We should acknowledge
Well, really, probably a good time to acknowledge
everybody who contributed John Newsteader,
of course, for providing the Mumble Server,
Kevin Wischer for providing the stream,
Taj, who's right here,
for providing the shared etherpad,
Bert Yerke for providing the funds
to cover the bandwidth on the Mumble Server.
And Dave Lee offered the use of the Bugcast server,
but it was decided that probably a lot of people
would get lost on the wrong server.
Josh Napp from an honesthost.com,
for, of course, for providing the HPR infrastructure
and honking the goo.
And this other dude, we don't need to mention
for organizing the event.
Now, I think we need to thank everybody for showing up.
I mean, we kind of slapped this thing together
at the last minute, almost seemed like.
And we were just kind of wondering
whether people were going to show up for it.
And I'm very proud that people did.
Yeah, I think it's been very successful.
We don't have as many crowded in the room
as we have before.
And I hope people aren't bouncing off
because I can increase the number of connections.
Would we see that if somebody tried to connect and couldn't?
Probably.
I might check server logs just to be safe,
but we are under in limit, so.
Okay, I didn't know what his default limit was.
I think it's 20 users, I don't know.
I think we maxed out on the stream.
I think I saw Kevin post the stream maxed out at 14 at one point.
Has gone up since I know he's listening.
Well, he posted, he just posted in the mumble chat
that it was default was 20 connections.
So we've been well under that all day long.
Far as I know, unless there was just a huge amount of people
drop in when I was AFK this afternoon.
No, there was a lot of good discussion
while you were gone this afternoon.
Todd has been in the room for a good portion of the day.
Have you been gone for only a little bit?
Haven't you touched?
I had to take off for a little bit to do dinner and stuff.
Yeah, I've been kind of around most of the day.
So yeah, it's been pretty lively.
There have been very few dead spots.
I was actually surprised.
And most of those dead spots were, you know,
at most, maybe 45 minutes long.
Let's just get stripped out and post anyway.
Right, it'll be completely transparent.
Strong Kate silence.
Not if you guys talk about it, geez.
You're ruining the magic.
We'll have to come up with some more magic.
Someone flip the switch.
Oh, no.
Oops, speaking of which,
I'm going to kill and save my recording right here
at the top of the hour and restart and only take a second.
Now I can breathe.
And it's time to say happy new year to Brazil, Argentina,
Buenos Aires, Santiago,
Asunquion and Paramaryville.
Thank you.
Did that very well?
I had some practice while you were gone this afternoon.
See, I would have managed to butcher even those names.
All right, back to the previous discussion.
Has anybody seen a 4K TV or even a 4K monitor?
Yes.
Yes.
I have not seen one in person.
No.
Oh, you're behind times.
It's all about 8K now.
640K being ought to be enough for anybody.
But what is the difference between, you know,
what is it, 1080i and then something like a 4K?
I mean, the HD, it seems to be pretty darn good,
but at least as good as my eye can see.
And then what is 4K?
And is anybody, is there anybody who broadcasts in 4K?
Is there any videos out in 4K?
Is there any DVDs out in 4K?
How can you get something to be able to test to see what that looks like?
Aren't there some 4K videos on YouTube?
There's actually quite a few on YouTube now.
They're shot in 4K?
Yep.
I could even tell the difference between 720 and 1080i.
I actually saw them on display in Tokyo,
like a demo and the source content looked pretty good.
To me, it looks good.
It looks better.
I mean, there's no doubt that it's better.
But I think the jump from standard definition to high definition
was much more impressive than the jump from HD to HD or whatever.
I mean, you can see the difference,
but to me, it's not worth upgrading.
Yeah, I mean, not anywhere near it.
Yeah, on a TV bigger than 30 inches,
I think I can tell the difference between 720p and 1080p,
but I really can't tell any astounding difference
when I rented a Blu-ray versus a DVD.
I might as well save the 50 cents.
Now, probably if I had two identical or similar TVs
and two Blu-ray players and I put in the DVD and one
and the Blu-ray and the other probably side by side,
I'd be able to tell some kind of difference,
but is it enough to mess with?
I don't think so.
You have to have this size to accommodate the resolution.
And I think I'll kind of agree with that argument right there.
I mean, I can, I have a bunch of,
sorry, I have a bunch of HD, I have just regular DVDs
and a bunch of Blu-rays as well.
And I think there probably is a difference,
but it's not a substantial difference.
I think one of the big things, like I said earlier,
is on live TV.
Like, I can, I'll be watching football.
And if I watch it in the standard definition,
it looks like blurry garbage compared to the HD channels,
are you getting, are you getting that too?
I'm just like cable or over the air.
Cable through Xfinity.
And I have air sometime, it's crazy good,
because it's not compressed.
I have noticed, you know, what they were saying,
you know, when we went to 1080p or whatever,
when they zoom in on celebrities, they look hideous now.
You can see all the pores on their faces.
And I would love to be able to do stuff over the air,
but I'm at a spot where I get like next to nothing over the air.
I mean, I want to, I want to, at some point,
get a halfway decent antenna and give it a shot,
like a real shot, but I'm kind of at like a weird,
next point where most of us being broadcasted
from another Rhode Island or Boston,
and I'd have to find a way to catch and just write
and get a pole tall enough to be able to make it pass
the trees and stuff.
And I think I can do it,
but I think I might be able to get something,
but I'm, I think I'm at a bad spot
for catching stuff over the air.
I tried with just like,
I got a quick little homemade one,
and I got like five channels,
but they're like crappy channels.
So that's not even worth it.
Yeah, I have the same problem.
I live in a valley.
So the only channel I get is some home advertising channel,
that's it.
Yeah, I live in the local news.
Yeah, I had to live that life for gosh a long time.
We, we up until probably
six, seven years ago, there was no cable
TV anywhere near here.
And satellite just was not a doable thing
because we live in this big valley, basically.
So you couldn't really get a clear shot
at the sky to use satellite.
So everybody had these,
I mean, we all had these still,
most of us have them in the backyard,
these giant antenna towers
that where we got our analog TV from.
Needless to say, we didn't watch much TV.
Yeah, what is it about the home buyer channels
that seem to be able to come over,
you know, freaking anything?
If I got just a wire sticking in the back of it,
I can get it like a QVC.
Hi, at least around here,
it seems like the towers
they use for this home channels
are not in premium locations.
So they seem to be out,
you know, way outside the city,
should where I live.
Well, it's, they make sure that they come through
so you can buy things.
To be honest though, with the internet now,
it's, I don't see a need
to really pull channels over the hair
or get cable TV.
Yeah, I'm working my way towards the cord cutting.
I can't, I can't pull the cord.
Well, I struggled because I fought so much
with Xfinity when it comes to billing.
I've noticed, I've noticed after a while
that, that Comcast or Xfinity
or whatever has kind of a fuzzy math
when it comes to their billing.
There's no, there's no setting there
at all that's all kind of,
hey, we have this promotion
so we can kind of charge you this.
And then we have this other promotion
where you can charge you that.
And then you take this off
and that kind of changes things.
And it's a weird, fuzzy math
and then we'll charge you this
if you didn't, if you take this off.
And anyways, I needless to say,
I spend a good amount of time arguing
on over the phone with, with billing of Comcast.
And every time I did,
they'd say, okay, we have that fixed
and a week later, they didn't fix anything.
And then they go, all right,
we'll get that fixed again.
And so I wanted to get rid of them completely.
But I couldn't get rid of them completely
because they're about the only place
and where I live that I can get
broadband internet or basically any internet
besides possibly dial up.
So no matter what, I'd have to keep
Xfinity, I mean, a Comcast,
but I wanted to cut the cord from just the television.
But there's always something like
one or two little things that seem to be holding me back.
And I mean, I do the Hulu,
I do Netflix.
I've even gone with the Amazon Prime,
which isn't necessarily that great.
It's got a bunch of cool little stuff here and there.
And then like some stuff will show up on it later on.
Like some shows will show up on it later on
that aren't available on other things.
But I haven't been able to just make,
there's that one last line
that I just can't reach it to cut the cord completely.
And one of the big things is actually sports and stuff.
That's like, I mean, I know there's ways
to get around that kind of,
but I'm right there at that edge
of just being able to cut the cord.
I didn't, well, I had the chance.
I didn't take the time, put up a
over there antenna before I moved in.
But I don't watch much sports,
but as far as episodic TV goes,
I keep, you know, between Hulu
and, you know, various other legal means.
There really isn't as much that I can't get
that's broadcast over the air.
I don't watch TV.
In 50, you're missing out with the Daredevil
and Jessica Jones on Netflix.
Well, I agree with you there,
but as I said, broadcast, you know,
stuff that I'd have to pay a subscription.
Well, I guess I am paying for show time
along with my Hulu subscription.
In fact, I finally threw in the other
couple bucks a month for no commercials.
Not so much, I wasn't seeing the commercials,
but they just, you know, for a one minute.
For some reason, the show would play,
but a one minute commercial would buffer for five minutes.
So I just, I got tired of sitting through that.
Yeah, I had the same problem because I would,
I was using Hulu on my phone.
And there would be points
where I'd have like connection issues.
And I would have to, you know,
shut it shut Hulu down and then restart it back up again.
And when it restarted back up again,
it automatically has to go into a commercial.
So it's sit there, go through a commercial,
go through about two minutes of the show.
It would then go to where it was originally
supposed to have its commercial.
And then it have, I'd go through,
watch about five minutes of the show,
have buffering problems, shut it down
and then have to start the whole process over again.
So it's like watching commercial TV.
Exactly.
Yeah, I don't use Hulu much,
but when I did, I just turned on the ad blocker.
And I would just sit there on a blank screen
because I can't stand ads.
You know TV exists solely to deliver advertisements to you, don't you?
Ah, true, true.
Oh, I thought they had that worked out.
So if you blocked the ads,
they wouldn't let you see the show either.
I'm thinking like two or three years ago,
I don't even use Hulu anymore.
But when I did, it would just sit at like a black screen
and say, you know, we can't display these ads right now.
And I'll leave about 90 seconds.
Oh, okay.
I remember that.
Yeah.
Even Lord D has a going.
Hello, sir.
I don't know how it's got a couple of day.
I have chemo, cats, they found a possible blood clotter.
Today, I had to go back to have other cats
to try to confirm it.
Oh, that's not fun.
Is that something they would have to operate on
or would they give you blood centers to take care of that?
I'm assuming medication because they said
that I wasn't showing any side effects.
So it would probably just...
Well, I hope it's not one of those things
that could get up and move around.
Surely they wouldn't let you have the hospital if it could.
Well, people, I'm going to have to jump off
and do the family festivities.
So I'll probably try to hop back on here
after midnight, but I'm going to be gone for a little bit.
Rock and do.
Yeah, thanks for joining us all day long, Toshers.
But there would have been...
Without you, there would have been
long periods of silence, I think.
That might have been preferable.
You know, whatever.
I'll catch you guys later.
All right, have a good evening, sir.
Happy new year.
Yeah, I think I might have to drop off, too.
Well, I'm looking at...
We'll probably be firing off some artillery around midnight.
So I might see if I can capture some of that on here
if y'all don't object.
You're going to record yourself firing our artillery cannon.
That's the plan.
Fireworks, rifle, cannon.
Yeah, go ahead and blow shut up.
We can celebrate by 2016 by blowing up a smump.
Yay.
Well, I am in the mountains of North Carolina at the moment, so...
Yeah, we don't need them.
Blow it up.
I mean, it is part of the local culture
to blow things up.
At some point, I need to go warm up last night's chicken masala
before the Scotch catches up with me on an empty stomach.
You know what happens when 50 gets drunk?
You better do this 50.
Falls asleep on the stairs,
although I do not have photographic evidence for this,
so it didn't happen.
Never going to let me live that one down, are you?
Not until you find something else to do the next OCP Live.
Speaking of, what is that?
We're going to do one for 2016.
Uh, it could be in the cards.
I don't know.
I think, um...
What was the last known god was the one that planned the last one
and couldn't actually make it.
So maybe we should let him do it again.
Yeah, he got messed over by his bosses at the last minute.
That was...
That was really not cool.
Fantastic says we should have it in Canada.
Vancouver's a nice town.
She doesn't have her passport.
I don't know what she's thinking.
Hi, if it happens in May or just so,
that's enough time to get a passport, I think.
Uh, now she's going on about T1.
I'm catching a donkey shell.
Oh, I've been to Canada,
but I haven't been to Mexico, so who knows.
Either way, I think our currency is stronger right now,
so probably once we got there,
spending money and go further.
That's true, but, you know, we might...
We might have to have one of those agreements
where we just don't talk about certain things that happen.
At any rate of time.
Of course, you know, I'm going to be...
Go ahead, I was going to say I'm going to drop off,
but that's because I have something I need to tend to.
I was going to say you know if I go to Tijuana,
who's going to get arrested.
Look, if anyone's getting arrested,
we all know it's pirate, okay?
Hey, now, that only happened once.
Well, that's just because of the eye patch.
No, that's how he gets the eye patch in Tijuana.
And we'd like to wish you a happy new year before I go,
and we wish you lots of fire ants in the future, pirate.
I'm not sure why.
I mean, told did say this,
but there's a sharp object over my head.
Wait, wait, took Britastic saying,
there's lots of fire ants in my future?
I guess so, yes.
She's been getting weird fortune cookies lately.
She got one was like, the greatest thing about the number of standards
is there's so many to choose from.
I don't know, there's a fortune cookie about fire ants.
I don't know, I have to go.
This is sharp.
Have a good evening, sir.
And then there were five.
Well, 50, I've got, I've got one in routers
from Saint-May Hopper.
Which one is it?
It's the in router that's starting.
Cool.
Does that use open VPN for connectivity?
I've opened providers right off.
I'm still waiting on my witty board to show up,
and I did find out this week that the,
that the, that the Benapai router is actually working,
at least the point.
I, silly me, I was expecting to plug,
to plug into the LAN port into my network
and have it show up as another device.
It's not, it's not pulling anything on the LAN side,
but if I plug a host into the one of the LAN ports,
then, yeah, it's, it's doing DHCP.
And I can go to the home page and get to the login.
So it is actually, and in fact, I had HDMI cable on,
and when it was going through grub and everything,
I had a text on the screen, and it disappeared,
you know, when you would have gotten to a login place.
So, you know, I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure, probably,
and I've, I've got one of the open WRTs on it.
So, probably that would be an option,
if I wanted to enable it, is to, you know, run,
actually, actually enable video,
and access the router directly.
So, what are you doing with here, Benanapai?
What's its, uh, 10-inch purpose?
Well, it's one of the, it's the Benanapai router model.
So, it's got the, uh, my, my intended purpose,
which I started out on a quest last fall,
and slowly working my way towards it,
is trying to, to use a free software
to set up security at home,
like you would have at a business,
or a web host, or something like that.
In other words, you know, have, uh,
not only a firewall, but have some connection monitoring,
monitoring with, uh, snort and et cetera.
You know, whatever I can, whatever I can get,
it's open-source and install freely on the box.
I would, I know that, that would be a lot easier.
I, I p, I may try IP fire.
That's the closest thing that actually has an arm port,
and, uh, last I read on it, there was a bug in there,
but it may, uh, if I hit that bug,
all I have to do is re-image the card and start over,
well, actually the, the, uh, uh,
if I hit the particular bug,
it would, it would, it would actually be a deal breaker,
so it would start over something else.
I could also, you know, start from scratch.
Also, you might want to consider looking into, uh,
antibiotics if you've got that problem.
No.
Well, I do have antibiotics in the cabinet,
so that's, so that's always a, uh, an option.
I was just thinking one person we've been missing here
all day is Jonathan.
And for all the, uh, Ruckus, the tilt skies
made about not having, not having the new year show,
I don't think any of them have been in the day,
unless it was when I was, uh, away from the keyboard.
I haven't heard any of them.
Okay, I should, I should have included you there, Lord D.
I was, but, uh, you know, when, when I came on and said,
well, yeah, I don't think we're going to do the show,
you know, rich and, and, uh,
Dan and everybody's, you know, we're, you know,
very vocal about the, about that,
not liking that idea.
So I'm just wondering where they've been all day.
So rich, consulting, often.
Yeah, that would be reason for some sulking.
Well, I know he was trying to get the old job back, uh,
and I knew he had a contract.
So I hope he's not clear down the unemployed again.
Hey, y'all, I'll be back here in about 10 minutes.
All right, we look forward to it.
Have some pirate.
Been eating projects.
Um, not so many.
Uh, there's, there's been some, I guess, but,
not in as much detail.
I, uh, you know, really this, this year,
we've centered a lot more around media than, uh,
than in previous years and not very much, uh,
tech otherwise, uh, and, and no food discussions that I,
I think I've been party too.
So that's, you know, first, first times for everything.
I'm with Fedora and one of this.
Yeah, I look forward to watching that.
Uh, I've, uh, you know,
whenever scales come up and it came up there in the day again today, uh,
I said, well, you know, Matt's going to be out there.
Go buy and say hi.
Yeah, that's one of my first resolutions is to get the,
get the ones I've recorded this year up,
up and going on HPR.
Hello, everybody.
Hello.
This is London calling.
London calling.
Well, hello, uh, we heard, uh, there were, uh,
fireworks, uh, as per usual when you guys hit the, uh, new years.
I'm afraid that I did not see any of the fireworks as I was in a
metal club, uh, just being served a cider at the stroke of midnight.
Whereabouts of London are you hailing us from?
Well, well, I was in Camden, uh, but I'm now
further west in London awaiting a train home.
Ah, that would explain the noise.
Yes, please accept my apologies.
I'm hopeful that push-to-talk works well in the Android version of mumble.
Yeah, it seems to work fairly well.
Are you using clumble then or is the, uh, stock app?
The, the first thing that came up on the Google Play store for mumble.
Well, you sound really good.
Ah, that's good.
I'm using a signage of mod or, well, a variant thereof on my OnePlus 1,
and it seems to be pretty decent hardware.
I am my, uh, raw Xeroist tablet, I think.
If I think I've ever met a player on my phone,
so it might work on that, actually, a bit better.
So, Joe, are you a regular HPR-lister?
I'm afraid that I am not a regular HPR-lister.
I have been known to be a contributor, but, um, it's not on my feed list, I must say.
Well, welcome to the celebration.
Thank you very much. It's, uh, 3.34 am where I am.
At me.
Well, it's 9.30 and change where I am, so, uh, I've got a few hours to catch up.
West Coast?
No, Century, United States, Kansas.
Um, I'm afraid my maths isn't very good at this time of night.
I'd be six hours behind you.
Unfortunately, I have to work this evening, so I have been in route.
Well, have, uh, safe evening then.
Yes, uh, but the company was nice enough to, uh, let me show up four hours late,
so I think it'll get a bit of a break.
I have to start at midnight instead of 8 p.m.
Yes.
So, what's being talked about this evening, man?
Visimary, privacy, security, that sort of thing?
Well, uh, Lord D was just asking, uh, what new projects were starting that we're going to continue
on into the new year.
I guess you could say, uh, you know, what, what,
what things have we started that were resolved to fit to, to finish this year?
Anyone have any answers for that?
Well, I'm going to keep working on my ongoing, uh, security project.
I want to set up my new, uh, my home network with, uh, uh,
whatever security utilities, open source provides me that, you know, to make it, to make it, uh,
more like a business network or, uh, web host, you know, somebody expecting attack,
you know, rather than just your off the shelf router, which I have now.
Also, uh, I started a project a while back.
I expect to finish getting, uh, Nagios on a Raspberry Pi for, uh, for, uh, more network monitoring.
And I have several podcast worth of content for HPR, which I recorded,
going to conferences this year that I really haven't, uh, done my proper diligence in getting
it, you know, out of my head and out of the recording and on, onto an HPR.
So I, I resolved to double down on that.
No, no, we haven't seen him.
I don't think, in fact, I don't know the last time I've heard from him.
Normally, number of apps actually look a fish in the gameplay stuff.
Actually, he makes stuff he does as well.
Well, why we're, you know, like we're discussing earlier, one of the reasons we do this podcast
or this, uh, New Year's Eve show is there's a lot of us that are on, you know,
different podcasts and stuff.
And we see each, you know, we email and we, we talk on IRC, but, uh, there's this, you know,
one time a year that everybody gets together and talks to everybody.
Um, and we haven't seen the new barrels at all, at all this year, which is I think of,
think of first.
Yeah, this is pretty neat.
I didn't think of joining the mumble.
Unfortunately, I'm tied to an iPhone, uh, not by my choice, but I couldn't listen to the stream
on it. So I fired up mumble.
Yeah, and we don't have a dedicated listing booth, but, uh, you know, as long as we're not running
out of spaces in mumble, which, you know, does, has not been a problem this year.
Anybody who wants to just jump in and listen is more than welcome.
We'd rather hope you'd contribute and talk, uh, but, uh, you know, if you don't think like you have
anything you want to say, then, you know, certainly, listing is an option.
So the, the biggest issue that I have seen around the, the Linux and FOS and, and broader
tech ecosystem and media sphere this year has been privaciting that, and it's something
that, basically any discussion seems to keep coming back to, and the conclusion that I've come to
do is that, oh, there it is. Sorry. Sorry. All right, Jill, uh, Red, you might want to talk.
As I was saying, the, the, the conclusion that I've come to leave, as well as your average person
who buys a, can I continue, or is there some echo happening from my end?
You're fine. It's not on your end, Joe. It's, um, red, doesn't have a headset plugged in.
I'm guessing. So when he unmutes the, uh, and he also has speak to talk on.
So unless he has a mic, he's picking up and no turning on his mic.
And he's very, very difficult to speak when that happens.
And he's got some kind of audio stream going on in the background. So I think that,
that's triggering, triggering his mic as well. But it looks like, I think he's, uh,
working on configuring plumble to use, uh, uh, push to talk.
Okay, well, let me continue for now then. So where I was was that privacy is a huge issue
for the, the geek community as, you know, let's, let's call it out the nerds, the Linux users,
the, the FOS advocates, the kind of people who are here. But it's also become an issue for
the wider community of the rest of the world with things like the NSA leaks of the last
couple of years. And it, it seems to me that it's become a big issue. However,
the only solutions that I have seen have come from our community. But they haven't been
sufficiently easy to use. That the average person can actually implement them. And as a result,
Joe, I actually have in my hand device, the little easier for the, and it's a device from Gwen,
router that comes leoporys DMC, I think it's called on them and also shipped with a PN setup on it.
So literally, I can plug the, who my router on the land side connect to this wireless. And I've
already got a connection, you know, out of my house set up and going with very little work on my part.
That sounds absolutely brilliant and absolutely well suited to the kind of person that would be in
this mumble room right now. However, to, to say that I'm going to give that to my brother or my
parents or my uncle and expect them to know what to do with it, I, I just can't see it somehow.
Right, the average person is not going to be buying the routers from, I think Penguin,
unfortunately, until we have this cross the board, you know, where the, where the industry itself
backs encryption. And we get rid of this idea that everything has to have a back door.
We're, we're going to continue to have this problem and welcome FXB. It's been ages.
Well, silence from FXB, but in, in retort to that, that's the problem is that those kind of
routers, routers, as you would say, are easily available for those who know. But do you know anyone
who isn't the kind of person who would come into this mumble room right now, who has ever bought
a router in their life? Most people, 90, you know, 99 plus percent of people get their
router from their ISP and never even think about changing it. They never even think about changing
the password on it, never mind the firmware on it or indeed the, the, the router itself.
Well, there have been, and I just figured out, I'm flumble, and I've done people ideal or slightly
more tech, you know, even if it's a game, go out and buy a doctor's modem to get a router
themselves. You know, I'm, and hasn't, you know, Google actually been talking about enabling
default encryption on Gmail. So, you know, it, it's, it's, it may be coming slowly to the consumer
level. But yeah, it's, it's going to have to start in the geek community because most of us,
everything we do is pretty much in the open. So if we're going to defeat built-in back doors
everywhere, we're just going to have to encrypt in, in, in software as much as we can. And,
you know, it would be nice, you know, if maybe developers started to have an eye towards that,
like, like mumble. If there was, if there was a way to encrypt communications, of course,
anybody can join. Also, IRC, I assume there's probably, it's encrypted if you use the SSL port.
But since, you know, if anybody in the NSA could could join any, any channel on free
node. So I'm not sure how much point there is, but yeah, they're going forward. I think we really
do need to start designing things encrypted by default. Well, you talk about Google there.
Wasn't there a story there of how Facebook's chat now involved in the personal site?
Yes, yes. But you talk about Google there and how they are
championing into an encryption. And I'm sure that as a company, the size of Google,
has a number of people working within that organization who are free software advocates,
potentially FSF die hard people who really care about that stuff. But the problem is that
something like Gmail cannot exist if end to end encryption exists as a, a standard feature.
Because Google can't make money if every email that sent either from or to Gmail is encrypted,
because they can't then sell adverts on top of that. So it's not in Google as a company's
interest for them to implement end-to-end encryption. But what are we supposed to think when they
tell us one thing they say they support end-to-end encryption? Are they just going to drop the
adverts in email and just go with the search, their Google searches and have advertisements in that,
just wondering. I think it's easy to think about Google as a single entity because that's
effectively what we see. But the fact is a massive company made up of hundreds and thousands of
people working within the company. And I'm sure I'm 100% sure that there are people who work within
Google who are fully committed to printing. We lose Joe. Thanks, though. Apparently so, I mean,
not to put words in this mouth. If Google says they have end-to-end privacy on Gmail,
do we trust them? If they're doing the encryption who's to say they're not
pulling the content out to use it for targeted advertising before they encrypt it and send it on.
And what do we do in end-to-end encryption? A Gmail log-aiding all of that. They work with it.
They wouldn't be pulling a lot of things. Yeah, they're going to pull their data. They're going to
get their information, you know, every way they can get it. They're going to do it. Gmail just might
be that one part. But if you log in, I'm sitting here with my Chromebook and my laptops sitting here,
I'm signing into my Chromebook. They got me. They know everything I'm looking at, everything I'm
doing, every game I play, every website I go to, every video I seek. So, you know, there's no way
around that on the Chromebook. Yeah, exactly. Gmail is just the log-in, whereas all of the other
products are points of data. And we have seen, as I say, we have seen the encrypted email pay services,
then I say shows up before warrant and they just flatfold, which is the only thing they can
do. So, we do need to work towards a new paradigm. But big corporations are probably not
exactly the answer, but they may at least be sort of a start. They'll probably be giving us more
faults than security than any kind of real security. Yeah, but you talk about how Gmail is
almost a minor part of it because you've got search and Google plus and all the rest of it.
But the thing is that whatever you search for, you might possibly be interested in, but things
that get emailed to you are things that you have already signed up to and therefore you are
definitely interested in. I mean, I book a flight with British Airways and it shows if in my
calendar because they know I'm definitely flying with British Airways. Well, I've noticed, you know,
lack of a firewall between Facebook and Google plus because, you know, I'm 5150 on Google plus.
That's because the email was originally through a Google Domains account, so they don't question
that it's not a real name. And then Facebook, I'm, you know, my, the name is on my gift certificate.
But when I'm in G plus and it says you may want to follow and it's people that I went to high school
and college with, you know, something is in which I keep separate. Something is definitely being
intentionally leaked through the firewall. But the question is, why is it being leaked through there?
Is it some sinister reason that you can't explain or is it a simple as cash? Is it as simple as
they're trying to gather as much data as they can so they can sell you things that you might want to buy?
Oh, yeah, sure. It's kind of fine, whatever they get. Yeah, that's all it is. I go on Amazon,
I'm looking at a Fitbit. Five minutes later, I'm in my feedlead account. I'm reading a story
and up pops an ad for a Fitbit from Amazon or whatever. Yeah, see, I use, uh, and I hate to admit this,
but it is one of the first services out there for Wedden Mail. I use Yahoo Mail as the, as my mail,
again, under, under my given name. And if I, if I look up something on Amazon, you know,
then the next day I look at my mail, it's, you know, it's right there in my Yahoo Mail. But isn't Yahoo
Microsoft these days? They're supposed to be with Bing, but they were going to switch. And FXB,
you know, if you could, if you could increase your gain a little bit, you're, you're a little low.
How do I sound? How do I sound? I'm fucking around with Blum Blum. Yes, I'm doing the same thing.
How does this sound? You sound great, Rich. How is my, how's my gain, Chamberlain?
This is completely default. I installed the mumble app from the Play Store and my phone about
20 minutes ago, half an hour ago. Same with me. First time ever on this new phone. Just like you
phoned and roamed in the last, just to install, destroyed my plumbing. Yeah, that's where I got it.
Oh, well, I just installed mumble with an M just totally standard from the Google Play Store.
Within a version of Signature Mod, but with the Google Apps installed. And well, you'd be the
judge of how it sounds. Great. I mean, the mumble app actually that came from the people who
write the mumble application used to be absolute rubbish. So I think you've proved that maybe they've
done some some improvements. You know, Plumble is like a third party. And that's whatever everybody
has been falling back to for a couple of years now. Yeah, I've just flipped to the Google Play
on this remix thing. And so there was two mumbles, which was the confusing plus Plumble. One, three,
one isn't. I just tried Plumble on that tablet. And I think it's going to work. So I'm stuck
quickly. So if it sounds bad. So I think I'm going to have to say either. There are several
clients for Android available most of prior to Plumble, but be the one that's
so yeah, so, so, so, so sorry to interrupt. So whatever your actual name is, I using a remix mini
by any chance. Not not a man, but I was going to try it on the remix. I was a tablet. I've
got to have a remix mini because I can't handle that. But I, but there's better like, it doesn't
seem to work on the muclumb or anywhere on the remix. So I was tapped up for it to see if it
would break. So the tablet got really bad over there when the computer had in there. But this is
what I have to say. I don't know if it had bad results. But yeah, I use, I use Plumble on the
remix mini all the time to listen to tilts. You know, because the, the TV in here is pretty
sound, sound speakers. So I don't, I don't recall if I've ever used it with a headset, but
definitely seems to work as a audio monitor through Plumble.
And there's two devices that I have just to be clear if I'm not being clear enough. So there's
the remix mini, which was this year's Figma. They have on it. And there's also last year's
thing, which is a remix. Oh, it's a tablet, which is quite nice. Quite big, bigger than the iPad.
But I was just trying out on the tablet, Plumble, but I don't think I can get sound for some reason.
Same. Yeah, that's amazing.
There's one audio port on the back of the audio output. So it had full pull.
Yeah, that's the problem I had with it. I believe it does. Well, no, I'm certain it's got the
four-pole audio, but you know, when I've got the audio going out through HDMI, that's all I
seem to be able to get. In other words, if I plug speakers into the audio port, I'm not getting
anything. Yeah, but we're talking about the mini on the tablet, because there's two things.
The mini. Yeah, that's not the actual tablet that I have, not the mini. I'm saying I have
mini as well, two mini's actually. I still kind of need to connect to the TV. And actually
do something with it, but I'm going to hand the race with all the buses in the room so I don't
be take up much space. Can I just say that it's amazing to be sitting on a mumble room with people
who actually know what the remix mini and remix tablet are? It's quite remarkable, because I thought
that, yeah, okay, it's all to a few thousand, but of all the people in all of the mumble rooms
on the internet, to meet people who've actually had a hands-on with the same thing that I have
this quite remarkable. I was going to say definitely you showed up in the right room,
so it would say him yes. I've also got a pine 64. I've also got a pine 64 on the way,
or at least I crowdfunded it, which is pretty much essentially the same board, except, you know,
not in a case, and where you could actually install whatever OS you wanted on it. Well,
whatever open OS you wanted. No, so good. I was a chip for the $9 mini PC after I went to
a mate, because that's like, because I'm getting the additional things with that. But that's not
that. Yeah, that's like a devian thing, like a, like a pocket PC thing. It's a lot of
like a mini TV and PC, when that comes, I think. Well, it's probably a bit like a relatively
priming, but this is popular, I think. I mean, they're quite clear. I also got a dreamer for
the board, and I'm going to see when that comes. There's a few issues with their funding,
and I also had an issue with something I crap on the day earlier this year. I took that
out here earlier. There she was, and this guy was not something I really paid for out as well,
because he's trying to get me to pay for additional things. And I actually know, in real life,
from Kansas Linux Fest, the chief technical officer for the AI project, Sherlock Holmes,
more intelligent brother. I don't know what probably this is the micraft. Yes, this is definitely
the the scotch talking at this time of night. But yeah, I've got a micraft AI on the way.
I am hoping for this podcast. Well, not hoping. I'm definitely going to do good. I said I was
going to do it this fall. I'm definitely going to drive up to Lawrence, Kansas this spring,
because you know, at the Kansas Linux Fest, we were actually in or visited the the maker
place where the microsoft or where the micraft microsoft. That's a big frudian switch. But where
the micraft AI was developed, I did realize at the time I was actually kind of looking in an
earlier version, because they were they had a 3-D printed mic thing that had software running,
you know, sort of as a touring test type deal. So you could ask questions, and it would try to
answer you like a human. So I definitely since I knew the people behind that, I definitely funded
that project and looking forward to getting mine this spring. Those are going to come, Mr.
but 50 150, you're funding all these projects. How do you have time to farm? Sometimes I wonder,
but yeah, this is... Anybody talking? It seems like something dropped out.
Yeah, Jay, just glad to see you. What did you say about farming?
I just said this has been a really good year for some very interesting crowdfunding projects,
and sometimes I wonder how I have time to farm and mess around with all my new toys at the same time.
I agree with that that it's been an interesting year for crowdfunding. I mean, I've only really
funded, let's see, one, two, three, four projects, but we've only got so much money.
Fair worth to do that with, but that has been some interesting stuff definitely, and I'm wondering
what 2016 is going to bring when it comes to crowdfunding, but like how is your own
trusting projects don't exist usually, because that rubbish is what I'm showing crowdfunding.
If you look, it's like, do I really want to crowdfund this or that, not really,
for that, but occasionally you get some really good projects, really interesting stuff, stuff that
could change a little if I'm looking at the popular.
Oh yeah, because you get into one and then you start getting links for the
other similar projects and say, I already did this one, you know, I came really close,
because it looked really good. I can't remember the name of the project, but it was like a 16-core
HDMI TV card. One of those portable HDMI out computers where you carry it in your pocket,
and you plug it in the back of the TV, and it's a computer, but you know, at right on
200 bucks, and that was, that seemed a little pricey right now.
There's a little device that you just plug in your TV now, I hope to make it all,
so that it makes many of those as well. There's lots of this now, and the quote,
even stuff doesn't crowdfunding, the quote, and cast there, and things like that.
Has anybody tried that new kangaroo computer that came out a couple of months ago and tried
no, I don't even know about Lamarza. Say again, excuse me. I didn't even know about Lamarza.
I don't know, I read a story on Paul Therott's website where he got a kangaroo computer.
It's about as big as a little Roku puck. Basically, you can plug it into any type of tablet,
plug in a keyboard, and there you have a computer, but he was using it with iOS,
and Windows 8. I was trying to find out if somebody had been able to put Linux on it and
blow away the Windows 8. I don't know if anybody can. So it's called a kangaroo computer,
and it's a small computer you can set your mouse to keyboard and so on.
Yep, that's it, kangaroo. We've seen a couple of stories, but nothing else.
Haven't seen anybody try to work on it. They just go with iOS and Windows 8,
there's 10 iOS, so do you mean the, no, probably the rest of them. I think there's a look of
thing from Mac, and that Mac OS X PC, but on the factory. Yeah, I think I remember seeing the
articles on it, but I think it's one of those things everybody said, we'll wait for XDA or
somebody to tell us how to put Linux on it before we go look at it. I mean, there is a lot of
interesting Windows tablets and small Windows computers, and we all think, well, if it runs Windows,
it's going to have to run a Linux ISO, but there are certain devices that resist tampering
with the home operating system, so when I come across something like that, I always want to see
where somebody else is broke at first before I drop my money on it.
Even the Remix, so not the Remix Mini, because that's more their own thing, but the thing they
had the previous year, the Remix OS tablet, that, I bet some really good reviews about that as well,
but I mean, if you look at it, we'll look at that one. There's no soft surface pose, because you've
got a detachable keyboard, and all that metallic keyboard, but yeah, you were saying this and
give Windows tablets, but there's also some good Chinese copies of these kind of tablets now,
ready? I'm looking at the kangaroo mobile desktop computers, Intel,
X-ray 5, Zulu, 8, 5, 0, 0, $99 has Windows 10 on it, they're sold out, two gigabytes,
a RAM, 32 gigabytes, SSD, Intel, HD graphics, and it has a kangaroo in it.
There's got a lot of minis coming out, and tablet, or already available, have roughly that,
and the hardware relative one is most cohesive, even though they are suppressive, they actually
can be listed, as he was speaking. Yeah, I'd heard that on the tablets. I hadn't realized
these small atom computers, some of them share that a similar drawback. So that just reinforces,
if you're looking at one of these little computers and saying, well, it ought to run Linux,
you probably need to do your due diligence and find an article where somebody says,
this is A, B, and C, how you get Linux running on this box. I mean, I've been thinking about
the Remix Mini, surely probably, if I wanted to crack the case open, I would find that there's
just an SD card in there, and probably the Pine 64, I think is almost identical hardware,
so probably if I were to grab an image and it designed for the Pine 64 install, I would probably
have a little Linux box, but the Pine 64 didn't know that we'd pay. No, no, the Pine 64
version, you're going to discuss if you was saying something about halfway to your point, I think.
Yeah, you were talking about the 32-bit UEFI versus the 64-bit operating system, making it very
difficult to install Linux on one of those little anim boxes. Yeah, I mean, the tablet is available
roughly and it actually fires in the hard part, do that with a bit of flexing around. The hard part
of getting the network, audio, work it out. It's the same old story, it's a lot of arm tablets,
drivers are proprietary. Yeah, although some of them are the Baytrails Strange AC,
people prefer the hard part. Sorry, I was just looking at filling in some stuff on the shared
show notes. Well, again, what about that? Well, it's very cheap, very cheaper than the
Raspberry Pi price, and that's pretty quite good, and there was a mustache as well, I think it was
like if you join the Raspberry Pi magazine, you can get one for you on the cover. That's very cheap,
anyway. Yep, did manage to snag what that. Well, it already get it to boot, it takes binary blobs,
I mean, not just for audio or video or anything, just to get it to boot. Yeah, I don't like that about
it. That's what it's very good from. At least, yeah, I think quite a hit out. Sorry,
say that again, I think quite had it properly. Not from the account, it was okay. Well, I think
the zero is a great solution for somebody building robotics or embedded systems or whatever,
but every time somebody says, well, if we want to add all the interfaces that the regular
Raspberry Pi already has, your way past the investment on just buying a pie, but not, you know,
for somebody wants to do projects, it'd be great. And I haven't got to that point yet. I'm just,
I'm just my single board computers. I'm just using them as regular desktops.
Well, for what you're interested is embedded at the same price range, you have the chip, which is,
you know, like I said, same price at it actually runs a fully free and upstream kernel.
Right. The chip was mentioned earlier today, and I wanted to tie those to do a comparison.
I love the idea of this, but I need something I can order on my hands at every order. Oh, by the way,
well, if you're talking about a track from the chip, which, yeah, I did have it from that. So,
after going to a maybe, because I've got, I've said, have you had additional
listen, that, what it as well? So I've got to go into a maybe, but that's okay.
Did that put me off? They went for a crowd, and then they started, when, when are we actually?
Yeah, just seeing that, it's just seeing the interesting, though, before it was on the campaign. So,
I mean, so hopefully it's actually interesting, when I hope you actually get that thing.
Yeah, I kind of worry about get, which is basically the second round of Nidah Manning now.
But clarifying is great, until the issue is getting where you have to get, which happened a
little time as well. Well, it's like this web mentioned earlier, you have, you know, more than one
problem with it. First is that an outright scam, and if it isn't, you know, does the developer
are, are they overly optimistic about their development costs? Well, I mean, that thing, that a bunch
of have put out this product through crowdfunding supply, that was actually based like,
Raspberry's a camera, it's still going to throw them to gifts, but only the crowdfunding has
got one of them. They didn't offer them as a product, and now they're saying they're going to
offer this as a product, and the volume's possibly going to make to the intro they found
through the crowd, like the cast, the cost, what they're asking, and the other thing they've
been talking about, they've got over a year, and they've gone and announced a crowdfunding round,
what everyone thought was the orders, and that to be done, nobody's. Yeah, so,
okay, Jola thing, and thinking, the orders of the chip, just did a Jola thing. Jola was,
and the other thing, Jola, Jola, I kind of found that last December 2014, and now they can't
just hand the tablet out, because they're called problems with their investor, and I'm wondering
if we're going to get that tablet. But, well, the tip of that one, you were talking about having
like a second round of funding chip, what Jola, what they're doing is funding a lot of the funds
on the actual operating system update, so, they have, and investors drop down or something,
and it's all a bit like it is, I was really going to get this Jola tablet or not, no, it's
supposed to have been not called it, and that in my other point, you said that everybody's
campaigning the chip, that only the investor had, so that only people in crowdfunding got
that, or whichever one it was. I was just going to say, we're doing the remix mini, which we've
just been mentioning, even that one. Apparently, the one gig that I had, so I've actually got both,
I've got one gig that I don't know, and two gig that, but the one with less was only offered
on the crowdfunding campaign, as you all know, there's going to be a gem cell that I've had somewhere.
That only the camera next to go to a making, and it was only the crowdfunding got that,
and they never saw product, just what they promised a chip, and they've done the crowdfunding,
and then they're asking, this isn't a bit odd, another crowdfunding product.
Well, yes, in that way, something else too, it's like a little crowdfunding campaign,
and then it went in demand, so yes, this can happen, but then pretty much straight away,
they're there, but the people there as well.
You went here and I talked about the one that I come from you to that I've had issues with,
because the guy wouldn't send it, because I basically said, end up being on him and he said,
he went from me, because that was a tablet that I'm talking about, and I've got actually got one
that I basically contributed to, it was on one of the sites, and I did a few months ago,
it was like a cheap tablet, and I, and we know the issue, the campaign didn't say so much,
what it was, like Andrews and Cheney, whether him or her operating system, I emailed the guy,
and then it's like, you're supposed to claim your tablet, your tablet, but then there was a problem
with that, you had to attach email, and then I kind of say, I don't know, I won't be sure what I
get in here, and I was thinking of, um, possibly doing the Patreon thing where you get two tablets,
and you first have your main part on the website as well. And, um, so the second idea that he
starts off from me, the, um, our pet basically had discounted price, it was apparently a discount,
and a good girl apparently, or whatever he said, thanks to his email discussion, I found that
a bit more about things, I mean, some of this wasn't even honest, so like, you know,
specifically he will play that show in the Patreon part, but that turns out only actually works
in Singapore, I was told an email as well, which is a bit like really, and he really never met
such like, he was so more stuff to me, so he's like, can I update your account, you know, there's,
so yesterday, he's going to, I basically said, send me all this other stuff and I'll pay him
more for it, and I'll end up doing this, I mean, I ran sentence, and then I basically thought,
I know, I don't know all this other stuff, I thought I've got a bit, but, um, he just
did respond for a length later, and then he started to send these tablets out, and then he's
basically refusing to send anything out at all, including what I'd already paid for, and
I'm just, you know, it's like, laughing or nothing, so I just don't know if I'm supposed to
laugh to emails, but I kind of need to do something about that, I'm ready. The account
needs a password and Singapore work that I pay for, but it doesn't want to open up, and I'm just
sending that out. Yeah, it doesn't matter, or it can't be, I mean, because some of the people
let me maybe continue with it. I can't really afford to invest in technology
crowdfunding campaigns, it's sometimes entertaining trying to pick out the ones that doing
genuinely might not be. It's a good idea crowdfunding for tech and stuff, but
with our little potential issues, what can go wrong, what might go wrong with this?
In the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the year, where, um, XM4 is a good one, because
they came out with a yoga phone, they did that, took a while when they passed,
I would feel a mock at people in there, sort of a bit like questionable if people are
looking to get the type of letter that I cannot goal it.
Yeah, if you can't afford to lose the money, then don't eat this.
Through that.
If you come and fail to lose the money, then you don't contribute to campaign.
Well, yeah, I agree with that.
I think it's wrong.
No delay, but it's that way.
Away.
Away.
Away.
Away.
I'm watching American football, Alabama versus Michigan State.
It looks like it's going to be Clemson versus Alabama for the national championship.
Sports ball.
Oh, you beat me that part.
Well, does anybody try to get the Amazon fire tablet that cheap when they were selling
for $40 some dollars and try to put Android on it?
Uh, maybe.
Yeah, they've been trying to sell them like in the UK as well with various TV athletes.
I haven't seen them for a while, but they're really trying to sell five stuff over here as
well.
Yeah, you could buy them in a six pack if you want.
You can get six at a time for $200 even by one for $40 something.
I was thinking about getting one and seeing what I could do with it.
My next is seven is kind of acting walked in.
So they said, well, maybe I can do something with it.
I don't use Amazon that much.
I order stuff, but I don't watch any of the video listening to their music or anything.
So I've seen articles where guys are put on it.
In the end, I just didn't know I'd keep my old mixes up.
Yes, quote.
It's quite cheap.
Do you have fair stab web, but.
Will is is basically Android with Amazon exchanges.
So.
A bit like.
I suppose a bit like what's it called saying model?
Okay.
Well, it's called.
And even remix.
It has to.
Until next time.
Well, you know, it's.
You can source projects so you can come out with various things based on it.
And that's what we're done with five or less.
So sticking and putting Android on it.
Well, I suppose you could try.
But then you just can handle attack by any way.
Yeah, but what.
I don't know if anybody has index of seven.
What I first got mine in 2013.
That was first time I had one of a.
A Google.
A location of Android.
Once you get the Plano Android with none of that extra junk thrown in,
you don't want to go back.
And like I said, I didn't want to go with the Amazon version of Android.
Yeah, I must not supposed to be really get the still handling that's true.
And also these devices are supposed to be pretty good to.
Defends to change the OS.
Different phone operating systems.
I must be the only one here that actually uses a Firefox.
No, no, no.
I brought one back in September.
Very cheap from Amazon.
Docker.
Well, three from a genuine company.
You were selling the French one.
There's no Amazon back there.
Very cheap.
Firefox.
So it's quite nice.
But yeah, it would take you.
And I'm going to have one.
One of the things anyway.
Well, the fire tablets for a while.
They were $35.
But for that $15 savings.
You had to accept watching ads on them.
I almost pulled the trigger.
But right about as I was going to do so.
You know, I think I left it till morning and by then they'd gone back up to $50.
And that included the ads.
That's what you have for $40.
FXB is leaving.
So that's fine.
Yeah.
I got it.
Yeah, FXB.
You're always welcome back on Colonel Pancon cast.
As you know, we've had some changes lately.
But you don't jump back in anytime you feel like it.
Oh, definitely.
Nobody can get Peggy's ass in here.
I was about to say, I don't think that's possible.
Oh, we've got to do something.
Tell them to get the helmet back on.
Well, see, we never should have let him.
We never should have let him take the helmet off.
That's how we did the mind control.
Anyway, I'll catch up with you.
I have a good one.
Yes.
Oh, I see Joe's back.
You guys are just talking about a minute.
I thought maybe Joe caught the train he was waiting for.
I don't know.
I haven't heard him about 20 minutes.
I'm back at home.
But my wife is asleep.
Yeah.
Don't risk waking her up on our account.
It's not worth it.
I put a little message in the chat there.
I got nothing.
It was about 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, just really.
I'm just waiting for the time to come here.
I think we got 23 minutes.
I was going to say though that you guys are talking about Debian
and presumably you have spoken about this
and I don't want to go into it too much.
But I think that we need to mark
the passing of Ian Murdoch tonight.
It was only a couple of days ago and what actually happened
doesn't really matter but the fact that
of what he did with Debian
and the fact that he's no longer with us
I think deserves to be acknowledged.
Yeah.
So we talked about it.
Oh, I'm surprised.
Go ahead, 50 minutes.
Oh, did that come up earlier when I was away from the keyboard?
Yeah, it was.
I think guys were just generally talking around
about 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time early this morning.
There were only a couple guys on.
They just happened to mention
and basically some of the tweets
and it was just a general discussion.
I must have missed some major listings
because I had me looking at the last two, three days.
Well, Ian Murdoch committed suicide Monday evening.
As it come out that they said, he committed suicide.
That's what all the news sources are saying at this point.
I don't think it's official
but if you look at his Twitter profile
well, that's now being deleted.
But if you looked over the last three days
he was talking about that he was going to do it
and he had some police brutality
and so it seems very clear to me at least
that that's what happened, unfortunately.
It is admittedly slightly suspicious though
but yeah, either way, it's not cool.
I'm looking at this article on the Guardian.
I don't think they haven't said a call.
They just said to the tribute.
Well, the thing is that despite the fact
that this time of year for me
is the best time at all of year
because I have a lot of time off work.
I can concentrate on the projects that I want to do
and I can relax and have a few drinks and do what I want.
But for an awful lot of people
this is a very stressful time of year
and it's a time that suicides,
the depression really hit the peak
and it seems that it could combine that
with potentially some police brutality
that may have pushed in over the edge
and it's incredibly sad that he took a permanent solution
to what was potentially a temporary problem.
Yeah, I think it is tragic
and recently the FCC
has underestimated the power of this community
when they wanted to regulate routers
and potentially general computing devices.
I think we had within the community
we had a great deal of uproar a couple years ago
with Aaron Schwartz
and if it looks like this is a case
of some trumped up charges
that he was facing,
I think it may be possible
that the police involved have way underestimated
the community they've perhaps taken on.
I don't want necessarily say
we want to go adversarial on this
but I definitely think we want to go investigative
and find as much out as possible.
I am in complete agreement with that.
I agree also, but you know how things go.
We all have good intentions
but the government is the government.
I really don't see beating the government
at their own game.
Alright, so check out the paceman
they dropped into the chat right there.
That's the tweets and question.
I really didn't want to try and drag all of this stuff up
and stuff it.
For me mentioning in was born of a
how can I put it?
Let's remember the great work that he did
and mourn is passing
but I think it's too early to start trying to dig
over all the details
and I wonder exactly what happened.
For me it's just let's remember him
and let that be enough for now.
I mean his contribution cannot be
underestimated
because you could say maybe not fully half
but there are, you know,
most distributions out there are either branched
from Debian or from Red Hat
and with this mattering of independence
and it would not be wrong to say
half the distros we use are nearly half
of us come from Ian Murdoch's contribution.
I agree, everything I use is Debian derivative.
I use Debian derivative probably
about a quarter of the time these days.
I'm not even better than him
because doing love other stuff
on this year in a way
and haven't quite set this computer up.
I want that.
But Pat, that's also to do with the UFI
some extent.
Because in the morning I can't do it
quite how I want it to
with it coming up first with Grap
and also if I want to
win those times
or let me go and do them again
just telling him
bother to do much for this computer.
Although I will add something else here
this is actually a HVZS
that you'd think
oh well that's a band
it's supposed to be kind of good
but actually a little
of the time it comes up
saying it overheats
when it gives
and suspends or
hibernation mode
comes up with a screen saying
that it's basically
going to family
shut down
it's okay now
and that's not really good
as I
confirm people
that's worth a little
quite a lot of money
what's supposed to be?
Well I for one
I've actually just decided
I'm going to start Debian
and run that for the next week.
I mean
it's probably about the best
tribute I can do.
To me the best tribute
is to use
upon two
or even the next mint
because
the
the legacy
is really
the most important thing to me
and that Debian
in of itself
is a powerful operating system
but the things
that
canonical have done
and clamors
done with Linux Mint
and the countless
other derivatives
are testament
to how
rock solid
Debian is
and all the work
that Ian
put into that
to found it.
You know that
it's
to me it's about the legacy
and
it's fair enough
you can
run straight Debian
as a tribute
but even
running something
like a Linux Mint
Cinnamon desktop
to me
is enough
because that says
you know
that really pays tribute
to the work
that Debian has done
over the past 20
audios.
How do we get that
Debian
T-shirt
logo T-shirt
wasn't
minimal
pricing
up there was
Debian
You have the
Sosa side of things
but I mean
inner suits
Yeah, but Suza as well is as his links to Greta, as does my GAO, I'm going to read you
have one, I'm going to read it like it's really existed with this 20 more, but it's near
the RPM list for those of the link to Greta in that sense. So yeah, I was about half the
district looking to have a link to Davi and some of the other or Greta, which was 51,
if he's kind of never got a small list of those, like Gen 2 and all that, they're different.
Not to mention solar, so yes, or more than natural, either way you selected the Linux community
or as a great tribute to the guy. Definitely, but I think that dwelling on him and his life
is probably not what he would have wanted and to try and progress things and continue
with Davi and derivatives. And indeed, things like solar, so yes, it's probably the best
tribute that we can give to him that things continue and the work that he did to bring
people into the Linux world. I mean, I wouldn't be talking to you guys now if it wasn't
for Davi. But that's not to say that we have to dwell and get depressed about it. Things
move forward and that's probably what he would have wanted.
Because of Ubuntu, I think it's probably what we're 70% of people get into Linux starting
with Ubuntu. So even if you say things, just put down right down the middle between
Davi and the RPM distros, I mean, still counting the independent Slackware and et cetera.
Ubuntu was the gateway distro for most of us. Certainly was for me. So yeah, without Ian,
there would be no Ubuntu. Now, am I wrong in saying that Ian was no longer day-to-day involved
in development? Right. He was working with Doctor. I think he gave a day-to-day development
for Davi in 96 or so.
I just want to say here, to go with 5150, a little bit here. Yeah, the thing is, if Davi
knew Davi and Ubuntu or whatever, there would be things in beginners. And if we go back
to 90s for example, a lot of people actually had their first introduction to Linux using
Mandrake, which let it begin in reverse. So, you know, that little race being something else
if basically. Well, that was my first distro was Mandrake and I was on dial-up and I couldn't
do it really once I got installed. I couldn't do a thing with it because it speeded my connection.
But yeah, you're right. But my second introduction into Linux was definitely with Ubuntu and
I think their efforts to try to make it as dead simple as possible. As much as I question
a lot of canonical decisions lately, I don't think anybody can question the contribution
that Ubuntu has made to getting people into Linux.
Yeah, but to go with it, I was the other point now, you use a family, so it's a bit a bit
of a bit of a baitable, but if you go to Ubuntu, you use a family, that's not quite true
actually compared to some other distribution because there's four clamp all the control
sensors in Mandraever and Magia, PC, so less, even anything in that kind of family. And
open-source has got, yes, which is supposed to be quite good as well. Welcome to Squeezing's
and booting in the next room to be here for Enswell and it has that. So, and that lacks
in Ubuntu, there's never, there's not like a, there's some things lacking that kind of
should be down in the way, but I'm, and that's what I'm trying to say.
Now, that's one thing and I think I would be against, not against, but Ike, you know,
Solace, they're trying to make it a distribution where the average user never has to see the
command line. And every Linux distro, I've ever, I've ever installed package management
is just so much better from the command line than using a graphical tool so that, at least
it, in my opinion, so we talk about yes, yes, yes is a nice tool, it's a nice tool if you
want a web-based package management solution, but, you know, give me a zipper any day over
the years. So, excuse us, obviously. Well, I was just going to say there that you talk
about not needing to go to the command line and Linux meant, to me, specifically the
Cinnamon version and to some extent the Marta version, that is a distribution where the
average user who has never used Linux before and if you set that up for them and set them
in front of it, teach them, they need to do the updates, this is where you get new software
that's what you need to do. I honestly believe that with Linux Mint you don't ever need
to go to the command line and indeed a bunch of the main Unity version, as much as I despise
Unity as a user interface, I think that someone who is new to it would never need to drop
to the command line. I would, as a matter of course, because it's quicker to do things
like an up-get update and just upgrade, but if you've never used the command line before,
I don't think you need to do it and whereas with other distributions you do necessarily
need to do that, I think that's what Ubuntu and derivatives like Linux Mint have, that's
how they've progressed things. In a way, I'd rather not even think the long-span Sandross
and the old days, they were doing user-friendly before even, like that even, didn't it really?
Dreaming went, we just was a claim to distribution anyways, did go into and not buy it really,
based on Debian, but really a point of distribution is that in this case a command line, well,
that really applies to most distributions today, well, last many years, even in the deception
of distributions, of course, Arch Linux and Jens, who are the four, and Slackware distributions,
I generally see in as being for no technical people, but everything else, pretty much everything else,
you haven't really been able to scale the command line for most things for years now,
and that is also quite simply because of upstream projects most as well because they're
all running the same thing. Yeah, but look at Fedora, okay, you can install it and use it for
a web browser, but that's about it, if you want to have any media playback or flash or
anything like that, then you need to drop to the command line to add the various repositories
that you need to install that non-free stuff and the trademark encumbered stuff. So, you know,
Fedora, to me, is the main alternative to the Ubuntu-based ones apart from Gen2 and Arch,
which are more for the advanced user, but for me, and even Susa as well, I don't think that the
average person can use that without a little bit of command line, even if it's just copy-pasting
line-lay.
We're talking in the, yeah, Santa will family, because I'm using the final heads actually,
I'm looking for idea, um, so I've listened to the recording and me speaking of that,
oh, I'm trying to use an internal microphone with laptop, which is not the best.
I've got an internal mic, too, and it's not great, but it's not so overmodulated,
it's like your levels are way too high or you've got mic boost on or something,
but I don't mean to distract from the conversation, sorry.
I wasn't in a judgement call either, I was just trying to type it in the chat, in case you didn't know.
Yeah, we have some super-weather thing we were that say, we've got 30 minutes,
we were really, we don't have to do that.
Well, when, uh, in, uh, Seb Seb's, uh, defense when he came on, he asked how he sounded.
And we said, well, you know, it's maybe a little distorted in feedback, but it's,
It's, uh, listenable, will probably won't detract from the show and, uh, it's kind of gone back
and forth, Pokey, but, uh, yay, generally, uh, his audio has been, uh, at least tolerable, uh,
through, through the show.
