Good day.
This is Lost in Bronx with a Summer Short.
You can contact me at Lost in Bronx at gmail.com and my site is at info-underground.net-lnb.
I want to tell you about one of my personal heroes.
I'm not counting family, of course, but rather someone from time's past.
His name was George Washington Carver.
Born into slavery in the 1800s, he rose to become a world-class biologist and one of the
most important scientists in American history.
His story is one of privation, perseverance, genius, and triumph, and he's someone everyone
ought to know about.
Look him up.
You'll be glad you did.
