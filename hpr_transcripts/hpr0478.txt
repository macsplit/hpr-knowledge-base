only knew as
he's got guys living in all these disparate other countries
who were were right here in front of them and they could ask questions and for
a lot of the guys that was having a little you know it's like
it on that level man great often
but i knew the minute they did that they were never gonna have another one
they were convinced and saying oh we're gonna have another one like you are
never gonna have another one
see your cousin video of so much money on this event
is promotional that and the other thing of course was that they kept calling
themselves the largest
american demo party
and the problem is is that
what they did was it was in a corner
and there were
four or five thousand people
who had the right to walk into that room
but only about a hundred some odd did
and of that hundred only twenty or thirty were there for the whole event
most were just there for the show
would you like in that respect of it to assembly would you say
like assembly you know i mean assembly has a large portion of people there who are
not directly doing demos but it's
big demo event
yeah i mean so there's there's been some reaction to this with blue assembly
and things like that from what i've gathered from other people
everyone loves envy scene i've heard aside from you now i've heard no i
complaints
i don't have any complaints about the event itself
all of mine are purely a case of
not liking the approach like i knew that they were going to just basically try to
Walmart the demo scene
drop a bunch of money pulling a whole bunch of stuff
bring in the best of the best
and then disappear
yes you're seeing this
sucking wound and
it's what happened they're gone
they're not going to have another one
uh... and so the groups around here who have done work will have to either they
will they can either do our
demo party or contribute remotely to other demo parties and so on is no
you know there was no five year plan
for them they were never going to do a five year they may have convinced the
people who are organizing the actual specific event but it was like a demo
party you do
you more than a demo party and and again
it can't i mean it's like
if you win some crazy start-up
and the crazy start-up
rents limos to go anywhere and there's crazy hot tub parties at a big rented
mansion every weekend
you know that they're probably not going to stick around that long
doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy the hot tub parties
and the free drinks in the limo right you know have a great time
just don't get around going man why doesn't everyone do it this way
or
man you guys have to get with the time everyone doing hot tub party limo rides
you know it's like that it was like
i knew them in the grand scheme of things is going to be five block parties in
one nb scene and nb scene was awesome i would love it
if there were other parties
and i'm not saying that in some fake
bullshit i know there aren't any therefore i can say it things
i wish that there were like four
like three really good ones and one that kind of sucked but it was pretty good at
parties so a lot of people go to it
and
bernie has had mentioned a little bit
thinking about hosting i don't know if you've approached you
because he came to me for whatever reason and i said well you should talk to
Jason about this
about hosting one at hope
have you heard of this
that was mentioned to me in this kind of man we ought to do one at hope
yeah yeah that's how it's meant to be
yeah man we ought to do this at hope
i don't know it's like
hey we ought to do a field trip to the planetarium
i mean planetariums are awesome
and the fact is that yeah they could have a really good demo party at hope
they certainly have the space there's a
there's a couple places where they can have them
i don't know how willing they are to do it quote-unquote
right yeah and they tend to stumble on those kind of logistics
like they're very not surprisingly self-directed
like we'll give you this option then this
you can do it and make it happen
but you know when we did ours with with with with not a con we said well we
really want you know we really want this kind of plot
we need a room that does this we we came in a whole bunch of things and they
were very nice about it and gave us a whole bunch of things
and i think the only thing we shifted from like the second to the third was
we had always done it at midnight and that was killing people so we made it
ten although it ended up being obviously later
well we tried to make it eight and ended up being ten or whatever you know
in other words we shifted it forward we just said okay we're going to
shift it forward that seems to work better
but in doing so you kill off your primary
your primary time slot at your cons
and not all cons are comfortable with that and i don't know what hope is
i mean i would love it if they were i would love it if death come did
you know it's like great do a demo party
get a prize and get everything great i think go to great
do you think do you think block party um we'll stick canonical
do you think perhaps should block party reach its 10th year
that uh it will be moved to other parties
well fronky is always stated and this isn't anything back
back channel or anything fronky is always stated that it's not it if if block
party were to move yeah not a con would continue to have a demo party
like he just sees it as a thing that would be great
yeah that a bad that that that's the way it should be so
that's cool you know you know so think of it as like
an inevitable part of the genesis that might occur
but you know there's no um there's no reason
if block party quote unquote got huge enough
that it wouldn't be its own event i just don't see where that's going to
happen personally under my tutelage i just don't
see that happening i couldn't be wrong i mean i'm saying moving uh to
other uh like block party part of hope block party
what do you mean um we
i think it just comes down to uh like if somebody came to me and said we'd like
to run with hope yeah and i would go
and would you like to help us and i would go yeah i hope yeah
um but i'm not gonna put a large amount of money into it
i'm not going to spend that money because that's just more money than i
can possibly spare but if you know it was kind of the same thing with
the retro room that i ran at death con this year
we're basically i didn't pay any money
all i did was help broker all the people and i said you're good you know
you've got this huge vacs you've got this con that has a room
let's put you two together let's make sure that the con
gives the guy with the back's money for his moving
cost and is truck and and everything else
and let's make that happen and then we'll put it all together and
promote it and it'll be great and i'll be here as a person you can
yell at if there's a problem of which of course there were like five
that we had to fix i don't mind that role i kind of enjoy that role i don't
mind the ups and downs of that role so something like that
happening at hope or something that helps me i'd be
more than happy to be part of it um i just wonder you know
you know hope tends to be like we've given you
300 square feet to do your thing enjoy
your Monday um and that may or may not work with whoever's organizing it
doing things to go what don't i need this and this and i could really use
some money and i could be like we don't have any money for that
uh you know a big thing is sometimes having some level of prizes well what
if there's no prizes yeah is that good that bad so yeah okay
yeah you get to you get to rent your your equipment so you get to
well borrow the equipment from not a con and the nullies other things
right or whatever man it's like you know i i i love demo parties uh more
the better i just don't like it when somebody acts like they're a demo party
and they're not or if somebody is uh trying to to uh come off
being a demo party for the purposes of promotion
and then they're not actually a demo party so you know that that's my
problem what i mean you're gonna have that problem with anything
right you're gonna have that problem where anybody does some sort of endeavor
like like this is a side thing um i see yeah is a part of the community
that creates those rockets that shoot pumpkins wait i see is yeah i see
big in it huge in that shit like behind i forgot which one
i think it's called i think he's i think he's behind the one that's called
force amendment yeah but there's um you know that's one of the things he does
right yeah and he has fun with it and he goes to it and he's involved in this
community and they do their stuff and they have their big event and it's got
some rules you know you can't use certain kinds of explosives and you got
a pumpkin can't break apart and you know they do their thing
you know and he doesn't sit around telling people what they can do and what
they shouldn't do and go well i've run this event over here therefore you know
i mean it's like he's to me like nobody else is like kind of fighting the
pumpkin nobody's like trying to make the better version or
using it as a way to make some extra money by claiming oh we do
pumpkin flinging things too well sponsored by this you know so
demo party wise um i think the country could sustain
probably a half dozen before things start to get kind of stupid
in america we really really big on this maker thing
and i think that's our demo party and we're bigger on the big on this maker thing
what do you yeah we're really big on like that whole like
smash and shit apart and making it and yeah
market that you know it's kind of what what we're trying to kind of aim a lot
of people at and we have a couple superstars
we got a lot of people who are noodling right we got a lot of people who are like
i just added an LED in my radio like okay you go to town
and you got like Jerry turning the person to an intendo
which is a flashy thing not overly complicated but a flashy
need example of doing something simple and producing it really well
yeah and then you have people who are like building
custom fun boxes and building modifications
so that they can broadcast stuff or or or you know
putting out you know VGA signal to create something that initiates
its current status and stuff you know that people are like really taking it to
some crazy level there there's a whole range of it
and it just seems like that caught the spark and the fire
that demo parties has in other country yeah i see where you're saying hi
like we're almost positive that we're going to have an Arduino
category next year
because it's so dominant here so or con you know you you got to go with things
are and it's like people want
Arduino's and so i'm like maybe we'll do an Arduino category fine
you know a lot of European parties have spectrum categories for instance
there are no spectrums in the states and they're there are some but there's not
nearly as many as there are in europe right but there are so many adrenos
here and so many people playing with those like uh
yeah they have spectrums we have adrenos kind of weird but
i just sort of um i'm uh yeah i i can see that sort of uh
separation of mentality or not mentality of uh culture that you're
getting it yeah and i think that there's some level where you're like i
really wish they did that here i'm going to do things
ludicrously so that um you know i'm going to do things ludicrously
even though at great loss you know uh
to make something that shouldn't be happen
or you can say well no you're in america this is what they do
this is how it works and we got to suck it up um
you know yeah yeah yeah i spend a lot of time
right in the real instead of the i wish
you spend a lot of time in the real a lot of but there's so many people like you're
like you know there ought to be a demo party that's going to be this
and i'm like great do it you know a lot of people don't you know
as a certain kind of person organizes these things
well hopefully more people will get to organizing
they won't party i mean you know this is common pitfall
uh one is making way to any big promises
yeah now one of them is like um failing to account for things being a
certain way or acting a certain way you know people not
really uh what's the word thinking out a uh
um you know what could not work or what might work
do you think um um these sort of i'm wondering how many
hacker parties there are in europe and these things because in the states it
seems like we have quite a few and i'm wondering
if hacker parties are sort of a little bit more popular here
whereas demo parties are more popular there
yeah it gets here's the thing it gets
it gets relatively complicated because a lot of what we call hacker
parties yeah or hacker events are actually security events
yeah so with a very heavy security industry
bent which is totally incompatible with everything ever in terms of
demo and hacking and so on and so that happens a lot like
you know like there's a real you know i mean the
security is like kind of like the way of the day so
there's a lot of those kind of conferences in europe
see see uh hits b uh there's one in Asia whose name i'm forgetting
um there's um you know there's a lot actually
if you are willing to accept certain aspects of them
that some people might say no no no it's not real because
they don't do a bnc and that's well that's only time it's a real hacker part
a lot of people just walk around it would i consider to be totally hacker
parties who um we'll say no no no this is just
some corporate piece of crap
there's not much i can do about that you know i'd like good so
the problem is when can you pass a certain number of people at a party
yeah you start running into insurance issues
and organizational issues and so if you have a hacker party that's like
20 people you have it at the bar because there's one i go to that like that
they don't have to worry about insurance they just find the bar out for the
afternoon but if you have an event where it's like
we're gonna have a hotel break we're gonna have rooms we have to buy the rooms
the room is three or four thousand dollars and they want an
advance so we have to ask people for money uh i know freaks nick the hacker
what they do is they do all sorts of networking and computer work for this
hotel and then return the hotel what's them have the room for free
okay they you know they'd barter it but there aren't many like that
do you think uh do you think naticon is uh in any way unique uh
in any sense when compared to other hacker parties
you don't mind me asking well the thing i like about naticon is that they're
extremely self-study yeah they don't really depend heavily on others
and say well you know we make this happen um in terms of like
we need to have x amount of sponsors paying for every single piece of it and we're
gonna add this in and that and as we look you know like they'll have sponsors
but it's not their driving forces how many sponsors can we pack
in every single thing and i think that comes off on a lot of it of like
it's a it's an event put together for the sake of it
of its people and i don't know how well i'm expressing all this but that's not
always the push of a lot of hacking conventions a lot of hacking conventions
are like well there's some more sort of organization or company that's put
together an event for people to show up to and naticon is just for itself
yeah and i think that that's relatively rare now
and so there's not a security event there's not a like let's have this event with
um like there's not a sales floor at that naticon it's not only a vendor
area there's a couple people who sell things but there's not like a room of
people selling things simply to sell things to that group of people
yeah tend to be people who are at the event
selling stuff of theirs when they're not contributing a talk
it's a much more honest i don't know maybe it's a bit not the best word but
honesty the more of a watch word with naticon the most which is why of course i've
enjoyed working with them because i know i'm in there
they're like let's do block party because block party sounds like a
cool thing to do not oh boy let's
figure out how we can make more money from something like block party
yeah so we're gonna have block party and we're gonna have
um this other event because that other event even though it's not always
compatible with us we'll bring in this amount of money
you know that's not always kind of where they roll
what are any sense at all what are what are uh you are holding this for five
years of course uh what are some of the other goals with block party have you
thought about uh some of long-term goals with block party
no there's not really any long-term goals like that
it's more like man they really wish there were american demo parties
and um now i'm gonna be like well that's what five of them feels like
um and either people go wow you know that was awesome let's do more
more people go that was fun what's on tv and you know that that'll be what it is i
i'm not really aiming for one thing to win over another or you know what's
turned us into this or i'm hoping that we'll find out arenas or anything like
that's not really anything kind of i make i'm excited for
for an in our in val to be honest with you and seeing how these things go
so um yeah it sounds like uh it sounds like they had a lot of fun
here as well and um maybe cleaveland was too far for them or something like that
like not exactly sure what their mentalities are yet because i'm interviewing you
first yeah right so cleaveland is a tough sell it will always be a tough sell
it is a tough city to convince people to go to just like it's a tough thing to convince people
to go to st. Louis or to go to a non coastal city that hasn't dove itself up
as some sort of turic mecca um you know i think nothing um
demonstrates cleaveland's primary issue with them the fact that they have a rock and roll hall
of fame and the induction ceremony for the rock and roll hall of fame is held in
New York City so you know if they can't even get people to come out for that
big event and they have to hold it elsewhere in another city that really kind of a test
what we're dealing with there and i think there's really an i don't really have
a solution um their taxes are relatively
vaguely crippling um you know they haven't discovered what their next big
industry is you know like they're not like we're going to like drop taxes for every new biotech
like like basically Cambridge Massachusetts did that they were like oh you're in biotech oh you
don't pay much back here get a bateman's on your property and so as a result it became a biotech
center of the world because somebody there said we want to be this nobody's only done that yet
with really with cleaveland yet we see um that's all you know well i i plan quite frankly on
exploiting the fact that um that the discs were invented in Minneapolis that's what's going to
that's going to be my motto for this huge party coming to the Minneapolis
we did happen in the valley too because it's the problem is it gets cold yeah yeah that's so that's
when it's what what months you can have it and also it's not a hub for any airlines so it's a
double hop for everybody yeah that's this it's funny how much the airlines kind of affect things
um so you end up saying oh i'm going to have to fly two legs to get to your city at top i mean
i've been to Minneapolis once hope to be there again um well let me know if you come again
so i can say hi at least but uh yeah i don't know next time i'll be there but one of you know
that that's the same problem my and um you know it's it's unfortunately for people who are listening
i don't know how much this is just them but i mean it's just the case of conference organizing
is a dreary and sometimes terrifying business with a lot of back channel work and political issues
and concerns and and go between you know this stuff that just happened and it's just a fact of
life and it doesn't go in that way if it's a hacking convention a demo party uh science fiction
convention a big quilt convention you know it's all gonna have this kind of power of organizing
behind it there's just no way around it and it's just one of those things and people show up and
they're just like oh this was all put together for me and it was easiest pie and so i am on
to have a fun time and you know and they don't realize this you know sometimes people put
themselves in nature financial risk for these events and we'll know by sunday or saturday morning
how fat they are in terms of finances you know it's it's it's pretty pretty gruesome business
i'm just really thankful that not a con takes a lot of that off of my hands
let me tell you i mean i wish you good luck to anyone who thinks they want to do it because
there are some pitfalls but if it's successful you feel great yeah it sounds like you just have to
do it to be honest if you it sounds like the complexities that uh organizing these things um
and the hardship of organizing these things is just it's going to be the same uh no matter what
you just should do it and see what happens yeah exactly so um i'm going to close this this interview
is there anything that uh you think we should discuss before now i think we we've destroyed
everyone's faith in how long a podcast can be i know i'm i'm shooting for six hours next time
that's yeah yeah that would all right uh so um we will be right back
uh take care Jason all right all right
oh
you
I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't

I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I
don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don
I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm about, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going
Um, who is the author of that, uh, of that demo was shown a block party, uh, 20109, and, uh, how's it going in and R?
It's, uh, it's going quite well, and you made the same mistake as me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay. Um, call them in and R all the time, in RR.
Yes. Um, it's just another Saturday.
As I understand, uh, Sully Lowell was, uh, actually party-coded.
It's highly party-coded, um, the whole thing is, I, I had sent my laptop, my laptop off for repairs a week before.
Yeah.
That's why I came to the party to pass the wing, nothing.
No, no hardware, no software, nothing.
Were you planning on doing anything, or is this something?
Yes, I had actually landed on it on the meeting of our production.
So, so, I, I was kind of the shot when it came to, to the event, without anything at hand.
Um, so, uh, with Coda, I wasn't clean off because, uh, you know, I actually landed at the same time.
So, uh, on the train right up from the airport, you know, or just kind of lamenting about it.
Uh, I was, being whiny and kind of, like, I was crying about it.
Uh, so, so we took the, uh, the demo lounge.
And, one of the things that Jason Scott says is, hey, we have laptops for rent tech because they felt sorry for us.
Yeah.
And, right, right at that moment, my eyes lit up.
I was, I was, I was, I was seriously like, oh, cool.
I have something I can use for writing a production.
Yeah.
I had joked with Coda and a couple of other people before just, you know, uh, off the cost saying, hey,
I might actually write a production for myself.
Well, I had originally needed to write something using OpenGL and STL and stuff like that to do it on PC.
But, since I didn't have anything like that handy and I didn't have my framework and stuff to make, but together for it,
I didn't really feel like sitting down and trying to rewrite all that stuff by hand.
I just didn't know where to do.
I saw you talking.
Yeah.
Uh, so I did.
And that would be, that would be, the end result of it.
Well, it's, it's pretty nice.
It sounds nice.
I, I like it.
As I understand, uh, Virg did the soundtrack on this?
Yep.
Virg did the soundtrack of it.
Um, I, that was also kind of, uh, uh, an auditory as well.
And I was actually thinking of having COTA do it.
Yeah.
But we figured out that there was a, a sort of, uh,
I don't remember exactly what it was, but, um,
Hey, so the quality with how that, with how the combos are,
it's not permitted to do that.
So, um, I asked Virg, he was like,
I asked, uh, it originally came up because I took him out to, uh,
just every content street in the hotel.
Yeah.
If he was just like, hey, man, I'm kind of Jones personally,
and everyone else has gone out to charity.
So, uh, you know, you want to go out and say goodbye, like, that's cool.
So, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
okay, I think the moral of this, this story so far is,
if you take Virg out to eat, he'll make music for you.
No.
So, I'm, I'm highly on it.
Uh, so, so, the whole thing is,
uh, so, he and I live in Illinois.
Yeah.
Okay, he just recently moved, uh,
I think the, the me before it's been used to,
it was springtime, springtime before,
uh, this, this last, last, last, last party.
Um, you know, you actually got into,
to experience Jimmy Johnson, experience, you know,
what it was like, and I was like, hey,
this all went down the street when I was walking from the train station.
So, let's just, let's go ahead and go there,
and see if I can eat.
Um, and to keep him out when I sat myself on down the train,
it was a bit flat.
Uh, kind of a demo scene,
that Lee, that coat of head put together,
using midi.
Yeah.
Um, so he covered, uh, like,
the second reality soundtrack,
the stigma from phenomena.
Uh, shoes are flying,
the shaders are spying,
little bitchered.
So, he, he covered,
he covered these three songs.
And the midi, that was,
about two minutes of the,
fifty seconds long,
on the streets of law.
Yeah.
And there was,
one prominent orchestra head.
And thus, the,
the group was born, I suppose, huh?
Yes.
That's what,
it's just his children.
Right?
So,
so he could hold him down on it.
That was, that was his big thing,
like, he, he really, really,
really easy to do on that,
on that orchestra head.
Yeah.
He started laughing.
Like, it was,
it was just hilarious to him that,
a phone like line would have,
a general midi set,
with such a nice,
a set of patches,
good at that.
He said it almost like
he was on an actual,
no synthesizer.
But the orchestra head
was something special to him,
because it was just,
it stood out more.
So, so he was like,
okay,
I will go ahead and end right,
something like crack,
crack,
and then,
I will just finish
4k demo,
you see that,
you think that sort of,
that sort of,
uh,
uh,
as it were.
So,
so, I mean, that's,
that's where history kind of
began with that.
And then, um,
I was just getting so frustrated
with, was writing it at the,
at the,
already writing the actual,
the actual demo,
because,
job on a cell phone,
like, line,
is stupidly restrictive,
yeah.
To the point where,
I was actually asking friends
of mine who were experienced
at it,
to see if I could like,
their sway,
the duty,
and to get me more eager.
All of them laughed.
They, they, they,
they completely,
utterly just,
laughed in my face,
and told me,
no, are you nuts?
Yeah.
Really, really,
you think so?
Um,
and it was,
this, this really good,
uh,
that, because,
I had all these,
these demo effects,
written,
that had never actually
made it into the final
production,
because,
they all paused
into crashing.
Um,
to see the end,
which has just been out,
all sorts of interesting,
e-heirs,
just,
just,
reading from,
don't want your exceptions,
because of,
you know, lack of heat,
through,
uh,
out of memory exceptions,
because,
you know,
lack of heat,
out of memory exceptions,
and everything else
in between,
so,
I started getting really,
really,
really,
this,
this hard diet,
um,
is I,
as I understand,
you are,
either in the process of,
or have you released,
a, uh,
final version of this?
I've been in the process
of,
um,
well,
okay.
Um,
so, the whole,
the whole thing is,
uh,
I didn't have,
uh,
So I'm just going to go ahead and rewrite a lot of the really, really critical parts in
Jasmine and try to make it actually run with something.
You had mentioned that maybe stepping back a little bit.
You had mentioned that you had open GL, STL sort of framework that you were planning
on.
You're releasing a PC demo.
Do you plan on doing anything PC-wise for 2010 or your party?
I'm going to hope so, like, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I don't have the same
sort of, if you see happen with my hardware, I can.
Yeah.
Yeah, you've been doing like cash flow and how much I'm dumping it through a sort of
at the moment.
I don't think I'm really changing that pops anytime soon.
So I'm going to keep my fingers crossed and like, hoping for you that I don't have to
send my laptop in for repairs again because that would just, that would make a lot of parties
such a, such a, a, a bad look of that.
But no, going back to the whole distance part of it, though, and it hurts soundtrack.
Yeah.
I was getting so frustrated with actually writing the productions that it was getting, it was
getting out of my mind, but you just give up on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of people have that thought.
It's like, okay, okay, no, no, no.
Okay.
If I may interrupt here, it's, you have like, yeah, it's like one person or one group going,
we gave up.
We, we, it just, no, it's not happening.
And then everyone's like, oh, boo, boo, you gave up.
No, you got to keep on going.
And then maybe the next day, they're like, we gave up.
Yeah.
It happens a lot.
Well, it actually was, it was anyone thought in the back of my mind, but what really stitched
it was the fact that Bert delivered the soundtrack.
That really, really, really sold the deal for me.
And, and after that, it was just, it was a matter of just either admitting defeat and then
being kind of looked down upon by everybody or actually like going through with production
and getting it submitted and actually presenting it.
Yeah.
And, and obviously, I went with the latter on this one.
It was just, it was an over here.
I was going to go ahead and actually submit my production as, as, as proud as it was.
Um, I, it sounds, I'm also creating it as, it is a kind of production.
Um, that's okay.
Like.
But, I mean, it's, yeah, I, it got down to it where I was down to the, down to the wire.
Yeah.
And I had, I had to do something.
So I just kind of said, hey, I will clean up what I have and I will just show it.
But, the crowd liked it.
They got shown and they never went there.
I was saying to, you got a big, uh, round of applause and wasn't so bad, right?
But what really got me, though, is the fact that they cheered for a starfield on a self-owness flag.
How did I get to you?
Well, it was, it's a fresh for me.
I've never actually had anybody cheered for anything that I've done like that before.
Like, it's, I've always usually just done, like, boring and bad talks and stuff like that.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have, I have stuff to say about that later, but no, it was, it was kind of cool to have everyone cheering with the starfield on screen.
Like, that actually, that was just, that made my night.
Like, I live in the starfields under way too long, but...
Yeah, I'll have criticisms for it.
I think we all have criticisms for our productions.
Yeah.
Right, so.
Yeah.
It was good.
But that was, that was, that was a good first production.
That was actually my very first demo ever.
Yeah.
Uh, because I understand it was your first party ever as well.
Yeah.
Now, uh, you have decided to host your own party.
Oh, man.
And this is actually kind of grew out of, out of the offensive launch line at Macfest, right?
Yeah.
So, in front of mine told me one winter that he was going to drag me kicking and screaming to Macfest.
So, he did just that.
He dragged me kicking and screaming to Washington DC.
Yeah.
And the moment I know that it was going to be my experience.
I, it was, it was awesome.
I'm just going to leave it at that.
I can't, I can't offer it at the worst.
I see.
Um, the, the, it was not what I was expecting it to be.
So, they, they told me that it was a, like, a video game sort of, like, convention thing.
And I was, I instantly had the bad connotations in the back of my mind, just kind of, like, showing up.
Yeah.
I may, you know, I've never been to Macfest and I may have some biases against it just for the fact that, like, that's how it was presented to me, too.
Like, uh, or just reading about it, rather, this is a video game sort of confidence.
But it's, it's really, it's...
But Modtrine is there, right?
So...
Modtrine is there.
So, you do have a big habit, like, Tiger contingent.
Yeah.
The thing that really seals Macfest, though, is the fact that it's more about music.
Oh.
So, you guys actually take the video game soundtracks.
They will actually, like, do live covers of them and just do really, really insane stuff with them.
Yeah.
I mean, it's all very creative and it's all very...
It's very much the same thing on...
And...
To make, to make that as worse.
Uh, the event organizers at one point, uh, I think, for Macfest for...
Macfest Aid is coming up this January.
So, let's...
Let's respect this right away.
Um...
So, Macfest Sport was the pilot event for...
He sort of this small demo show.
Hmm.
Okay.
So, he actually had...
He actually tried to have competitions where it's set up there.
Um...
And it flopped.
I mean, they were frustrated with the turn out of it and it just flopped.
Yeah.
Um...
So, I was talking about it.
And I mean, the primary goal wasn't really a demo scene stuff.
I mean, it is, but it's not really more demos.
It's more fun music instead.
Yeah.
With a reluctant demo combo, because GarGuy kind of, like, twisted my hand and said,
no, you're going to have a demo combo.
Uh...
He has to be quiet and have a demo combo and I was just like, uh,
because none of the people really there are demo covers.
I don't know if I'm some sort of mailing list or something like that, but I remember this...
Parts of this conversation somehow.
Or maybe this is in my head, like, I don't know, like, uh...
I remember GarGuy pushing for a demo competition.
I wonder what this was.
Um...
That was probably on some sort of a live journal or something.
Yeah.
Actually, I think it wasn't live journal.
Um...
But, uh...
But no, he twisted my arm and said, no, you're going to have a demo combo.
You're going to have remote submissions.
Yeah.
Um...
So...
I kind of had to say...
Yes.
I will have a demo combo.
Please let go of my arm.
Well, um...
DR, are you going to...
Are there someone producing an invite for this?
I had...
I had every intention of getting one together.
Yeah.
But everything has just been falling apart.
Nesby's...
Nesby has been trying to approach you.
I don't know if you know this or not.
He has been in...
I...
Like...
I guess I need to poke him again,
but it's been several weeks.
Um...
I can tell him right away.
I'll call him after this.
And if...
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's right.
He lives nearby you, doesn't he?
No, it was California.
Oh, okay.
No, I was completely...
Okay.
Nevermind.
Uh...
Yeah.
No, no, no.
I need to poke him and tell him, hey, uh...
Like...
Invite stuff is not coming together.
Uh...
Do it as you wish.
Yeah.
All right.
Cool.
I'll tell him that.
Like, I'll give him...
I'll give him party information and stuff,
if he can't readily get through it.
Um...
Oh, yeah.
That's you.
Uh...
I've been working on a party website as well.
Yeah.
That was supposed to go up a couple days ago.
But...
Uh...
A plan that mine had some really, really, really pressing issues
that needed to be taken care of.
So I had to drop everything and work on that for a while.
Yeah.
Uh...
How it goes, right?
Yeah.
It's...
I look at the party website up here pretty soon.
Like, real soon now.
Hahaha.
Um...
It's...
It's going to get up this week.
Um...
And I understand you have a...
A wiki...
Uh...
For...
For this party?
Uh...
Yeah, wiki page.
Your personal website.
Um...
This...
This address is actually kind of awkward to...
To tell people because it's...
It's a sign to the classification for roads, right?
And the backpies.
And people don't usually get it right away.
Yeah.
Um...
So...
It depends on really how you're moving it to...
To give you a URL.
I guess I'll just spell it.
Okay.
It's that.
But even then, it's the zero approach.
Okay, so...
I understand that was seen by the US.
Uh...
This...
Uh...
Some information about this party?
Yes.
The US does have information about...
Uh...
No hope.
But, uh...
It's somebody...
I forget, I forget who it was...
But the posting up on the front page.
Yeah.
And then...
If you...
If you look back through...
Uh...
Some of the...
The history...
The new history for going up that...
You can find it there as well.
Or on the coronavirus.
A lot of people actually learn about it through the coronavirus.
Which was actually really bizarre for me.
Because that's...
That's a big...
That's a big fight for domestic conditions.
Yeah.
Um...
domestic conditions and...
Graphic coders and...
Even if...
It's...
It's their square figure.
So it was...
It was kind of bizarre to have it show up there.
Like...
It's an already good way.
Do you know...
Do you know who is responsible for that?
Or is...
Oh!
I don't...
I don't know if you had it.
I'm not on the computer right now.
So...
So I really can't say anything.
I just thought about that.
Um...
Whoever it was, I do appreciate their...
Their enthusiasm and getting the word out.
That was actually kind of cool.
Okay.
So this is...
This is a part of MakeFest 8.
Um...
This is happening in January?
New Year's Day.
New Year's Day.
And...
New Year's Day.
New Year's Day.
New Year's Day to the fourth.
So where is this being held exactly?
MakeFest.
Now in January of Virginia.
On DC Metro.
So if you...
If you fly into Ronald Reagan International Airport and take...
I think the yellow line...
How it's...
Like...
Change Street Station.
You're right at the hotel all of us.
So it's right there.
Uh...
Quotal will be there.
I'm pretty sure.
Quotal is going to be there.
If you...
If you know anybody from lunch trying...
You're...
You're certainly going to know people.
Yeah.
And the bird...
The bird's a celebrity there.
Yeah.
But then again, bird's a celebrity everywhere.
Wow.
Uh...
That's why you have to show up to the places, right?
So...
Is Mad Brain going to be there, do you know?
No.
Uh...
Unless...
Mad Brain cannot...
Cannot come down from Quebec to...
As much...
As much as you would love to.
Um...
I think you actually got university stuff going on at that time.
Hmm, I see.
No.
I think so.
But I'm not sure.
No.
You said you accept remote entries.
Or is this just for the demo competition?
Or is this for all the competitions?
This is for everything accessible or...
Um...
The fast music competition?
Yeah.
Well.
Uh...
We're...
We're kind of locking the room for that.
Like...
Really?
Not really.
Uh...
That's so less exciting.
I can't...
Well, it would be exciting.
But...
We have the lanterns giving kind of irony with us.
Um...
So, yeah.
This is actually a true, sort of, assembly-like style.
I'm already almost...
Except...
And all the foods.
Well, that's a lie.
But...
Just...
For the sake of...
I'm saying...
It's just...
Like, assembly without foods.
Um...
But, uh...
No, we've got lanterns and stuff in the same room.
So, I mean, if we locked the doors...
They would be kind of irony with us.
Uh...
Okay.
So, I was just going to mention the competitions.
You have a demo competition.
Um...
You have a fast music competition.
What are their compos?
Are you, uh...
Are you doing?
We're looking at...
Uh...
Also a streamed music.
So, MP3.
Orpus.
Black.
Alac.
The whole gamut.
You...
You have a player for it that we can use.
Fine.
It's streaming.
Fine.
We'll play it.
Um...
And then we have the old school tracked competition.
So, anything that's...
Like NSF for...
For a Super Nintendo or...
Or...
Nintendo Entertainment.
Or SPC for Super Nintendo.
Or...
Uh...
The VGM stuff for the Sega Genesis.
Big club.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um...
Uh...
Or...
Or spin champions.
Um...
Trying to...
I sent an email back to no carrier.
He has an NGSC-D64.
Yeah.
But he...
Like...
Offered to...
Takeover.
He took the product last year.
Um...
But he offered...
No one has to use it for a short time.
And, uh...
As far as probably more logistical issues are concerned, uh...
How much is the entry fee for...
For this party?
Entry is...
The MagFest registration fee, which should be 45 months to the work.
Uh...
It should be 48 free registration.
But don't grow up feeling that.
Uh...
It's...
It's about as cheap as...
Some of the cheaper European parties.
So if you can afford to go there, you can afford to go here.
Uh...
The only thing that can be killing you...
Is the accommodations.
Uh...
That's ninety-nine a night.
Yeah.
Uh...
That's...
That's something I know to be fact.
So if you can at all, like...
Ask somebody very nicely if you can crash on their floor.
Yeah.
That's what a lot of people do.
Well, I mean...
And that's actually encouraged by the organizers of the event.
They're like, hey, um...
We don't like having to ask the hotel for more hotel rooms.
Um...
So if you don't mind crashing on the floor, like...
Feel free.
Yeah.
Um...
Just ask very nicely.
No, I wonder...
We have a lot of the uh...
North American parties have been in hotels.
So, traditionally, a lot of the hacker parties as well.
And...
I'm wondering, uh...
Will we have a sleeping hall somewhere?
I mean, I know Nade, for instance, was in a...
Uh...
Jason Scott was just mentioning that...
Nade, uh, was in a school.
And for ten bucks, he could sleep on the floor.
In the school.
Hey, yeah, no dice.
Um...
The hotel would really, really, really fall upon that, um...
But...
I mean, if you notice me nearby, I mean, that's...
Yeah.
It's just the same as coming to a convention for a day.
And...
I'm saying, in general, for perhaps other parties, is...
I imagine, yeah, it would probably be difficult to strike a deal with the hotel.
Just thinking on the floor.
Well, ideally, ideally what should happen is...
All right, I would get this...
I would get this event kind of kickstarted, right?
Yeah.
And then pass the buck off through...
The guys who actually run mags ass...
And say, hey, like...
You have to start it.
Um...
You have something with it.
Hmm.
Okay.
All right, so this is...
This is not really something for me to...
To acquire fame, this is actually something for me to...
To try to get something that I'd like...
And to catch something I'd like to go through.
Well, they...
They tried one, it...
They confessed for, you say it.
Right.
Um, so...
So here's...
So here's the breakdown of it, right?
They...
They tried.
Um...
But they didn't do it...
In the right way, apparently,
it's locked.
Something happens.
That's good and evident.
Yeah.
Come on.
You're not sure what they did...
They did it wrong.
And apparently, I've...
managed to get some traction in the community.
Um...
To the point where people actually...
People are actually enthusiastic in...
Like, helping out and...
Uh...
Assisting wasn't to do that.
I have that stuff in the works.
People who are asking me questions about...
I think...
Helping you organize it.
You'll see the emails later.
Um...
But, um...
Although, they try...
They try to make this work.
Um...
And they fail.
And I'm like, well, okay.
Let's...
Let's give it another shot.
We have first blessing now.
Um...
Hopefully I can...
Like start off a good trend...
With one year, and then, like, maybe try to get the ends off...
Next year.
I really like to do that. I like to rent out a university gymnasium somewhere. Maybe like a gymnasium at Washington University in St. Louis, for example.
I just kind of like have the party there. And we've got showers. We've got a big gymnasium board.
Yeah. The fact that you don't have to pay for a hotel room, just maybe getting back a little bit. This has just been in complaint for me. I hope that would draw a lot more people.
Do you think that would affect people's showing at a demo party?
Definitely. In fact, a couple of the other subcultures that I'm part of, most of the complaints usually do involve a hotel.
It's either too expensive or too expensive in an area. I mean, it's best to be complete too. So if you go to the restaurant, turn on the hotel. They're usually a lot more expensive.
Oh, that's their industry, right? So.
So all of the whole thing is, all right, you bring it to a university. Who goes to the university?
Or college students who have barely any money, barely have two nipples broke together. So a lot of places nearby are going to be very cheap.
I mean, that's definitely something to consider, right? Yeah.
There's a telecomination. You've got the places nearby to be. But I mean, how do hotels usually require exclusively agreements with events?
This was an evident cat, the window for walk party, where they kind of forbade us from bringing in outside here.
Yeah. So yeah, that's definitely something to consider as well. Yes, it would help.
Do you have any sponsors for you seeking any sponsorship or?
None. No, okay.
None entirely non-commercial. If somebody wants to give us money?
Doesn't necessarily have to be money, just like soda, for instance.
Yeah, I mean, if they want to give us something like that, we'll do it not to get the word out.
But I mean, we're not going to sit down and roll over to get corporate word out.
I mean, that's one of the things that I'm kind of adverse to, because everyone knows already about AMD and Nvidia and Intel and all the other computer marketing factors.
And I don't really see the need to bring them in so much. If it's the neat new product idea, like cooking.
That I can actually kind of go with.
If it's right to do it, it can be.
So, I mean, it really kind of depends, right?
I say, I say, it's fairly non-commercial. It's like a little bit on that, maybe.
So it's not really like black and white.
No, I'm not seeking sponsorship right now.
It's just me putting me in my lap that's, hey, this can't be, it's new trash handed out to people.
We'll give you money.
Yeah.
I'm not going to say no.
When did you rethinking of thinking of hosting a party before black party?
Or is this something that occurred to you during black party or have you been thinking about this for a while?
No, this party actually came out just out of the attendance of Montrion at Macfast.
How did you, how did you get into Montrion in these people?
I blame Coda for a lot of things.
I blame Coda for a lot of things too.
I blame Coda.
Coda is the reason you're at stocks right now.
Well, Coda and Coda as well, I think, these two things combined.
But, I'm sorry.
Okay, okay, all right, all right. So, what were you to say?
All right, so.
Coda, we love you.
Okay, no.
You can laugh at it anyway.
So, sliding out a channel on another network called the Open Canvas sessions, OCS.
Yeah.
A friend of mine from the West Chicago suburbs is the annual channel founder and I just kind of hang out there.
It's become quite the noticing channel for some reason.
Because we've got a German guy from Karlsruhe who hangs out there now.
And, I mean, he was actually, he came from fortune and so it kind of came full circle.
It was kind of funny how that happened.
And, Coda mentioned it's not trying.
So, I go in there and I'm told they're talking about music.
And, they're actually blanking.
They're talking about chord progression.
And, what happens is you flat a certain degree of a note or a certain degree of a chord.
So, I mean, what happens if you say some random chord and you flat the fifth degree?
And, these guys are talking about hardcore due to composition stuff.
And, I'm just like, oh, hey, it's cool.
Uh, nationally Coda's in there.
But then, you've got some of us in the math brain and a couple of others' celebrities in there.
And, they're all talking about their own little things.
I mean, the math brain has this thing with that sense of this.
Like, he's a master at it.
I mean, you won't be able to do that.
Really?
Yes, he's an F.M. since God.
Hi.
That's a talk to him.
It's a math brain.
Yes, dude, you talked to him.
He has a wealth of information to divulge.
And, he loves to tell you about it.
And, that's not a bad thing either.
Like, I genuinely appreciated that.
I took, he gave me sensual algorithms, right?
For, um, cooking up operators?
Yeah.
And, I took a post-it note and I wrote down all the algorithms he gave me and I stuck them on the wall.
That's how much I appreciated it.
Like, I stared every day.
That's something that I was really, really kind of cool.
Um, and then I came in and I came into that and told him, hey, I kind of know some of the physics and math behind that.
So, I mean, we got that kind of relationship going and then come to think of it.
And math is also a eight linguistics guy, which is kind of right up my alley, too.
So, you know, we've got that much to talk about still.
I mean, all these guys are more than just music, right?
So, I mean, you go in there and you listen to them or be what they're talking about, you know, with regard to music.
But then they'll go on top of the conversation and then they'll start talking about programming and linguistics.
And then, if it's in the session, all these other topics that don't really release tracking so much, that's how I kind of got into it.
Yeah.
So, I'm not, I'm not some extractor myself because I do with programming and math stuff, right?
Yeah.
My creativity really comes through writing the most elegant math proofs.
I'm kind of working in there hard on the brain.
Ah, boring to some people.
Well, yeah, only with some people.
You get some kind of math decisions.
You think they're gods of times.
They say that you're preaching from the book.
As Paul Erdisch used to say when he came up with that, the most elegant person he could think of.
He would actually like hold the paper out and say, this one is from the book, right?
So, I mean, you can people who appreciate it, but I mean it's boring to most because they don't understand it.
Right?
They just don't care.
It's kind of sad, but at the same time, it's understandable.
Either way.
Either way.
Ah, that's kind of how I got into math trying.
I just kind of hang out there and whenever they have a tracker combo, it's kind of a capture.
Rather than I'm going to have the time to sit down and actually try to hack something together.
Okay.
So, everyone, do you mind if I close this interview up?
No, go ahead.
Please.
All right.
So, everyone, you've got to come.
Okay.
So, everyone, you've got to come to...
All right, I've been pronouncing this new repute, but it's actually pronounced nor pub.
Right?
No pub, yep.
Yep.
Yeah.
And mod trying will be there.
A lot of those people.
And all your favorite people that you know from the scene, more or less.
So...
I'm sorry?
You were in the American scene.
Yeah.
Well, we're like family, right?
So...
Morning.
It's me.
We're a festival type group of people, so I suppose we are family.
Oh, man.
What was his name?
There was a...
Oh.
All right.
I came to Block Party on a bus, right?
It was terrible.
It took a long time.
It was a horrible bus ride.
But that aside, there's another person who came his name.
He submitted...
He did a track.
A piece of music that he submitted into the competition for Block Party.
His name begins with L.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Uh...
Uh...
Not Sean.
Your neck is a width.
No.
No, not from my neck of the woods.
I think he was in Michigan or something.
I don't know exactly where he was.
Well, again, that's kind of your neck of the woods.
It's from the north.
Uh...
Uh-huh.
The only person I can think of with an L offhand is Lapine from...
That's him.
Lapine.
Was it him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
He had a hell of a fun time.
He did.
Um...
He started really lamenting about some of the things that went wrong.
I couldn't remember exactly what he was...
What he was planning about.
But, uh...
Like the last time he got from his boss was...
Was there anything weird?
And a number of other things.
He's kind of like...
That meet of the screens.
He got a little bit.
Uh-huh.
And then the competition section came by and...
And he cheered about quite a bit.
Yeah.
And that's over our antics in the hotel room.
Uh...
There are photos.
There are photos of shops.
Of photos.
Uh...
How's stuff that happened in the boss trying to go to the hotel room?
All right.
So...
Um...
It was a good time.
So, I guess, uh...
Thanks for joining us.
Thank you.
All right.
Take care.
