Okay so welcome to my introductory show
Which is about like how I got into tech and I guess Linux
Because that's somewhat a theme of whatever this is
Apparently so that's the thing
I kind of owe you guys a show
Because I've been listening for just a little while and I decided yeah I do the near stream thing
I joined in you know talk a little bit
I'm sure someone listening to this was there and heard me speak
So yeah
And I said I do an introductory show
At least the bare minimum I would do that
And as this website here says on the contribute section
If you talk so you're doing a show they need oh it's a show
So I oh yeah I show and this is that show
So I say so a lot
It I have some notes written down
Um a little little text editor here in them
and
And the first line just says this will suck so that's
It's the confidence I have in me
I'm doing a lot of hand gestures here as if you can hear me or see me sorry. I hope you can hear me
My instinct is I just just just just articulate a lot so you know if I bump the mic by accident
Sorry for your drums
uh suffer
Anyways
Yeah, I am a lot that I already say that I don't know
I have the memory of a disease the goldfish so if I repeat things I'm also sorry
Maroon is gonna get cold so I can't make this so so long
Because I have to turn by you know furnace off
And that's kind of an issue because it is I can check
32 degrees outside so yeah
Not the weather that you want to have your furnace off in
So let's speed this up a little bit
So I don't freeze to death in here
Burrana I I heated up to 70 uh for before hand so I don't
Completely die but it is for like 20 minutes, but I don't think I will I don't have that much to cover
My audio from this mic is of dubious quality. I don't think it'll sound great
But I don't think it'll be awful by any means it's uh
I don't know. It's just like some $40 microphone I got a Amazon
So it can't imagine it's awful, but I can't imagine it's great
I've heard the sound from before so I know it it's all right
It won't you know torture your drums or anything so yeah
Let's actually start the thing I've been rambling for nearly four minutes now
Uh that'll actually be short because I have to cut out the part where I
Like like three and a half minutes I've been rambling too long
What does my show got again? I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm messing with you as a test
Uh this show as I said before is about how I got into tech and eventually you know Linux
But tech tech this is how I got into tech that's more general right
I've always been very technical
Person sorry I got a text should probably turn my phone
Well for this
Yes, she was loud um
Like when I was really young um I was less of like you know dolls and
um
It's what do you call those things action figures this kind of thing so it's not my thing
stunt that kind of child
um
I was more like you know technical stuff like uh
I mean
What I was a child that's not like like I mean like I got into child that's not like I was
Doing anything you know amazing, but stuff that was you know normal kids would not be interested in
Not to say that I was like a child prodigy. I certainly was good at it. It was just you know the thing I like to do
And that was the kind of kid I was
So obviously I was into computers and
Despite the computing technology at the time not being
You know amazing I did some games as well
Uh, like what I have access to I mean I there is
Better than what I had access to but it was not like
Well, we have now obviously and
sometimes
When I was like probably
I don't know
10 maybe my dad my father put linux on a computer
Hands full of sleep
It was an old laptop
I
Can't remember for life in me what kind of laptop I was or I would say because that's
That would that would probably give you a better idea of when this was but I don't know
Nothing fancy. Obviously. It was not a very good computer for the time. It wasn't awful
But nowadays if you were to touch that computer you would probably be very uh disappointed
and
He put linux on it and I I mean I'd run
What I use windows I think probably mostly windows only
There's xp vista the kind of thing remember exactly what
Because I was not that old
Yeah
And I was really interested in it
Uh
Because I it was something new and I always have like new things
That uh, you know, I'd like to get my head around to understand these new things that are
Being put in front of me
so
I did and I didn't understand it too well because I was you know only like 8 to 10
It's not like I
Was written
written some
If I can code that she isn't saying she shouldn't swear
It's bad to know now. I mean it's not against rules or anything. It's just
Want to be accessible to all not that I think young children regularly listen to
This show, but just think he's tried to swear
Or uh cuss if you'd like to see it like that
Not how it said where I'm from
It's different for everyone
And
When I got rid of that computer I just went back to like whatever the hell
Windows probably I don't think it was mac
That's the only two options because it was something mainstream
So for a long time I uh didn't use Linux anymore
But I was still into technology as a whole
So I mean I did technology east stuff
Whatever that means I don't actually know. I just don't need this stuff and I know you know we're a little bit of code
Nothing amazing at all probably like
What would have been
JavaScript
So you obviously nothing
Amazing again, not a prodigy
It's not a very good child anyways
Jeez I should remain it's I keep cute like just like yeah, I'm like oh, I have notes right here why I'm not reading them
Uh, I think like five years now. I wouldn't have been five years ago. I had to be in the last night
Yeah, I had to be like three years ago. What year is it?
2021
2020 18 18 you three or four years ago 2017 2018
And 2017 and the beginning of 2018 somewhere around that area
I got into Linux again um
But I only my father
Blossom uh still
I hope to mean because that I was not very good at that and he was
Even though it was old enough that you know
It certainly should have been doing this by myself with Google like I was way too old to be asking my father to help me
But he helped me do the Linux and Windows
um
And I just kind of think of clinics a little bit
And then once again
No longer had windows because I
Was sorry Linux
Because I can't you know, I'm never if I don't go all the way into something. I'm not gonna do it uh
I can't like just half-ass it. I got it. I got plunged into it. So I learned them. That's how I learned uh
I for you my free window manager, you know that is which
Most of you should I think but maybe a institution that I don't know
That's how I learned this thing. I just you know all the way and take the plunge
Learn what I'm doing and if I don't do that, I'll probably give up on it
Excuse me. I have a dry mouth
So I went back to using windows exclusively windows and now I know it was windows
And I had to like a lot nicer PC now
I don't know the specs
But it was something
I don't know
I would remember if you gave me enough time, but I don't know right now. I
Didn't
Get back into Linux until
the middle of last year
So I'm not exactly
you know
The most veteran Linux user
But I am certainly using it now
Because I don't own any copies of windows anymore and I'm kind of proud of that because I absolutely hate Microsoft nowadays
uh
You know it's just a not a fan of big tech companies at all. That's the same show
So
So I took the deepest plunge in the Linux that could I mean not really I installed pop OS
And it's not really the deepest lunge I could have taken I could have gone like
instilled gen 2 or arch Linux or something just that would have been a deeper punch, but that would have been silly
Probably not the best way to start Linux
I mean not start Linux because obviously it's easy before
But through I did not have that much knowledge and I had actually not been you know doing any
coding stuff programming whatever they'll any of the difference, but I don't know what it is
I feel like one one time is different for that. I don't know why
Uh, I actually stopped doing that. I don't like impure stuff
Doesn't actually matter to leave it off, but I can't rewind it anyway
I feel like I'm going off on too many tangents
um
And I've only gone off on like two, so that's it's probably not true
uh
What would I say? Right
So I hadn't been doing any code at all. I was really at least I think I did where I was younger
Of course nowadays I am
Uh, but that is later on in this show not much later on but a little bit later on
So I got into Papua's uh, pretty simple um
Like just you know
It's basically kind of um
Literally basically is kind of nuts about it. That's all it is. So
I just
Used that and
Also did some more technical stuff underneath it like I was learning, you know
command line
bash obviously because I
What else would I be using that was just getting links and I still use bash as a show
So I was getting into more
technical stuff um
This is really where the story starts to end
I was getting to that kind of thing, you know
technical
Linux more deeper stuff like writing shell scripts
Uh, to do things for me, you know, nothing fancy again
and
That's not amazing, but to me it was like whoa
This is this is crazy. I am doing stuff that I can never do before
I'm gonna have to pee by the end of this
And
I was doing that for a while and I'd say about
August now
October, November this year
I gotta do a lot of talk to that. It's not relevant
Uh, and I installed the Community Edition of Minjaro Packages i3
Which is really a deep punch because I never used i3 before that and uh, it was really nice to them. I liked it
And it's kind of where I am now. It's exactly where I am now. I'm using
Uh, not the exact same, you know
Install that upgrade system, but I am using that same
Package version with the Minjaro Packages i3
It's what I'm using now
Community Edition of Minjaro
And I love it. I mean
I definitely enjoy having the Arch user repository a or
Uh, of course, I don't actually have arch because uh, why would I?
I can just use Minjaro
Arch just seems to complicate things more than I really need to
If someone gives me a value reason to use Arch over Minjaro, I will definitely hear it out, but I don't really have one
so
Yeah
And now I'm kind of learning
Some basic good stuff with like, you know
Again, uh, that's what I'm looking for
Very basic
It's been only like a month of me doing this so no we're near
Amazing at it, but hopefully it'll be a job one day as much as I think that'll be kind of soulless
So one thing I can probably do because I'm not good at anything
Yeah
So
That's almost basically the entire story
Um almost basically
I don't think there's two words of good together like that, but whatever
Ah, I think that is actually the end though
My name, I totally didn't give you a name, did I? I neglected to mention that um
The name I'm choosing to use is O9L
We had a name come from the one I asked you because that's a whole story
Uh
I could I could tell the story eventually
Hmm, I don't go by that name
In a whole lot of places that you won't be able to find me
To maybe I think
That's whatever
Um, of course I have everything on there
You can call me like O9, I guess, I don't really care
You can call me wherever the fuck you want to call me
If you refer to me like, hey dumbass, so I'll probably say what
I
Don't care
That's the end of this oh, I'm leaning on my mouth with my hand
That makes for great audio
That's the end of this
I don't have anything else to close this with, you know, no, no special closing remarks
But yeah, I give you my name there
I guess I have to submit it with my name or something, I'm not quite sure
I don't know how this is gonna work
I've never submitted this show obviously as this is my first
I'm kind of scared I don't know how it's gonna be received but
There's uh, there's a link here in the website
Where is it?
If you are worried the show may not be of interest to hackers and you can click here to check if it is
And it is just a page with the word yes and very high font very large font
So I'm going to assume that no one's going to care
Uh, how bad is I mean
And uh, close that right here
Makes me a little less scared but I am quite nervous to hit some fun on this
Yikes, um, that's in the
Bile
Please don't make fun of me too hard
