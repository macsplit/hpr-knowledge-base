The full circle podcast on hacker public radio in this episode of camp 11 life outside
IRC with Laura Chikofsky.
Welcome to the full circle podcast on hacker public radio.
This is the fifth, if I'm counting correctly, of our highlights of last summer's
unconference, Alka Camp 11, held at final maltings in the south of England.
The full circle podcast is the companion to full circle magazine, the independent magazine
for the Ubuntu community.
Find us at fullcirclemagazine.org forward slash podcast.
This show is a recording of a presentation from Laura Chikofsky on the benefits of real
world as opposed to cyber community.
Entitled life outside of IRC in a floss community, Laura evangelises on the benefits
of real world interaction beyond that online.
Laura describes herself as argumentative, stubborn, a geek, a Ubuntu fan and a monster
fan, a monster for those who don't know, being a major rugby team from the town of
Munster back in her native island.
Laura has this year joined canonical as launch pad support specialist.
So, when I was working with Alka Camp 11, I used to use so many groups that I actually
involved in.
So, as I've already seen, I have to work in the Ubuntu community council, the membership
board.
And I can't speak for any kind of possibility about the Ubuntu, so if I can speak
in advance of this, or imagine the other events that I would, because I want to try
to promote the Ubuntu usership and the Ubuntu community, and for Alka Camp 11, get more
more people involved.
So, people that realize that the Ubuntu engine project exists as a non-proper kind of
showcase organizations that actually use open source, the pitfalls they have, so most
do invoicing, or Alka Camp would do issues, but for most, if they can, they try and save
money by using open source.
It's not good to see these things.
And we've done a blog, and we've done a lot of case studies to business.
So, we'll see if we can hear IRC, yes?
Raise hands?
Yeah.
You don't, IRC.
Do you use forms?
Maintenance?
No, I don't.
Okay, so one of these IRC is basically, for example, you probably can use maintenance or
horns, and they don't really kind of leave the land or work a lot.
It is a bit of an issue, because a lot of people showcase an open knowledge and actually
use IRC, so if you've got a blog, or you've got an issue, they don't have an IRC.
I'm sorry.
I'm a better blogger.
I'm considering you're on.
He's got an issue with his lots of other moments from an upgrade.
My blog will have a lot of the books, yes.
So, what do you do then?
Well, a tweet about this one.
Okay, fair enough.
Did you realize that you're going to have a lot of hard-to-dutch books, and get the books
there to help you tree out?
No, I didn't.
But trying to get people off-hires, you can actually do those face-to-face events like
this.
It's always helped everybody.
So, there's two ways of doing community.
As I said, the virtual web.
Many of this is IRC forms, and I do things these times in the real life way.
So, I'm going to make some of the open-to-UK team where it kind of is possible.
There's also a lot of movies in here.
But again, some of the information is there.
You want to join it.
They're not logged into the open-to-UK team.
I would like to join some free-to-dutch adoption campaign.
There are finally a bunch of books.
We do talk about open-to-dutch books.
We do talk about open-to-dutch books.
We do talk about open-to-dutch books.
There are finally a bunch of books.
We do talk about not being on things other than open-to-dutch books.
It's been actually kind of a social community.
Which, to me, it's due to my language.
Because, again, I'm from Ireland.
It's one of my new Turkish B.K.
I need some people.
It's a bit of reassuring, because you land on the U.K.
You know, two people off of IRC.
And a few of us kind of have been interested in doing other things on an ability.
On one of which is growing.
Big of that.
We organize a bit of a session.
And there's something we're going to talk about.
Because sometimes the events are almost technical.
There's an event or a coding competition.
And it's kind of there.
Well, it's just going to be social to be honest.
So, we decided to just go to a book.
I think it will be an event.
It was a...
It first started.
Right there.
Not to be afraid of it.
And nobody's just a bit of fun.
And I got to meet people up on IRC.
Who I didn't know before.
And I'd speak to the book for the last two years.
And it was nice to put the face.
So, then I think I'm going to interact with people.
So, then we are quite.
We have an Ubuntu UK team.
In Ubuntu, we have not one of the local teams.
There's 142 teams spread out worldwide.
Article 1 of UK is 1.5 has a huge one.
So, when they have an event, like a release party,
5,000 people come through cross-price to that event.
It's quite a lot of people.
And in the States, that's broken up by the States.
I mean, I can't leave it like this.
Maybe 24 people do an event for war.
Which is great.
That's 24 people coming face to face.
And having a chat and getting to their 100.
So, if they have an issue.
I mean, they're too shy or too...
You know, I was like, I actually have a book.
I don't know how to report the book.
And it's nice to meet the person face to face when we watch.
I'll call help you.
I'll talk you through the event.
I'll talk you through it.
I'll have a book.
I'll talk you through it exactly if I'll follow up on that.
So, by meeting people face to face,
you've got a bit of a report.
Because it's more than just pixels on the screen.
So, um, release party is only able to you get.
Okay.
So, we have a local directory.
And it will be on to the local.winter.com.
And you can see all the list of teams worldwide.
Which is...
It's a key engineer project for themselves.
This is all the talent.
Just on my key engineer's.
So, put up the screen.
Capture about the new Winter you can't vote.
And we'll list all our rents.
And the moment there's one event in Manchester,
it will be a development evening in Manchester.
We've now been able to kind of, like, interact
and get people more and more involved.
So, we put up hashtags.
So, people tweak today.
And hash a Winter you can.
It'll show up on here.
And it's load graph zone of Winter UK.
The target with local jams and face face meetups.
Because the target will pick up on here.
So, I'm trying to make these.
The look will try to be more interactive.
So, eventually, along here,
will be a list of people's flaws.
So, the big target logo.
Or a Winter UK logo.
That would be more interactive.
So, we'll see what the members of your team are actually doing.
So, sometimes again, if you're logging about your events,
you won't read your events.
They don't know about it.
But it is all on the centralised places.
I know about the events they can actually contact.
Parts.
So, you can see in some of these things,
there are people who are using the exclamation marks
for more denting up.
In the show as well.
So, they use the dent to go,
the exclamation mark will move to,
it'll show up on this.
So, you'll see if you crit as some from other people.
So, which is,
it's going to bad.
You have to see both aspects of it.
Once you click on the event,
the previous slides are.
And you can click on the Ubuntu one out here.
And sign up and register for events.
And you'll also be able to see a list of people who are attending the event.
It will either give the parts who are organising the events,
a lot of these coming or not coming.
But I also got some encouragement from both of these people.
I think the point.
Okay, I'll have to join.
I have two people going.
I encourage you to sign up and take part in the event.
So, welcome.
We have the Ubuntu versions of the dubb.
And they've spread out to park and dilemma for a possible.
We meet up once a month and go for a park to eat.
It's really, really informal.
There's no talks.
We'll finish work at 6 o'clock and we'll go to the park.
It's just a face that we can actually get to the face today.
It's a party to see.
We know that it's essentialised on the last rights we meet
to month here in Lisbon.
And if you want to join in,
you can just pop in for a park to eat.
Or just ask a question or bring it on.
They can do so.
But it's just really, really informal meeting.
At the moment, when we go to Calder,
he's not really gone on this anymore.
He wants to go somewhere different.
So, he could have done it to many of us.
I'm trying to go and go.
Do you want to switch it to a weekend?
Do you want to switch it to an uncle?
Because I'm trying to see if we can...
Or maybe it's maybe about eight people, nine people.
And to all of us, that's not a good thing.
He wants to improve it.
So, I wanted to check it around and see if we can get more
from this one and all because he's not the best.
But again, again, in the Ubuntu community,
if you want to get involved inside of our RC,
like at some of the Ubuntu UK channel,
there's lots of other events to get involved.
And again, people like myself,
and we've got an album,
do online discussions or gift talks at these days.
So, if you want to learn more about Ubuntu,
we're going to get it using my community as an example.
It's the same for debut in our cover groups.
And it's just about getting involved in your group.
It's like just talking to somebody in our RC.
Does anybody here actually do work in their community
during Translations,
or go to re-action your documentation?
Okay, it has a pretty good actually like
it should be about seeing their community.
How do people know how to do so?
Do you know how to do it?
Yeah.
But then you don't keep the chat coming in.
Who do you like to be about to be a community?
If you're about to learn it, then you can give your open-source community.
Do you have any preference
like documentation or votes or...?
I don't know.
It just takes no time.
Okay.
Are you involved in any particular distribution
do you like that DNA?
I don't know.
Okay.
So if you actually not want to be one to UK down,
we'll actually put you in the right direction.
But in these Translations,
things and polls and documentation,
there's not for the one to UK coast.
And it's not intimidating at all.
The author on the channel would do dash with testing,
desktop.
And would do one.
So if you join the challenge of my look,
I'd like to help out.
I just don't want to worry to start this on the wrong mentoring projects.
And in that case,
if you don't want to worry to start,
but if you join your local team,
and start from there,
and get to know that people,
who say,
haven't met one another in six months,
already a year.
This is their first outcome.
But they've talked to one another,
RIRC for the last year or two years.
And it's great to report the face to the name.
And you know, it's kind of intimidating,
like,
check off Steve or Dan Fish,
or the other RIRC,
you know,
we're really worried.
It's a RIRC image.
So trying to like, you know,
get rid of the RIRC,
put their face to the real name.
It's a good thing to go to some of that.
And also, in that case,
you want somebody harder to sing.
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
I don't hear it.
I don't hear it.
Okay.
Hi.
I thought we'd find a strange calling,
and just do it to the others.
It's a language.
I can't remember,
it's a language.
No, I can't remember.
It's a language.
I can't remember.
It's a language.
I can't remember.
It's a language.
It's a language.
You can now only have a combination of that.
If you have other names,
but we'll be rewarded.
What should we do to all of them?
So,
if you could speak to me,
and you have this,
an interact,
we'll kind of get together every six months.
We'll be able to develop this on.
And it's for the people from Penaltyville,
and the community.
And if you've been active,
and kind of, you know,
doing stuff I want to get more involved,
you can apply for sponsorship.
I'd be really fortunate
to get sponsor three times
to attend this event.
And it's actually fascinating
to be honest.
We've kind of worked with the labs
doing a build two.
I don't want to be a community
with that team for any stuff.
I mean, I've spoken to people from
Venice,
where I've come to South Africa,
and you've seen it all,
because they wouldn't care
about the chance to meet.
I don't know.
You know,
that was the kind of events
we're talking about.
I want to help people I do so.
And it is just more about
talking to pixels.
I've seen to be honest.
You actually get to meet the rear people.
Well, they've been on friends
because I've got a lot of friends
that I meet here when I travel.
And it's pretty good.
So, again, because of the
over-director,
a lot of people are involved
in communities in the right
areas. If you were a travel
and you're like to stay California
or London,
who would imagine
you could see the events
and you'd actually join with them.
If you don't have to,
like,
belong to those teams,
you can just pop along.
It's kind of a good job.
So these are some of the people
I've actually met,
and I've been to come kind of
a good friend as well,
which is pretty nice.
Again, because I've been not
having none of them
at four or five years ago,
but I know about that
involved in the community.
So there's this.
She is an artist
and there are two years
to come.
She's been to meet me.
But again, it never mattered.
They're not going to love you
even to women.
So we now actually have a
mutual friendship,
called the more so that I
can go to.
And that's a little thing
at that.
You become friends with us.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
A good two.
So, again, I'm from Ireland,
and I release parties.
They're not technical talk.
Because some people
organize release parties
and they have an install fest.
But I am.
And it's a bunch of people
just turned up today.
I had a bunch of week.
I went on the beer
and started writing a movie too.
So people kind of can hear
some people wear panties
and that was harm
and that was a group of a lot of her.
People in the club
that happened a lot of kids.
We had these
emergency CDs and objects
and the provosts.
They're very keen.
Yes.
Got the computers.
And panties.
Okay.
So it's a good way to
just have a conversation.
You would never.
It matters, doesn't it?
It's just about having a social matter.
It's nothing.
I don't release an identity
anymore, to be honest.
I put them on Twitter.
That's me.
That's me.
That's me.
That's me.
That's me.
That's me.
Cool.
Oh, that's mine.
Okay.
I see you.
I see you.
You can hear us.
You can watch us.
You can watch us.
Okay.
We'll show you.
We took about the local scenes.
Yes.
I'll pass by another end of the day.
So,
half of them
is that it's all you want to you can see.
Yes.
So I'm going to switch
a moment.
You've entered out in London.
But at the end of the day,
if you want to have an event
in your area,
it puts the minions going out ahead in
where did it?
No parking.
What about it?
Okay.
I want to know if people
are going to be in this club
or in this place at certain certain time,
and put the minions
or the RC talent,
create the event in the local directory,
and indeed you can create an event,
and just turn up and get me a little involved.
So if you go for a month to read
or just go for a drink or
turn up and say,
I need to help or
just want to get more people involved.
You can do that.
And that is that, you know,
the event you can have a release party
to choice here.
It's in London.
It's up for the last
economical finish.
They worked out with the release.
They're all in the office
and they go to a club.
And people have all
the same playing
and then the day that
the release party is in London.
But there's nothing stopping anybody
across the UK having a release party.
They're where you really isn't.
I think they're always talking about chess.
This is all the questions.
Because it's all about
happening in Manchester.
Yeah.
Even if you're cute.
It is so much easier.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are events happening outside of London.
Yeah.
And there's
students
going to one half events
happening outside of London.
Which are going to go to
London?
Yes.
You should do this.
I'm going to find out.
And see, there's other things happening.
It's just a case that
you want to go to.
If you want more things to happen,
you cannot stop to take the
esa way.
This is just going to be better
in the next assessment,
which is what I want to
go above the executive,
dispersal area as well.
Sorry, it's a seiney時 chin.
Ok.
Do you have anote how I got to
focus on the next room,
about the team have planned for
the next year,
and why not please say
it?
I'll do it.
Okay.
Once again.
Restarily.
Right,
you can
