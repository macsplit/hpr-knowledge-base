Hello podcast listeners and welcome to Huckab Public Radio, I'm your host Phoenix and I'd
like to welcome you today.
I'm very lucky to have Chris John Reilly and Frank Bradick join us on the call today.
To some of you regular listeners you'll know in Episode 420 that Chris and Frank did
a joint call with us to talk about their trip to Vegas for Deathconn.
On the talk they offered to talk about their experiences when they came back from Hacking
at Random and this is the following conversation from the trip to Hacking at Random.
First and foremost I'd like to welcome both of you on to the call thanks very much
Chris for joining us and thanks very much Frank as well and how you both doing.
Pleasure to be here, doing good, just let recover from Hacking at Random.
Yeah thank you for having us again.
Just for people that maybe didn't catch the last episode of D2 on, would you both give
us a brief introduction we'll start with you Frank.
Well I'm from Daydeck, I work for Schubert Phyllis in the Netherlands as security engineer
trying to keep infrastructure secure and on the author of the program called Autoneses.
My name is Chris John Reilly, I work for a bank in Austria as a penetration tester.
Okay, okay, thank you and I'm Phoenix for all of you guys that don't know me by now.
Typically I think the easiest thing to start off with for people who are not too sure is
maybe to get one of you to actually maybe describe what the Hacking at Random event is.
Well it's kind of hard to explain to me so people who've been to other kind of security
conferences.
This isn't the kind of conference where you go to a huge building, there's a couple of
tracks you're sitting on talks and they put on a nice lunch for you.
This is more like a couple of thousand people gather in a field and a conference breaks
out which is it's kind of nice, it's a break away from the usual stuff, it gives you
more of a chance to network with people hanging around, there's always party going on
somewhere, everyone's intense so there's a lot more kind of freedom to kind of move around
and talk to people.
Yeah, it's also a self-organizing camp in the way that a lot of things have been told
out and being pretty arranged but there's also a much needed input of everybody who is
there.
They're always looking for volunteers, I think every ticket that they bring out actually
says volunteer ticket to sort of get you in the spirit.
But it's also, yeah, it must be one of the most well-connected campsites in the world.
I think in terms of internet capacity, they have something like 10 gigabit of internet
capacity there for 2,300 people and yeah, that's a lot of bandwidth to get into a field.
Yeah, and they actually kept telling people pretty much off the air group presentation
that we weren't using enough bandwidth which is quite entertaining because usually at
these kind of conferences, the whole thing is saturated and there's no way you can get
online.
There was such a good connection, you could just log on and you could download anything
you want but then a couple of seconds.
I was getting like a 3.7 megabits a second which is pretty fast.
So I mean if we were kind of summing up quickly, it's sort of like a very community lad
and inspired sort of event then in a field.
Oh yeah, I mean you've got to think it's not really a pure security conference.
There's a lot of security stuff going on, there's people talking about, I mean, dank
them and skippers there talking about his SSL stuff and there's various other people
talking about like their MPLS and the BGP problems but there's also people talking about
things like social issues, political issues in different countries as well as kind of
really kind of different stuff that you won't see anywhere else as a guy presenting
about how to make prosthetics for $50 instead of $250.
So it's stuff that you're just not going to see anywhere else.
It's really unique.
Yeah, if you want to put the event next to the artistic of Black Hat and Defcon, Black
Hat, corporate, well arranged, everything arranged for you, Defcon, more attack conference
with less organized but still everything organized and I think hacking at random would qualify
almost as a hacking lifestyle event but that makes it sound too polished.
Oh yeah, there was a lot of randomness about hacking at random, it sounds ironic but it's
I mean people, for example Frank, I think you ran two workshops and you Frank on
also an SS.
I mean, it was great, you simply put on the wiki, I'm doing a workshop on this topic at
this tent at this time and people just turn up, you know, people want to learn about it.
So people just come and they'll sit down and they'll learn with you, there was a hardware
hacking tent for people who went and did hardware staff, there was a lot of picking
tent, people just went and were picking locks all day and all night, much of the time as
well.
So it was really kind of a very very social event.
Does it have this kind of user group sort of feel about it, I mean I'm a big fan of
user groups and been involved in them for a wee while now and what I found at user
groups is that if someone's prepared to go and do a workshop or a talk, people are
generally prepared to come and listen and participate and be part of it, does it have
that sort of kind of community involvement and you know, I suppose if you've done two
workshops, you'll probably be the better person to answer that question.
Yes, it does but if you go to user groups, there's usually a us against a world type of
attitude going on and I know I'm offending people so there may be a bit, but it's
always the the Unix user group and don't show up with a laptop that runs with those.
Whereas as part of hacking at random is not going outside your user group and finding
other people who yet to show your work to and maybe they work up an interest or maybe
you'll pick up an alternative point of view.
Yeah, I mean, I think that's very fair criticism of user groups generally as well.
I don't think you're wrong to say that and I don't think you'll take any flut for that either
that they can be very cliquey, you know, and well I mean don't get me wrong, there were
kind of user groups there who wanted to get their point across, but as there were so
many other people, there was so many different opinions, there wasn't a clash, it was more
of a mixing of people with different ideas.
I mean, the reason that I kind of mentioned that is that when I see user groups normally
what you have is this core contingent that manages and runs and looks after user groups
and makes sure that it moves running and then what happens is that you'll get someone
who comes and does a workshop on our stress and you'll find that, you know, all of these
people around the user could slightly relate it to the user group or know if someone involved
in the user group or turns up and what I found is that when you have lots of work groups
and stuff like that, you know, it's amazing when you find the people who are interested
and I was just wondering if having it around them kind of had that same feel and I suppose
and but I suppose with it not being anyone's user group as well is probably why you don't
get that cleakiness from as well because, you know, if you come to my town, you're in
my town and my user group doing my, you know what I mean and I can see what Frank was saying
quite, you know, very clearly I suppose, I suppose with it being in that.
Well yeah, I mean there's this, sorry, there's sort of, I mean there's such a flexibility
about it as well.
I mean there's, there's three tracks of talks going on at any one time, there's probably
two workshops going on and that's the people who want to go and do something in a workshop.
There's a lot of people at the camp who didn't go to any talks, they simply went and they
had a project in mind, they got, they got four or five people together in a big ten
and they just did a project for three or four days and that's, there was quite a lot
of that kind of using the conference as a chance to get a group that might not be one place
together to do some real, real work on an open source project or an idea and try and move
things forward.
I mean you see that quite a lot of the CCC conference in December is people just sitting
around the table who will sit there for two or three days just simply, you're doing
a project and that's something you don't usually see at the big conferences like that
definitely.
It sounds absolutely awesome to have a conference on a camping site, I mean it just, it seems
that you're not kind of constrained by if you're in a hotel, you know, it just seems
like even the environment itself lands itself up to being open and a little bit more relaxed
and a little bit more free and a little bit more rough and rugged there I say, I mean
I've not been so I mean that's just a, you know, conjecture really on my part but it sounds
like even the whole environment set up is set up to be relaxed and open, you know, it's
certainly one of the first kind of hacking, you know, event conferences that I've heard
that's basically in a field, I mean it sounds like Graftonbury for Harkers.
Yeah, that's how it's marketed, it's pretty much Graftonbury for Harkers.
It's one of the funny things that happened to me is I was just trying to get out of
the world, I was trying to get out, I was walking away from our tent and there's a guy
coming in and he dresses well for one of my co-workers and he says, you're the guy from
Chupa Phyllis, yeah, he is Frank there and do I know you and says no but thanks you, thank
you for writing all this and this is my life easier and I'm like, oh my god, I actually have
users and that was just a random guy showing up because yeah, everything is open, there's
no barriers to approach people. Yeah, I sat down with the guys from C-base with a big multi-touch
display with them and I just sat down and we had to be together and okay, tell me how this works,
where do I get one because I like it and yeah, the answer was well, you have to build one yourself
but this is the website where the schematics are. So it's really open, it's the people that
make hacking at random and yes, there's a great program going on as well, obviously that
they're best to get the infrastructure in place but it's in the end, it's the mix of people
that make it what it is. I mean, I talk a little bit about what you were doing, you've
touched on slightly there, what you were doing there Frank was a lot of where you were going
to hacking at random to work and promote auto-nesses or be there for something, you were there for
a number of reasons or were you there primarily to get, you know, auto some, you know, some sound
bite for auto-nesses and get people involved and seeing it. The way it came on my part is a couple
of my colleagues went there four years ago and they were keen, yeah, they were dead set on
ongoing there again. So I went, okay, I'll go as well but what are we going to do and it was,
okay, can you, can you do another workshop? One of my co-workers and I haven't, I haven't
crossed my mind at all and then when I did the first workshop and I heard that there were people
that were actually set, they missed it, okay, I'll do another one and I was here just to learn
the reason why I go to conferences and I found out at the end that I got a lot more than I
had an embarking for. In a positive sense. Yeah, I mean I went to one of the auto-nesses
workshops and I mean I learned a lot about auto-nesses while I was there. So and I have to apologize
for Frank because I had said that I was going to do a workshop at the village and due to some illness
between DEF CON and packing around and I didn't get his chance to prepare enough to be able to do
the workshop. So I left him apologize to Frank for that. So Chris, I mean what were you there
just discovering and being part of or were you there for any particular reason or was it just
for the whole environment and to be involved? For me it was kind of like a homecoming, I mean two
years ago, I mean just through that expression of the way it works as it runs every four years
in an evidence and every four years in just nibbling in Germany. So and they overlapped. So
every two years as a conference visit is one of the middle of a field in Germany or is one of the
middle of the field in an evidence as long as legislation doesn't change in an evidence and
lock it next time. So I mean two years ago in Berlin was the first time I ever went to a
hacker conference and I had such a great time. I mean I the one thing I learned from the conference
last time I went was what I did not know anything and that was a great, it was a great feeling.
After working in the same industry for 10 years I suddenly went to a conference and realized
there was so much more to learn, I did not know any of it which was brilliant because it started me
off on a career in purity and got me wearing up today working as a penetration tester and it
was a great experience. So I wanted to go back again, see the people I met originally two years ago
and it was kind of like a what I'm down from black hand death call for me. Plus I mean how many
conferences can you go to where there's an entire deck telephone network running just for the
people at the conference and there's an entire GSM network for people who can make calls to other
people on the same GSM network inside the camp. I mean you just can't get that kind of thing.
Yeah or when they where they reproduce the bar tokens with their own
rapid replication machines which are by the way self replicating. I mean you get people there
with basically any any angle it's hacker in the almost in the original
meaning of the work. So not not a computer hacker but somebody who has a
different take on technology.
Yeah I mean they were talking so I went to I thought oh this is going to be about
security because of that my mind set on on that. So for example there was a talk someone gave
on the IBM AS-400s a bit of an old topic but it was like a check and a full introduction to it
and I mean it was really really really interesting there wasn't a whole lot of security in there which
kind of disappointed a few people but it was just a really interesting talk. Someone had taken
something that people weren't talking about was like people are interested in this I'll just talk
about it and there were so many other things that were just completely random you you would never
have thought about about going to a talk that talked about you know a WikiLeaks was a big theme
there and you know you know WikiLeaks or yeah you know they're a they have a hard time didn't they
you know but they must have some incredibly interesting stories you know and oh yeah I mean
they had a lot of content there as well and they were you're kind of interacting with people
they weren't just sitting there and talking this is what we do they did the kind of this sort we
do this is how we do it but then they they had two additional sessions on the over the next
couple of days where they actually got people around and discussed what they could do to make things
better you know it was kind of like a panel discussion with interaction from the crowd and it was
they were taking comments from other people to make things better and to be able to you know
use other people's ideas to try and make their systems and the way they run things better which
is it completely against what other large corporates do because they're just no we're going to do
what we want to do whereas everyone there was very open if you had something uh to put forward then
you know they they answered the question even if it was a difficult question they better they'd
still answer the question I mean it was there was a you know you're you're kind of taking the
wind out of ourselves there because there was about to say you know if you had a new project it
sound like an absolutely brilliant place to actually let people to go around and play with it and
give you feedback and look at it it sounds like a a really good place if you you've you've got an
idea that you actually want to go and and see what the rest of the world thinks of it you know
it sounds like an awesome venue for that to be honest with you yeah well one of the things that
happened though is that they uh in terms of of of call for papers and and talks uh I had a
little bit of an insight as one of my my colleagues is in the the organization and I think they had a
three or four to one turnout for call for papers and and speaker slots
there were absolutely overbooked in that respect um but but then again you always have the
happy opportunity like I did to just put it in a wiki and and and make sure you had enough room in a
tent to to attract people and and to to do your talk now and I almost think that's better sometimes
sometimes those if you have a specific topic that's very niche you know very interesting to like
maybe twenty thirty people you're not going to pack out a room of three hundred four hundred people
so sometimes it's always better just say look you know I just want to take this to a smaller tent
and just sit and talk about it and make everyone aware that it's happening and that's you know that
that's just a perfect avenue for that you're hiking around them just to kind of doing a workshop
or just doing a presentation in front of 20 or 30 people I mean Frank I'm going to pick on you
slightly don't have to be honest with you I mean as as the as the author of auto analysis
how much did how much do you think hacking at random is going to help you push auto
analysis further by having these workshops and they're having kind of face to face contact
with actual users of your of your of auto analysis how did you what did you take away from that
not as an attendant but as as is actually the author of auto analysis how much did you take
away from that if anything well first of all the shopping experience that I do indeed have
users of course I knew that like I get the the the all email asking a question or or saying
thanks but somebody coming up and being able to talk okay how do you use it that really helps
right now I'm in correspondence with a guy from the Netherlands who's said okay this is going
to help us I'm going to set up I need to set up a demo environment to to demonstrate this to
my my coworkers on Thursday so yeah I am getting there will it get me well domination probably not
yeah but I did reach I did reach in all the ends it it get people to to come and and look
for for what I do which isn't yeah to give you new ideas about you may be some of the
directions you want to take with auto analysis or did it just give you confidence that it was
actually really nice that you know it's strange because I can sort of empathize with what you're
saying about you know it was amazing for you to know that you've got users you know you get
this in podcasts and as well that from yeah you get the occasional email and some of them
are nice and some of them are bad but occasionally but it's actually when you you you you meet someone
who uses the resources that you produce and you actually get to see that person and they get you
know I took I remember the first time that someone said to me oh I listened to one of your
podcasts and you know the guy from HPR is really good to speak to you blah blah blah and I took a
lot away from that now I have a lot that I had a few emails before that and I suppose that with
the fact that that you don't see that person's face face to face you know they're just a name
and an email address in some ways so I can kind of totally empathize with you saying you know it
must have been nice to actually be able to have people say oh you're the guy that does auto
and I says brilliant you know so but back to the question before I go on a tangent
do you do you think that helped maybe gave you more confidence to know that you really
actually do have users using it on a day's day and then off to come to a workshop
yeah yeah no and and yeah I did get constructive feedback as well into other people not
there's just some bits about it which aren't the most intuitive way I put them together and
if you do a workshop you keep hitting those points so I really need to work on that as well
and I think I talked a little bit in the workshop about where I want to take it got a good
feedback on that so yeah it does really help but it's not the single experience I have from
I was going to say now as I said I was going to pick on you slightly because I'm interested in
and you know projects and people managing projects and because it sounds like an awesome venue
to do it but then as a security consultant what did you take out of it as well do you know take
the auto and SS hat off for a second and just purely as Frank as a security consultant what
what did you what did you what were you left thinking what was the feeling you were left with after
the whole event well first of all I mean maybe we were we're being too careful about this being
our job as well but I mean I had a blast at hacking at random and a lot of that was not to do
with the security program but more with the show we say after 11 program so yeah there was
there was a lot of fun but also from a security perspective I certainly talked about
a DNS sec left me with okay this is really an area that I do need to pick up yeah I mean I'm
with you on that helium the DNS stuff was really good I mean must have been about three talks on
DNS sec again we kind of merged some together with the IPv6 stuff as well but DNS sec and the
open gsm project were pretty big that and wiki leaks and Chris I mean what was I mean you
touched on this before but you know the sort of your homecoming you know but what was it like
coming back you know what was it two years since you were last that one you were saying you know
you've done deaf gone you know you've done deaf gone since then and you know you're more
established than as a penetration tester you know what's the homecoming length for you there you know
was I honestly expected I mean I wasn't expecting so much but I was kind of expecting
to kind of go back and think okay I'm gonna know what these talks are about now I do
and what I learned again and it was good to relearn that is there's always something you don't know
and yeah I understood the talks more I knew where things were headed I knew when they were talking
about DNS sec I wasn't DNS what you know I know where that stuff's heading which is nice to kind
of get a modern update on where DNS sec is right now where it goes in the future and it was
actually more nice to actually get together with people I knew people I've met before I mean
getting together with Frank again after blackhand deaf gone you know Frank doesn't mean barbecue
so it was it was always good to kind of get together with him and have a quick barbecue around
around the tent area and then have a couple of drinks and it really was a lot of socializing you
know it's just it was it was really interesting to be out of the you know kind of heading back to
your tent at two o'clock in the morning and then just randomly meet someone and decide let's
just watch them moving I met Benny who's security for all on Twitter who I know from from last
year and this is his year then and as Benny key this legal is the he I've interviewed him previously
the organizer of brucon which is Brussels security conference coming up on the 19th to September
and obviously I'm sure everyone on this call you know tell everyone who's in who's anywhere near
Brussels to be to be going to that event Benny's a great guy but yeah definitely it's a great event
so yes I met him randomly at two o'clock in the morning they decided we watched him
him America on a projector in the tent there was so we started the movie with two of us within
about 10 minutes there was 30 people and it was a party and it's just if random spontaneous things
just happen and and that was that was just really special it was just it's it's not an important event
all we did was watch a movie but randomly it is suddenly you know 28 people just kind of wandered
in and we're like great you watch the movie we were all singing along to the song still four o'clock
in the morning and drinking beer and if that was was the event for me I mean I learned a lot
by going to some of the talks I met a lot of new interesting people but I also got to dissocialize
with people and and do stuff that just you kind of relaxes you and sometimes you just need that
especially after black cat and death got funny funny things you meet very funny people
people that you didn't know previously but also something like Felix Lindner and he did talk
about how to exploit Cisco iOS on on black hat and there he sort of well he's the speaker it's
it's a bit harder to get to approach him to have a lay down talk and then all of a sudden you're
attacking at random and you find yourself at a barbecue and he's there and we're asking him if
he wants his rib ribs juicy or crispy and that sort of puts the conversation in another
completely other perspective and yeah you can go much more or into yeah much more detail or
yes get to know what what drives people like Felix better so if I was to ask you I kind of
sure I know what the answer is going to be for both of you here if actually this the last time
at that about deathcon if you could have one word to describe hacking at random what word would it be
Chris one word to describe such an event is a little bit tricky the last event
would have to be beer basically belled and beer the last event which is which is very good
it's great stuff for the con I mean you can't you can't really kind of take an event so unique as
that and kind of break it down into one word because I mean well you know front there was such
a variety of stuff I was hoping what you'd actually say was random because it does it sounds
like an awfully random event you know in a good way you know that that it's just you know if you
couldn't prepare for deathcon how I'm actually going to prepare for hacking at random and I think
you did a great job of explaining it at the beginning that you went come in a security conference
broke out and you know it was there there is no preparation for that at random you simply put
some clothes in the bag and you go I mean I didn't even have a tent when I turned up
it's one of those things there's so many friendly people around there if you turn up without
something someone will lend you it someone will provide it you universal currency at hacking at random
is Chris's keyword beer so if you need it we have guys like okay I need a mini USB cable
who's willing to trade it for a beer and and and he gets one and that's that's that's fun as well
but the other thing to understand is and I didn't get that when I started but actually people
around the event are in a sense very very honest it the woodstock yeah the woodstock for hackers
is is in a sense very true we organized the silent disco on Saturday night it was very funny
but yeah one of the people that was there was very nervous about the hapsack so you you
silent disco works this way you've got DJs and you get a nice sanitizer headsets you put on
and you can actually select which DJ you're going to listen to and you can dance and they
belong to playing and we were very worried that okay here we are giving out 100 headsets which
cost about a hundred euros each how much are not going to be returned when we started packing
we were only too short so there were two missing okay
the seems like we dropped somebody from the call but we were two missing and in the end we
when we were packing we had one missing and then next morning you put on the wiki on the last
and found by it's hey we're still missing a missing a headset and somebody turned up sorry I
fell asleep with him and returned him yeah I've seen this on you I've seen you actually
Twitter this at the time and I thought it was you know I seen you Twitter from beginning to end
you know all these two headsets missing can you know if you've got them please you know
please return them and then I saw you Twitter again and say right you know I you know they've
been returned back to us and I thought wow that's you know really really amazing because you must
have expected maybe for one or two to go missing you know obviously you'd hope it wouldn't but
especially with that many headsets going out you know just you'd have thought it would have
happened but it sounds and I like to say I mean I've seen you Twitter about that through that
and I thought wow that was really good now I you're right someone did drop off the call I can see
that that Chris dropped off there it's fine I'm back oh you're back I'll have to I'll have to
try and kick you off again I'm only giving oh sorry just doesn't take me off the bill stuff
that happened at the the silent disco if that whole another podcast there is there that's the
whole another yeah that's a whole another another podcast I think no I mean it was a great event
it was one of those things where you never forget dancing in the middle of a field wearing headsets
and singing along to the music singing happy birthday was one of the funiest things ever
when you took my headsets off and realized that one was gonna need key if it's very interesting
the interest of trying to keep this this not sure but you know you know in the interest
of wrapping up I suppose is the first thing to say is there anything that you guys would like
to say about hacking at random for the HPR audience if you go and don't just go there to consume
obviously this is going to be in another two or four years depending on where you go but
for me volunteering I volunteered on first aid shift and I would have loved to
to help it build up and break that being more or less a local but couldn't for for private reasons
but that really adds to to the whole atmosphere as well yeah I mean I have to make sure that there's
the sentiment is there's two things I really wanted to say was one never ever fly with sky
Europe but that's again another podcast in itself that's yeah took me 18 hours to get home
thanks to sky Europe but also I mean it's a very community driven event I mean if you turn up
and you just expect someone to be there is going to give you technical talks and then at the end
of it you're going to go home then you're not going to get as much out of it as you could
it's all about meeting people talking to people helping other people and being flexible I mean
the talks don't start until 11 o'clock or midday and they don't finish until midnight and sometimes
you know I think in Berlin they're going on till two o'clock in the morning it's a 24 or 7 of
event if you go to bed at midnight every night then you're going to miss out on six or seven hours
of very interesting stuff so you need to be very flexible on what you do and make sure you just
go out and meet people because it's very easy to be isolated at those kind of events because you
don't know people but if you just go and say hello to people then you'll be involved in the event
it's going to be so much more fun yeah no it's with the program no I remember I remember doing
the silent disco and then then popping my head around into the studio of the of the local FM
station the the camp had its own FM radio station and we're actually people there still still
still doing quite an interesting talk on on on a subject that I have forgotten because I just
pop my head around but yeah there's just always a lot going on and focus on what you can attend
don't focus on what you miss because that drives you nuts yeah and don't and don't try and plan
because it's just not going to work if you write down every talk you want to see then you're
going to miss out on a lot of the fun and things are not going to go well the best thing is just
to kind of turn up be friendly be nice to people involve yourself in the community and if you
happen to be walking past one of the conference areas and there's an interesting talk going on
when you just pop in and you go and you go to the talk and if it's not interesting then you wander
off and use something else now as as a ritual is on podcasts is there anything that you guys want
to you know in a shameless self promotion or plug anything is there anything that yourself you
want to plug Chris or anything like that um yeah I support the Autonomous project definitely
um because I know Frank won't say it but he's done a really good job with his software and
I wish I could be using it um it's a great project and if more people help then it will be
even better so though you know I'd like to plug Frank's project and and and HBR listeners take
take notice of that Frank is doing a very good job it's a very good project and and and definitely
that that's and obviously now we've promoted you Frank is there anything you'd like to promote
Bernie well I mean obviously one one of the side objectives that both both Chris and I got
there was to to write something in the blog and I think actually this time you get produced blog posts
that Chris so yeah I did you know I wasn't drunk I did actually write something this time so
I run actually I didn't write anything at death con where I was depressed and I did write stuff
for acting at random where I wasn't so I need to be arranging that next time no I think I think
here at press pass actually even a bigger ref like than at death con I think I think a press pass
for acting at random would pretty much be the same as a non press pass you still have to volunteer
and you still have to pay you just get to not talk to people because you're a member of the press so
yeah you know and I touched on can I ask you both a question are you going you guys going to
brew con this year is the first year I think it's going isn't it but we'll either of you be going
to brew con I'll definitely be there yeah because it changed I'm going to every single conference
this year so you're hanging to a media horror as well I mean as conference horror is not as in
someone you see a conference while the conference is finished just in case anyone's getting the
wrong idea there it's just in someone who goes to lots of conferences but yeah Frank are you going
to brew con I have something on my personal agenda that that prevents me probably will prevent
me from going there but I still have to see how I fit it in but one of the things I did
did happen to me at acting at random is that I got invited for confidence in more share
in November so that's a definite yes okay well you know if you say Chris you know
it'd be if you Frank as well if if you guys do you know if well Chris I'd love to talk to you
after brew con I'm not going to be able to make it to to brew con I'm doing a vent and
in Scotland for software freedom day which ends on the 19th and I believe brew con ends on the 19th as well
yeah that's right but I and obviously the invitation to you as well Frank if you do make it to
brew con I'd love to actually be able to get a chat to you about brew con as well especially seems
have interviewed Benny as well I know brew con's you know I wish them all the best and you know
and anyone that doesn't know I think it's the 17th to the 19th of September or something like that
yeah it's around that time there are some training courses shortly before the event as well so
and I think there's very limited space on training I seem to remember there's some posts on
Twitter today that there's only a handful of places left so if you're interested in doing the
training you should really get in touch with them as soon as possible yeah I think you can find
it if what is it brew con.org or or something brew con.org yeah they actually have a podcast
me as well not to take away from a Republic Radio but they're doing a couple of interviews with
people who are doing talks so I think if you look on to iTunes and do a search for brew con you
should find the brew con podcast yeah and they're on Twitter as well and you can find them
information about brew con very easily the usual mechanisms you'll find brew con information so
anyone who is in Europe Brussels do make the effort and Chris I'll talk to you about it after
the call but I really would love to chat to you you know after brew con if that would be okay
do you happy to all I all that's left for me to do is to obviously thank you too for both
taking the time out to speak to me it's obviously it's great for me I didn't get any of the conferences
this year so it's great to be able to speak to people that didn't get the feedback and I'm sure
