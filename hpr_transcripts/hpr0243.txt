I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't

It took the cashier, three years to ring it all up and then she gave you the total
and you paused and whipped out your checkbook and began to write it,
why didn't you do that ten minutes ago, you as you began to write
minors began to twinge, go home and work on your windows box
Cause I don't know you but I sure do hate you and even though I'll never see you again
My heart holds a special piece of hate just for you, just for you, just for you
I was sitting behind you in my car and had a stoplight that was liver too long
You were pounding at your pocket PC that was running some version of Windows XP
And the light changed and you sat there trying to get exchange mobile to work
And I cursed you silently and then laid on my horn
Cause I don't know you but I sure do hate you and even though I'll never see you again
My heart holds a special piece of hate just for you, yeah my heart holds a special piece of hate just for you
And yeah my heart holds a special piece of hate just for you, just for you
And yeah my heart holds a special piece of hate
And yeah my heart holds a special piece of hate just for you, just for you
