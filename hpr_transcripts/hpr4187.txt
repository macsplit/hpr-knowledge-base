This is Hacker Public Radio, episode 4187 for Tuesday, the 20th of August 2024.
Today's show is entitled Go Fish Card Game.
It is hosted by Al and is about three minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is a simple card game you can play this summer.
Hi, I'm Al from the Tux Jam pod card.
This episode is about an easy to learn card game called Go Fish.
We like to play this when we go camping, but you can play it anywhere at home or from
a vacation holiday, it can be with friends and family, it can be played by adults and
children.
It's easy to learn, it's a great laugh and get very frustrating and we'll get you laughing.
It's best to play with three players or more.
We've had up to plays with seven or more and it works really well.
Each player is dealt seven cards, the remaining cards form a pile in the centre face down.
The object of the game is to have the most sets of cards by the end.
A set is to find a four cards at the same rank, such as all the free's or all the kings.
The suits of the cards are irrelevant in this game.
Determine who will take the first turn.
This player must have a card at the rank, they intend to ask for in their hand.
They then inquire from another player if they have any of the cards of that specific rank.
For example, Oscar, do you have any fives?
If Oscar had any fives, he must give them to the asking player.
The player who has requested the cards gets another turn.
They can ask any of the other players.
When a player asks for a card and a player does not have the card in the hand, they say
go fish.
And the player who has asked the question must draw a card from the pile.
Their turn is over and passes to the next player in the clockways direction.
So, if they Oscar had in his hand two fives, he has to give them two fives, you don't
just give them one, you just give them how many fives you have in your hand.
If a player collects four cards of the same rank, they form a set and they are placed
aside.
If a player runs out of cards, they can draw from one from the pile and ask the card of
that rank.
If there are no more cards left in the pile, that player adds the game.
But don't worry, you can still win.
The game continue to all the cards have been played.
Because all the cards are played, the player with the most sets wins.
This game is both amazing and challenging, as it will certainly make you laugh as you discover
what cards other players hold.
For instance, if Oscar has one five, Josie has two fives and Al has one five and Rainy
has none, Oscar can ask Josie if she has any fives and since she does, she has to give
the cards to Oscar.
He then gets never turned at an arse rainy, but she doesn't have any, so she says go fish.
Now Al knows that Oscar has three fives in his hand, so when it's Al's turn, he can
ask Oscar if he has any fives and since he does, he has to hand them over.
This way, Al wins that set of cards.
Give it a try and you'll find yourself laughing at frustration, I'll include the rules
of the games in the show notes.
