So
So we can record a few sessions at the same time.
We can record a few sessions at the same time.
Multi-generational, multi-platform, multi-culture, multi-inspirational.
I like that.
What do you want to do?
Wait, where are you from?
I've never seen this before.
Well, maybe there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
I want to remind you that today is the last week in here.
Then, from next week, we are going to be in this place here.
Do you always come?
It's on your screen.
You know, if we have one down this side.
There's a room and the air object here.
Yeah, like an eight foot screen there.
It's very clean.
It's clean.
It's big and clean.
Let's go ahead.
It's very clean.
It's very clean.
It's very clean.

I was trying to have this one.
I didn't know.
I don't know.
I saw it.
Is it really glue or something else?
Yes.
You know, it doesn't need to be this clean.
It doesn't need to be that clean.
You know, it doesn't need to be this clean.
It doesn't need to be this clean.
It doesn't need to be that clean.
It's like..
It still works.
It still works.
It still works.
It still works.
Too hard.
Too hard.
Too hard.
I've been there a while, thanks.
Hi wife and I are playing a summer volleyball league.
That happened again.
There's been an incident so that's why I've been gone for a while and stuff.
We're back into the fall routine and we got around to it.
She's got a different job.
We're in second shift.
My evenings are more free and stuff and I wanted to come back here.
We ran.
Play at Loopies.
No, it looks like it's a month's time.
Amazing.
Somebody who doesn't play at Loopies.
You know, Loopies are actually dead.
They got a dolma.
Yeah, I know.
I play at cool.
I play at one day.
Oh really?
Is it live?
Is it live?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You haven't been there a while.
Too many took part.
Yeah.
No, he's not found something.
He's got three volleyball cards and one of his had a big blogdom and found
a bit fan in there.
And he's got an evolving board and he's having out and the bars set up in there, and
offering doors.
All the doors.
Yep.
Just keep coming from the chef.
Just that bunch of work.
You know what, just gotta make sure those don't have a tape.
They can get stuck in the revolving door and, you know what I mean.
No jokes.
No, it's not a major problem.
No.
Actually, they're saying before we start building, they're saying that it's all right.
I didn't hear that much, but...
I believe it.
Heated with the pressurized air in there, and his heated coils in the sand.
So, your feet don't get cold, and they can play full-year-round vitally.
He said he's going to be up to about 75 in there in the middle of the winter.
Well, actually, I like it about 50, because otherwise it starts to sweat because you're playing volleyball.
Yeah.
Then you get even warmer then.
Yes, warm.
What do you think?
Interestingly enough, I bet you the drinks are going to get a little bit more expensive in the dome.
Because it's still a broader.
Well, you can't have glass in the dome either.
No, well, it doesn't have a lot of glass.
It's really, really expensive.
Oh, I suppose we're safe here.
I don't want to be slashing at the dome.
Yeah, there's summer, and the dome was slowly done there.
But, uh, all the concrete work was done.
Yeah, he can actually only have it up half the air.
Otherwise, it would be considered a permanent dome.
And it had to...
Hey, taxes on it.
So, it's only up for 179 days on the air.
Well, that's about your heating season, you know?
Yeah, exactly.
So, maybe, well, I've been playing with a couple of things.
One thing I was playing with was Spence, which is an open source voice recognition package.
And I actually got it to recognize some words amazingly.
It's supposedly one of the more difficult things to get working.
They don't really have good tutorials, good information on it.
But, I was able to get at least the basic,
little voice recognition to work.
And, I learned that my microphone really sucks.
And, it couldn't do a very good job with recognizing words.
I've maybe got about 50 to 60% accuracy.
Can you try the Mary Poppins word?
Not the one.
I've got them over there.
No.
The thing is, you can customize it so that you can say,
only detect these words.
And then, you can give the likelihood of each of those words.
So, then, you can actually get the percentages up much higher.
It's trying to recognize, you know, 40,000 words versus trying to recognize 10.
So, I wasn't able to get any of that work.
Yeah, just command line.
You have it running and it spits out the word that you sent.
More or less, yeah.
And, I mean, you could then plug that into something else.
You know, like a command line or what?
I think those were in it.
I mean, you just say, he, and it considers that a word.
Like, you can do like all the pronunciations and everything you say.
Like, one is, you know, actually three.
I can't remember what they call that.
Three sounds put together.
So, then, it's got like a faceless of like 40 years with these sounds.
And all the words are made up of those sounds.
So, you just spell them all phonetically.
And then, it can, you know, base it off of that.
So, I don't know.
So, play with that some more.
You know what?
You can try that at the time.
You can try that, but I would just type it.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
So, is that possible?
Yeah.
Okay.
What else did I do when I got bullshit stuff?
So, I went using it.
I went to a little bit making fun of Silence, other sweet stuff.
For defenseless subuckens,
Just actually making runs instead of like Stripes.
And it looks like the API is pretty easy.
So, I might try to like add in something simple like that.
So that you write book on it, and you watch it.
Yeah, actually I was going to maybe start off with something that connected to like a subversion repository
and put a different emblem on it based on its status.
Just start with that and go walk with it.
Oh, that's great.
But there's a version of Java.
Actually, they have a native C library as well, which that's probably what I would use.
Because all the APIs for the plugin are all in C.
So that's just the right now all in the subversion.
Yep, here's the audio.
If I just did that in five minutes, I was here.
Oh, let's see.
Did I do anything else?
You made a flyer.
I just did that in five minutes, I was here.
Right, I'm not done yet.
Do I have anything else open?
One question.
How do you set the limit of open files that one user can have?
If I defaulted set to a 1024 open file.
I think you're maybe you come across this.
Do you always have tons and tons of tabs open?
No.
Yeah, we come across that.
Okay.
Because yeah, come across that once or twice where it'll say,
for it won't display an image.
And I'll close it, open it up in the command line.
It'll be okay for a little while.
And then I'll actually get a message.
Too many files.
Something similar to that.
I don't know what it is.
But that's something that's 1024 across the entire user.
That user can have 1024 files open.
That's it.
So...
Prox is a file man.
You see, and I've looked at that, but I didn't think that actually...
It's just a very, very file.
I did a Google search for what he was talking about.
It came across an article in...
It says in CentOS.
It's not very consistent with other districts too.
Oh, that's what that was.
That's the system wide number of files.
But not the per user.
Oh, you want the user.
I want the per user because it limits each instance to 2024.
I mean, it's the rest of the world.
That should have somewhere pretty similar.
I've always been able to do that.
Okay.
Like in RC.
It's a product.
It's this FS file man.
I do it.
I'll just write it over.
Run is right.
Good idea.
That's a security answer.
It's mine.
It's mine.
Never know another problem.
Okay.
I mean, what's it using me?
You want it in me.
Because that's where I actually got it.
And even if there is a limit.
And it's supposedly you can set it using the E-Limit command.
But then I looked at more documentation.
I said, you can't set it with the E-Limit command.
The E-Limit command has the ability to set it.
But the kernel won't do it.
So it's like some kernels that I'm somewhere.
And I can't figure out how to do it.
It might be in one of the startup scripts.
But I haven't found anything yet.
Kernel configs maybe.
Where?
And I mean, yeah, I mean, it's got the manageable file for the entire system, but not for the user.
It didn't like E-Limit, or E-Limit.
E-Limit is the name of the file.
There's a press right there.
I think if I go E-Limit, and then it says the number file, 1024.
And you can do it.
And you're supposed to be able to set it like that.
But if you do it, okay.
And as I said it, it says I said, well, I'm broke.
I can set it.
Now if I exit E-Limit, and E-Limit dash in 1024, I try and set it.
I can't set it because I'm not root.
If I change the root, now I'm root.
I can set it in E-Limit.
There's a way that you can create like a...
Is there a way that you can change through the E-Limit setting?
Maybe when you do it as maybe you have to do the E-Limit and say which user you're setting for.
Maybe it's something that you have to set up like in S.
That's a variable in your like profile or something that it sets it up.
Just for that specific directory in the beginning.
And I tried that too.
Like somebody did suggest that and I tried it.
I wasn't able to get it to work.
I don't know what the real competition was for.
I could put it in a chart.
So if there's an option for you or a bad career, what are you doing that you have my name?
Well, I had three columns worth of tabs open in Opera.
Yeah, see, it's got a user name.
I never thought it would come out of my name.
It's time to do it.
For like local data users.
For example, U-Limit, Dash, Shubber, Winger, Enterprise, and CIS.
You know what?
Well, depending on your name.
Valid number.
Oh, my name is number.
Just do it.
Reuser 500.
So I'm trying to put my name on your name together.
Just take a step yourself.
Yeah.
Take a step yourself.
Take a step yourself.
Take a step yourself.
Wow, that's good.
Let's keep on moving on.
I didn't have a name.
You're a call.
Yeah.
I got a class certificate.
I got two hours off.
Yeah, that was really good.
How about you?
Well, there was a lucky week.
I was trying to do something called Pi BKM.
All the rats, which is part of my name.
It's my book house that I control.
And it's got something to do with the WX Python stuff.
For some reason, it was not finding pieces of that.
It needs, I've used every switch on the mates, and build, and you can fix, to tell it to build everything.
And then you have some reason for more work.
So I'm still figuring that out.
And I was also trying to get free URL and open URL to work, because the GTK look at,
and that other view of the WRL class that comes with Ubuntu, they're not too good Christmas,
but they don't have a way to rotate the object.
And like if you're looking at virtual monitor, it's pretty dull just to slide it back and forth.
So it's got something to do with the GTK plus stuff.
When you get into the, you're up inside of your own dependency problem.
Because it's a Pinobo stuff.
And I just can't, I mean, I don't know if I'm going to be able to work that out.
Is he coming here?
But I would love to have a better URL view.
None of which run anymore.
Oh, yeah, I just thought I was going to need a better one.
I think I did get the key for it.
I don't know, it's supposed to be better, but if anybody saw the code weaver was giving away,
what's it called?
I know it's designed for games.
But they have just like a commercial version of whatever it's called.
What's it called?

Now, they've decided I'm okay.
And now, for us, let's...
Don't worry about me.
I know you.
Don't worry about me.
I know you.
Don't worry about me.
I know you want to touch it.
touch it.
I know you want to touch it.
You can't touch it.
You say what we feeling to your side?
To your side, to your dragon steps...
This is hustle, imaginar.
You see?
I don't...
You can import the recipe directly to your weapon, so what we did to get all our old recipes
put into it is I just put all the recipes as HTML files on my new LAN, local LAN website
and I just, you know, we've taken an important part of that problem.
Yeah, it works very well.
I don't know what you're going to do, I don't know what you're going to do, I don't know
what you're going to do.
Is that an open-source restaurant or a lot of them?
Yes, you have to buy this open-source restaurant, you can tell it's open-source, you can try
a cherry.
Now I'm hoping there's an open-source restaurant in there, but you have to buy it.
And you bet that it can be modified for reasons?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

if he does have his way if he ends up in a rough race yeah yeah he did change the mind, he did change the mind, he did change the mind, he did change the mind, he did change the mind, he did change the mind, he did change the mind he did change the mind
I don't know what this is looking like, but it is version 4.4.6, and again, photos, so what kind of photos are in the camera?
2.4.
Yeah, you're right.
Open, and you're up to 2.6.
Okay, that's too small.
So, I'll fool around.
We don't get the information.
Just because there isn't one.
Okay, the ones they give you are just such a limiting set of shades or networks and things coming up.
Right, right.
Right, right.
This is just $1.
Why do you think it's something new?
So, what are the versions?
It means the deer can.
There's no blinding them.
Here's an idea for your Halloween costume.
Oh, is it a deer can?
I don't think so much.
No, you might take your kids out.
Oh, it is, okay.
Yeah, well, I didn't do too much with the drawings, but I managed to give a use paper out.
Oh, I was talking about this.
Why?
What is that for you?
Okay, that's the same thing for me.
I'm talking to my friends.
Did you solve the security problem yourself?
No.
I'm just glad we had a British security problem with the iPhone.
What was it like for?
You don't remember what?
What?
You don't get access to it.
You don't remember my family?
So that right?
Yeah.
I don't remember.
I didn't know that I was doing it.
You were doing it.
I was doing it with my dad.
You were doing it with your dad.
That was good.
Okay.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
Why did you put them?
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
Yeah, just to do your stuff.
Just to do some CG and everything.
Yeah.
Just to do your stuff.
I have to drive that.
Yep.
Works in the cities in Madison and Milwaukee.
Those are the closest places of 3G for AT&T's network.
My wife has the iPhone 3G and it's pretty cool.
And what?
I saw it.
What day was that?
What day was that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, according to the Spring people, they're predicting 3rd quarter of 2009.
All right.
Of the AT&T people, rather.
So, yeah.
Whether they'll actually get it done or not.
I don't know.
So, okay.
That's the signature of AT&T's network.
You got to get an M-player plug in for the output that outputs it as ASCII.
So, you can watch it.
Oh, that is cool, isn't it?
It's well-ferenced, so I suppose I can.
No, browser.
I'm kind of in the market for a different phone.
Is anyone using Sprint?
Yeah.
You guys don't buy enough stage.
Don't buy enough stage?
It's a little anyway.
I looked at the Blackberry series and I looked at the HTC Touch and the Touch Pro.
It's supposed to be coming on pretty soon and stuff.
And I have a palm trio right now.
I've just been sick of my phone.
So, I'd like to move to AT&T or a different carrier or something with a better phone.
But...
The iPhone Ripple.
iPhone Ripple?
Yeah, I hate to discourage it.
It's the same thing.
That's what it is.
Here's how we solve our Sprint phone problem.
It's what an Air Card modem will use to laptop it.
I know.
Okay.
Well, I'm still stuck in a contract till next September.
So, I'm looking for a better option in terms of the better usable phone.
Because I can't afford to just pay $500 to cancel it and get a new phone in a new network.
I'm really curious.
You can do it for the door of those companies out there.
Yeah.
I can't sign a contract.
Well, yeah.
If they force you to sign a contract, you just go someplace else.
Because not all of them will force you to sign a contract.
You just have to go all the way through all the proceeds.
So, it's...
All tell Mike the only Nazis as far as that goes.
They might be the ones that force you to sign a contract.
Do you know what?
Just go somebody else.
For the old cell phone sign.
Yeah, Verizon.
Some rumors could be coming pretty soon.
Oh, but all of a sudden.
Yeah.
It's an old cell to call my cell year one.
Since it's a digital cell year one, Verizon probably...
Let's say you want to take history with your phone.
To...
What is the G3 in all of them?
Nothing else in all of them.
It's really a fraud and fraud.
It's an entity cell.
It's...
It's...
It's a G3.
Is it the...
3G.
3G.
Is it the G7?
Yes.
Oh, it's dependent.
Yeah.
It's used as the HS...
The high speed data packet access.
It's the...
It's the new technology that will force packets through at a much faster rate.
Look, we were browsing on my wife's iPhone in the 3G network.
And it was fairly close to like a busy Wi-Fi network.
Like something you'd be like, we're all browsing here.
And so, you know, it's probably equivalent.
I mean, pages were loading pretty quickly.
And it seemed to pull information.
And YouTube came up in five seconds for a video.
So...
I mean, it was pretty good.
So...
I mean, pretty good for mobile networks.
Because we were driving, too.
It's a different technology.
Sprint.
Yeah, Sprint doesn't use...
They have CDMA.
They have...
I mean, they have their own version of the latest generation.
But according to the website,
I think it's like tops out at 1.4 megabit downloads
in like the perfect optimal environment.
So I'm talking like five bars right in the middle of town.
And their speed...
Their high speed network is in town with...
It is in our players.
But I don't have the people who are following me with like a higher speed,
people who are following me.
But I was...
I was at the Sprint store and I tried out a whole bunch of different phones.
And I wanted a good internet access.
I want a good email and good quality and everything.
And I wasn't really impressed with the speed.
It didn't seem any faster than like what the other devices were doing.
And the interface was like the biggest hurdle.
I don't really like the blackberry interface.
The very tiny little track hole is difficult to use.
And the track hole could...
Hardware...
Track the keyboard.
Blackboard.
Two, three.
Well, basically...
Yeah, the G1 with the internet.
Yeah, I mean, it looks like a very cool interface.
And as with the G1, I think it's T-Mobile.
It came out and everything.
It looks pretty cool.
I saw the demos and stuff.
Yeah, I don't see this at all.
Oh, you do?
Here?
Yeah?
Yeah, I work with it.
It's got an auto.
I use auto, but I'm using it.
I use it to auto.
And people use it.
It's got the GPS looping, fly fly, and data.
It's got a little...
Someone's getting a digital phone ring that'll turn us on.
How's the spectrum?
Where youode?
Everybody.
Hmm?
So...
So youadamente?
You know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
It's locked up.
I like...
I don't sell only these days.
I don't usually buyους, and actually just tries to free the stuff.
So, well, I don't forget to use the SS nosotros.
Essentially trying to...
To check this out,úniving the SS Audio.
Don't just say an auto.
Simply, the more resposta you have, the more...
reminded you quite extensively about just the tmectic.
That's absolutely way to write it anyway.
Right there, because I wasn't floored up.
Then I got my asses in my mouth.
And I got my asses in my mouth.
I got my asses in my mouth.
I was just trying to sit here.
I was just trying to sit here.
Oh, and I call them and they're wiped off the trash.
What did you tell them?
What did you tell them?
How did you get them in the weekend?
I read that, and I read that.
I read that, and I read that.
I read that, and I read that.
I was just trying to sit here.
He's just getting...
What's he?
Drought or a fat, and you just notice that...
I like that.
That's the one that I like.
That's the one that I like.
I like that.
That's the one that I like.
That's the one that I like.
You can't understand that.
You know, I hate the mistake of...
That's the use to get money out.
That's the use to get money out.
You're even now, but they kept track of that.
They got the little matches on the PC, you know, because she is a sticker, you know,
all over the body tree.
The G1, if you use Google for stuff, you don't want to take its kind of, I love the interface.
It's significant, you got it in your phone.
Yeah, I saw Google Calendar and Gmail, and it's pretty good.
It's got the Wi-Fi.
I thought it's definitely necessary to make a change, because he had the day I got calls
for my boss, and like three of the four calls from my boss didn't come to my phone.
I had like one missed call, and he's like, I called you four times.
Where were you?
I'm like, I would grab, now I'm going to be in trouble.
Yeah, start advertising for AT&T, my sprint phone sucks.
I lost my job because of Sprints.
You should use AT&T.
Yeah, that'd be fun.
Are you recording this?
Are you recording this?
Okay, and then just go on.
Yeah, just make sure you're recording this.
For quality control?
Yes, you can use this.
And what's security compromising tools?
Have you dumped on there that's going to install key loggers and everything along?
No, it's just a real simple script.
Deepy space.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Yeah.
We're handy to use if you could get the base, in the latest Ubuntu stable release,
release and then like add all the packages that you need in and then just do a
D.D. after you've got it plugged in to you know migrate the ISO, like month
ISO from the CD or from the file then you get it and then like do a D.D. from
there to the image of the device and as long as your file supports bootings
it will be pretty cool, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try,
I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try,
I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it
a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try,
I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try,
I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try, I am very curious, I'm not really sure what Hungarian is and what I'm thinking
He's got, I think, over a gig of stuff and he's got it all transcoded down, or a
terabyte of stuff, and it's all transcoded, so he's got hundreds and hundreds of
stuff. He's got a lot of it. He's got a lot of it. He's got a lot of it. He's got
pretty cool from him. He will take forever to download a
We give one of those to him and then he can fix y'all two or three trips, that's going to be a sneaker band.
Yeah, never underestimate the band width of a station wagon filled with floccigates.
There was some old saying, I think it was like from MIT or something.
I think it was like an experiment.
You know an experiment like that a while ago where there's some guy who build up his station wagon with hard drives.
He tested the usability of the fast and most efficient type of a nation.
You know, compared the total bandwidth of the pipe from one side of the nation to the other compared to the station wagon full of hard drives.
See how fast you can move that from one place to another.
Okay, I got the quote, it's from Andrew Tenenbaum.
Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of hard drives, hurling down the high wall.
What did they actually get with the station wagon for an average data rate?
That doesn't say it, that's just a quote.
I saw an interesting project if you're looking at a low cost bandwidth.
You can actually fit up to you.
They fit like 10 gigabytes of data on a single printing and a single sheet of paper.
Then you put more ease and recovery.
What?
Oh, that would show up in real life.
I was able to read all the data.
I was able to scan it.
Yeah, that's you.
Oh, shoot.
No, you're a cop.
I was staying here.
There goes 4 gig.
There's one other thing too with the kind of relates to the sneaker net.
I saw a joke online or a guy at work printed it out and gave it to me.
It was about avian carriers, like avian, like birds.
It's an IPO with avian carriers.
Yeah, and I was doing the search here and apparently Wikipedia says
that Lennox user group actually did it.
They sent nine packets over a distance of five kilometers using pigeons.
They actually did a ping with pigeons.
Did they have a photo?
I don't know what they did.
Did it make extensive data?
Is that like a dude's symmetrical unit?
It doesn't go into detail spots.
Where's it like they just like taped a little piece of paper that says ping?
And I'd be interested to take it towards lag.
It's like, oh, fire.
How do you add ropes to your pigeon?
Oh, there's a guy from my home search.
One thing you got to worry about is trying to hack it.
Yeah, watch out for the man's commerce or shotguns.
It could be a real damage to him.
Boom.
I guess that's a packet loss.
So that's it.
There's one more dumb story.
I got one today to handle advertising.
The printing company has a story.
It has a nice city and it's has all this.
Well, the principle of the story, the story of this is the name of the girl.
She's putting pieces on the arrow.
The pureness is the one in action.
And demonstrate how to clean it off the principle.
A lot of the girls go in and just, like,
with the special information of cleaning,
and even to a toilet floor,
and just slam the paper here,
so they don't have any issues anymore.
Girls in high school should be like that.
They don't even put anything in there.
Second.
Sheep.
Conversion.
The story was treated.
The episode is taken like a fan.
So I guess.
You can't ask, but, uh, can I?
Can I?
Too hot.
Just a little.
I'll start this interview.
Yeah.
Just a little.
Just a little.
Just a little.
Just a little.
We ain't much training, maybe.
Well, that's okay.
Just watch the judge.
I've been doing all these things.
I've been doing this for so long.
I've been doing it for so long.
I can't hear you anymore.
I've been doing it for so long.
You see the bar?
So, I'll be on a date for one, and then I'll say five or four, and this way we'll see how I should take out of it.
And somebody else would be able to do it.
Oh, it is.
I'm getting this.
We're all doing a lot of work.
We're going to be going to get a traditional dooderm.
We're going to do it.
Where is it?
I don't know if you go all the way.
Just like in my country.
Yeah, because there's quite some more of it better than what I'm saying.
It's the only two of them that I've seen.
But we have things that I'm going to do.
They were saying that they have a branch of boy's bank chains.
But they just finished the parking ran.
And so, everybody else, just the parking ran.
Now, I don't know if parking is parking.
I don't know if they were parking.
They're going to put on the high platform.
I don't know.
See, after this hunger was all been going on.
And because that's what not property, it's suspended.
Oh, they need to call it glass.
I'm not sure they will not.
So, they're going to add some more rooms.
They're going to update the events.
Because it's trying to make sure that there's a lot of holes in the basement.
So, they're going to explain what's going on in the basement.
Okay, here we go.
We're going to see a lot of people.
We're going to see a lot of people here.
A lot of people.
Because not me, me, a lot of people.
Not me.
Not me.
Not me at all.
Well, the loser actually was on the...
There was...
There was on the south side.
And the building is actually going to be a little bit good.
It's moving.
Yeah, they set off.
I don't know.
Hopefully, in 1905.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Good.
Here it is.
The I.X.
My feet.
I know you said the university actually used that on some of their lab stuff.
Well, yeah, that was not a mistake.
That was a good experience.
They're making a resonance.
That was donated by someone on the 18th.
Yeah.
I was going to do it.
Her crusade, you know, do a lot of clinic stuff.
We have a clinical variety.
All of our older stuff is mostly scope and a little bit of A.A.X.
But they've been slowly migrating scope over to Red Hat Enterprise 4.
And then the newest application is Windows XP Pearl with Server 2003 currently.
And they're in beta with the new Vista with Server 2008,
which we have to take training for now.
So let me tell you something.
It's obviously Windows 7.
They're doing whatever they're supposed to do.
So we are supposed to be touching the screen with our fingers.
There was a demo a while ago with that with a new Google API.
It had a working version where they had like a tabletop version.
And they were doing like giant like pinched like movements up and down,
the zoom in and zoom out and grab things and stuff.
And the guide that was running the demo that I saw,
it's probably on YouTube somewhere.
He was playing World Warcraft with it.
He was just saying, select this guy or, you know,
select this group of people here and like move over here,
and you attack him.
And I was using the interface like that.
It was just, it was a regular white table,
but it was some sort of special projector that could send sensors.
There's three infrared cameras that detect the surface.
So it's anything similar to that is where you're touching.
But you have to have three of these infrared sensors,
like precisely.
Well, that's one way of doing it.
The other way is what they'll have is they'll have a piece of glass
and they'll have infrared lights along the sides of the glass.
And the infrared light will bounce in the glass.
And when you touch it,
it changes the reflection of the glass.
So it'll actually light up.
And then behind that, they'll have a camera.
They'll pick up only that certain frequency of infrared.
So then they can pick up different touches based on that.
I was talking about touch surface.
I touched surface.
Yeah.
You're talking about the surface.
The demo that I saw was like it was a flat surface
and they were playing a game.
It was a 2D surface.
It wasn't like he was like reaching his hands with open space.
And then he said,
you're touching the monitor.
So you're touching the keyboard.
You're touching the monitor.
You don't think they're enough with that.
With the camera behind,
you can make an extremely simple version of that.
What you can do is you get a piece of like,
like the glass, you get the lights,
get a V-remote.
The V-remote is actually a Bluetooth device.
And it's unencrypted.
And it has the hardware to do that.
It's got infrared cameras.
You can see you can plug that into your computer
and then have that, you know, as your camera.
And then it will actually pick up your fingers touching it.
And you can turn that into a multi-touch device instead of $10,000
or whatever the Microsoft wants for it.
There's four different methods to do it.
There's ultrasonic where it will actually
have like real piezo buzzers.
And when you touch it, it'll change like the waveform.
There's capacitance where it'll actually like a touch lamp.
Similar to that.
I think there's like a mechanical one as well.
We'll pick that up.
And there's one other one.
I think it's like some type of interference pattern
with light.
Like it'll actually, as you're touching it,
it has almost like a laser that shines right in front of it.
And it'll pick up where your finger intersects that.
So there's a bunch of different ways to do it.
I'm looking at a bunch of different things.
How about you, Elliot?
I'm going to take you.
Like I was talking about earlier, helping my friend
with what I've only two on his laptop.
Basically to try and use it as a media,
with one media player for media packs.
Just to eat and help bring over S video to his TV so you can watch it.
So that didn't go as the second one.
I couldn't get wireless networking working.
I had problems with the end of display working properly.
I ended up having to use a higher resolution
than I wanted to.
It's hard to control it.
And like I said, the refresh rate is kind of large.
I might end up going back to X-Feed,
just because it doesn't do what you want to do.
Middora, maybe?
Awesome.
Yeah, he doesn't have it.
He doesn't have it.
I should do that.
Because the mid-CV has the display for TVs.
It does everything for you.
I wonder if middora is better.
It's not really.
When you talk about middora,
middora 10, even when there was the V-switch,
the virtual display from the default control of F7 to F1.
It's F1 that displays X.
That's graphics now?
Yeah.
Okay.
That would be very confusing.
Yeah, it's not people who are very upset about it.
It has to have any protection?
Yes.
Okay.
Then F, whatever.
The claim to a thing was that it was much faster
than the virtual terminal of this first terminal.
Maybe it was starting out.
That was the...
And I know one thing that they're actually working on
is...
I can't remember exactly what it's called,
but where the X-Mode can be switched,
like, almost...
Almost X switching or whatever it was called.
I can't remember what it was named.
Where it can start up X at a certain resolution
and keep that throughout the entire boot sequence.
So you're not getting all the goofy flickering and all that.
As soon as the kernel boots,
there you go.
You're in X.
You're in X.
So I don't know if he's going to stay there,
but that's what I read.
It's not people who...
They can put up with it.
I'd bring a desktop in soon.
Can figure it.
Could we have, like, an install week or something?
Like, we've got a regular desktop that...
Right now, the process is overheating
because I don't think it has a clean-up heat sink.
And just because of the way that the case is designed
with the fan for the CPU doesn't exactly line up.
I mean, it's closed,
but it's not exactly lined up to the whole or the thing.
So I'm having heating issues,
and I get over that.
Can we do, like, um...
on this Ubuntu or a new...
This door...
This door...
This door...
A installer.
There's a trial run and stuff.
No, it's an app on X.
It's an app on X.
It's a fairly hot running generation of processes and stuff.
Those things run at about 90 degrees C natively.
Yeah.
I used to have a 2400 and that was...
Yeah, that was the idea.
Oh, yeah.
It started out as a vanity.
I've been looking for...
In Boyle Vega, that thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The problem I keep running into now is that...
I'll use the machine for about 30 seconds,
and then the alarm will start kicking off
because it's like the wind up.
Oh, well, you definitely need something like a...
a V-on there.
The reason the processor...
I mean, the load on my processor,
I've got a dual dual cord,
and the load is actually up around 60% average.
So it just kills the processor.
I know what it does.
I might end up having to get a new board and a new chip and everything,
and I'd like to get a good low voltage, low heat source one.
And I was looking at a few videos on YouTube about
there's certain boards and processors that have a heat sink
that's about four or five inches tall,
and it's efficient enough that it doesn't actually need a fan at all.
So it's like, you know, you don't need any fans in the system whatsoever,
just because it's low voltage enough,
and it's low heat enough,
but it can just dissipate enough with the open air.
And, you know, it'd be nice to get something like that.
I don't know what generation the processor I can remember,
but it'd be nice to do something like that,
and then just use the peripherals that I have already,
like the D&E burner in there.
Do you have like a TV tumor card or anything?
I don't know how it should be, I think.
Okay.
Perfect.
There you go.
And that comes with the remote, right?
Yeah.
So there you go.
So the hardware I have for that is just been having food issues,
and so like I work on it every so often,
and then it'll fail, and it's like a lot harder.
I can't really afford to go buying any chip and stuff right now,
so I, you know, try to baby this alone.
And what I've got, I've got the 150,
and then I've also got one of these in there,
or the HTC ones.
Yeah.
So you can capture the cable company has to send
all of the high-def stations over the wire unencrypted.
So any of the networks I can get to high-def and record.
So if you have a standard subscription,
you can pick up the signal with that,
because it's not encrypted,
and then there's one thing.
Yes, you have anything that you can pick up over the air,
high-def, the cable company has to offer it
over their system unencrypted, if they offer it.
So like NBC, I can pick up NBC and high-def over the air.
So if they offer high-def NBC anywhere,
they have to send it unencrypted,
so I can get high-def NBC over the regular cable.
So they, does it work?
Does it work?
Is that an HD subscription?
No, no.
We have a basic, like the $10 cable.
Yeah.
Just like those $15 channels.
Yep, we got PBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox.
And high-def.
And stuff to shop at.
Did it?
Did it?
There's a pixelate pretty often,
or is it pretty good in terms of...
Oh, you got stuff.
I have really had any complaints with the signal.
I've been able to water two glitches all the time.
I had a friend who just bought a new HDTV,
and he was using it all over the air.
He turned it off by the time he came in,
until he was on a mattress.
That was absolutely great.
That was pretty pixelated.
The thing about it ain't rate in town,
or close to O'Claire.
TV 13 just completely wipes everything else off the map.
But then you can't pick up TV 13
because the signal's too strong,
and you get all these weird echoes.
So TV 13 absolutely won't come in.
Yeah.
That's a really, really good antenna.
TV 18.
TV 13 doesn't come in.
It will not come in in town,
because the signal is too strong,
and you get reflections.
I can pick it up.
I can pick it up.
It must be exactly where we are.
We're getting a reflection or something,
because it's really close to, like,
by KFC.
I mean, because that's what I'm 93 or 94.
Oh, well, that's closer to TV 18.
It's cool.
Yeah, but there's a hill between us and TV 18,
so we don't get it in person.
I think it'd be far enough away
that you'd be out of, like, a simulation.
Or, like, the bandwidth like that,
and then, you can come in and come in.
We didn't so, but we absolutely couldn't
go TV 13 either.
But it works with the cable.
It's for real.
It's just a digital, I mean,
it's a signal on a copper line regardless of, you know,
I wouldn't think you'd have as much degradation of signals
coming through.
It just, it's not like it's an OK broadcast,
or it's just a separate device.
It's an interference from anybody that's searched,
that to all their other signal levels,
they thought the cable weren't about 90,
you know, 93%.
So they're all good at locks.
It's a project that I've had sitting out there for like the longest time, never been, and I've been
like so close to being able to get a lot better in the way that we're trying to do that, and we're going to be like a self-installed version of it, and we're running into hardware issues and stuff, and that's been like the biggest hurdle to get over it, so I need to find like a good solution for it,
there's a way that we're getting out too out there, and we're like, I'm going to ask for one of our sites, because hardware recommendations are big, low power, low power.
I've got a low power app on it, which is really well. For the low one, I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a high power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low
power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it,
and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power app on it, and I've got a low power appнуюal power app on it,
and that's the highlight of that voice-test, the highlight of that voice-test, it's the highlight of that voice-test,
They're propagating, they're actually increasing their signal strength by feeding off of each other.
So you're sending multiple inputs and multiple outputs at the same.
And there have been tests where people have theoretically gotten better than 200 meters per second on the virus, which is pretty cool.
So it's a good theory, but you know, there's a lot of limitations in the virus.
So basically, the switch has to be a little better than your baby's has to be to get anything.
And then it's faster than that through the virus.
It's still switching around.
It's a good theory, and it gets it to the point where like, that was half duplex.
So like, you're talking about a full duplex implementation being made of 100 megabits,
which is near the max of what a wired button most of the wired people have at home.
But the problem is, it's not that connection that becomes the issue.
Because now only they're trying to support full duplex 100 megabits on the Wi-Fi connection,
but then you have to have a backup for the support to keep the rest of the router grid.
So like you guys, you know, if you've got, you know, 82.11, able to get 25 laptops that are browsing out there at 100 megabits,
you have to have the backbone infrastructure.
You're going to have to have a minimum of one gigabits per port from switch to switch,
or from router to router to be able to effectively use that much bandwidth back and forth to utilize it.
So it's, you know, it's a good theory for like small businesses and stuff.
Everything of what I've read has been a challenge in the enterprise because the infrastructure just doesn't support right now.
And it'll probably be a couple of years before people can really upgrade to support it.
I mean, yeah, because I mean, you have to have to have like gig speeds, you need gigabit for just from end to end.
If there's any point of the length there that's 100 megabit, that's the speed you run it.
So if you're running, you know, if you're connected to even a gigabit port,
you have 25 people surfing.
Yeah, and speed.
The train goes only as fast as it's slow as time.
Yeah.
Well, your question is, we can do it, you know.
If you come, you know, reach up front and say, well, can you do it next week?
It's a good thing.
We're good people.
We're good people.
We take your cooking line up with the people who are going for us.
Yeah.
We just think if we get a hook it up to the projector, maybe, and I don't have Wi-Fi in there though.
Can we, do we have cat pie here?
Or are we going to have a cat pie to do this?
They don't have Wi-Fi to do this.
No, I don't do Wi-Fi.
But I see nothing have Wi-Fi here.
I don't know if it's going to be a Wi-Fi or a USB.
Is that going to be a USB?
No, it's going to be a Wi-Fi.
It's going to be a USB.
Why don't you have Wi-Fi?
It's a desktop machine.
It's just for the motor niezza matter.
istiyorum, the zombies vibe.
Yeah, exactly.
It's environment for器 and brought us along, so we could stick it to the USB port he has
or we could do it that way.
For their quick fix to be assuming that theți-
Two Might've gotten one that spoke lots to you.
Well, it is violence as hell with that one.
Ah, somebody can just set up IP masquerading on their PC.
It's just a few simple commands.
It'd be a resource!
Absolutely.
Yeah, no, I have almost 10, all it is is the check internet connection, Sherry.
See, it's just got, it's just the script that types in all the bands, it's boring.
It's probably just as simple to make the changes.
It's just easy.
Yeah, it's great.
We appreciate it.
So what's the name of the song?
C'mon, 2, 3.
C'mon, is it?
Whatever, it's too complicated.
Actually, they're broken.
I didn't turn out.
I've been pleasantly surprised with Madness X.
Madness X, getting to the overly simplistic thing.
So, I'm going to go on a newsletter.
Just put a little order in this.
Yeah, I'll suppose today.
Aha, I'm going to go on a newsletter.
Have you seen the new record box?
Have you seen it?
Today was a good one.
I was going to do it today.
No, no, one for.
So I kind of had a pressure to download.
How do you play it?
How do you play it?
3 and a half.
There's a whole band.
And the whole band is glass.
What do you like to have?
10 times.
And deleted them.
Oh, the whole thing clicks down.
What do you do?
Okay, it's like a suit life,
because I can stand a like 10 times.
No, I always suit that.
I always put a band into something.
I always put it on a random style.
It's videos that I have to look at.
Yeah, there was something about that.
It was great.
I'm very proud of it.
That was very good.
Oh, I heard it.
It's a good news.
I'm very proud.
Oh.
It's good news.
It's good news.
Because anybody downloaded Ubuntu.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Do you want to have a copy?
No, I have a copy.
I'm downloading it.
You have that one right now.
Is this stuff?
And I'll get you a copy.
All right.
Just because I'm nice to have you.
Because you're chewing up all of our bandwidth.
Come on.
Yeah, that's what he really wants.
Nice.
It's so short.
Do you have it on this?
No, I don't have it on this.
I think you have to have it on this.
I think you have to have it on this.
You have to have it on this.
You have to have it on this.
Yeah, but it's full of it.
Yeah, it's full of it.
Yeah, it's full of it.
All right.
Well, how many is this?
Four, eight.
More?
Yeah.
Here.
Yeah.
Yeah, but oh, why so?
So they actually might need to be.
You have a few articles, whatever it is.
They're misspelled all the voice data.
I use letter.
Philosophy features.
You have to get it.
There was something in March.
I don't know.
Here, use one of these cheapy cases and giving my good one back.
Oh, right.
I'm taking it with the beer.
There was something in a secret foundation that picked EPL.
That is the books.
One more license.
So if somebody is interested in that.
The first part of the license is what it looks as usually.
I guess the same as the GPL, but not.
It's not compatible.
I think there's more.
You can use it.
I think there's a.
It's weird.
You don't have to put anything back.
You can use it.
You can use it.
You can download it.
It's only two and a half gigabytes.
Which source?
Yes, which source?
Yes.
It compatible with Android.
I don't know.
I don't know.
There was a lot of Google's and Android's in the future.
So what you can do, you can have it.
Thank you.
You can have people who want to see your applications.
So what do you do?
That's pretty good.
I think you can do it.
It's a pretty good model that would compete with the simulator for the iPhone.
I was one of the big boys for the developers.
Then you got a simulator of the iPhone right on the desktop,
the one with the device for debugging and troubleshooting and everything.
This would be a good competitor.
It has been for a lot of different PDAs and stuff for quite a while.
Yeah, like back in the day, the phones and everything had full emulation on the software.
It's the latest one that we've ever seen before.
It doesn't matter.
They actually don't have it for like a bit of microcontrollers.
Well, that makes sense.
What do you want?
I have a high level option from the long team.
You don't have 64.
I'm down one in 64.
It is PDAs.
Well, here I give you a CDR review.
It's 4.2.
It's all here.
I'm man, what else am I in there?
Money, PDAs.
You don't do a CDR review just for that.
So just want to pass it up on you.
Did you read it?
No.
Okay, it's 30.
It's 30.
It's 30.
It's 30.
It's 30.
Okay.
Okay.
I can find the nearest one.
It doesn't want to stop when the banner is off.
Well, it is cute.
Less Canadian.
Here I'll trade you.
I mean, that like, it was a fun thing.
Notice that it's faster.
It's pre-comp paved.
So your system is switching.
It's better battery life.
Less Canadian stuff?
No, no.
And the Lebanese go down.
It was there, Class...
Your screw.
You should prioritize it.
I've got the password in it.
Yeah, I know you're good.
And turn down your street pranks.
Right, just get out of here.
There was something about the ball games,
athletics, for work hits.
So they're talking about it.
Did you get that?
No, I didn't get that.
I kind of read through that.
Hey, just go to HappyPanguin.org.
And go through all their stuff.
They've got like a whole bunch of Linux games.
That's, I just pretty much go there every,
maybe once, every two weeks or so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, work.
Can you, can you, can you,
I think I can't repeat.
Is that bootable?
This is bootable.
It should be.
What does it, what product does it offer?
So we're playing it slow right.
It's also running.
We're...
It'll use what?
It just wants 64 minutes.
I'm at his.
It's a month.
Yeah.
It's one and get.
I want to win that
because I have over four D2 board as well.
It has over 2,000 games out.
So for Linux.
It's all about the neighbor, but how do they do that next year?
They can't apply it to the home again, so there was some better finding things.
I think that's a little bit.
So, you know, the community.
I think it's the actual job.
That's pretty slick.
Did you look at it at all?
I think that it's one point, not this time, but it's one point.
It looks like GCK.
So, you've thought of years of easy experience.
You're gonna have to tell me what I'm for.
That is available on the Linux, the BSE, and the rest of that.
Amiga, wow!
That's what it was developed on.
You know, something interesting, we were kind of talking about phones.
Opera's got a version that runs an opera that actually runs on the iPhone,
and Apple won't let them release it.
Because it competes with Safari.
There's been a couple of technologies like that.
Flash is a big, big complaint about the iPhone is because they don't allow any native flash on the iPhone.
I think it used to be that you had got to license it, that license flash, from corporate devices.
And right now, they don't have to allow to name an iPhone, so I don't know why.
I think it's because it would open up to many other possibilities.
Like, there's services like Hulu and other streaming services that would compete with their iTunes downloading models.
So, there wouldn't be downloading TV shows in more ways for iTunes than they would be.
They're on the screen.
I don't know.
I mean, that's a real limitation.
I mean, that's the same thing with that Android.
Yeah.
Yeah, except the Android doesn't have the same screen.
Well, the one phone doesn't, but I mean, Android's just a platform.
Any device with any resolution will open up.
Although, I must say, I've been having watched it for years.
And I mean, it is.
You've had me as much space to scroll back into the world.
I think it's kind of, yeah.
So, it's really, it's so easy to switch back and forth.
You have to go back to your space.
Well, for that application, this week, we have a list of Ms. Lim.
I have a list of Ms. Ferrer.
I want to go back and be.
I'm not going to use that.
I do that for my age.
I just want to take a look at what you have in that.
Under that can be.
It's an excellent study, and it's so trying.
There was some application about our data work.
I thought they'd try to get it out of the way.
And it's just trying to help the rest of the people.
So, I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
There's a package that came out a while ago that's like a time machine
equivalent program in a bunch of them.
I'm doing like an income amount.
I am trying to.
I don't have a lot of calls from the search.
There's a couple of Python scripts.
I don't think that's all of them.
I don't think that's all of them.
I don't think that's all of them.
I don't think that's all of them.
I don't think that's all of them.
I don't think that's all of them.
Yeah, time vault.
Simple front end for me on snapshots on the set of directories.
It is being tried.
I'm not going to use that.
I'm not going to use that.
Well, I'm not going to use those.
I might need coins.
Oh, yeah.
I can't play around with Mom.
I'll do my part because if you'll see it, if you'll see me on the next one gonna be the
Maybe, I be able to see them.
That's a waste...
Sau لهui is by the version of Birch Hospital.
Why is that called kind of New York community?
Oh, that one.
That one.
I don't know. It might be. If it says this in our W, it's probably in our W.
It doesn't say our W. Then it's probably not in our W.
Can't argue with that logic. Cause there wasn't any.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

don't know.
You guys will be there for the Army to part with you in five months.
You change the way the program is making sure your program is working.
Yeah, it's really good.
It's not that we ask you to do it.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
It's a part of the way.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
This is HOLEE from Zolvar.
You always get time, you always get time.
You always get time, you always get time, you always get time.
Yo!
Yo!
Yeah, I don't know. It's something you said reminded me.
You want to hear more about it?
I see it's mostly, are you expecting it a lot?
I am.
It do is.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
That was the thing.
Oh.
That's it.
Oh.
Oh.
Take me back.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
It's not a busy day for you.
Can you put your eyes on it?
Are you going to do it?
No.
No.
No.
Okay.
I'm going to say something about that.
Yes, please.
That's actually using something called a screen scraper.
Okay.
So it's going to the website and it's parsing HTML and stealing
information on the site.
Well, the quality of that is in question.
So what do you think you're good?
Well, the site, you know, they're making their money off the ads.
So you doing that is going up as their ads and it's actually running a script.
It's hacking their website.
So you could technically be charged with hacking their website by doing that.
Was that?
When I saw this, was that?
Exactly.
Exactly.
I know.
It's a free service.
They don't know on or off of the free service.
Yeah.
You have to use Schedules Direct and your paper.
Anyway.
And I'm going to use some sort of illegal mail or you're watching.
There must be some sort of implementation of links to grab the data.
You know, it's text-based browser.
It's actually the old WGate.
I looked at the script that you use WGate and parsing the screen.
And that'll work.
I mean, that'll be great.
And that's the next slide.
If you fall asleep during your TV show, you'll be slammed into jail.
There's an upload of different things for like a new TV.
And actually, it's going to be like a fun performance.
I got one of the plans for our own sets of web sites.
It'll get all of the times of like movies or movies.
So it's also like a website.
It looks at our website.
Grads already came out and parsed it out.
And then it gets, you know, gets the results in certain formats.
And that's the place for it.
I guess that's probably what I'm going to do with it.
Because there are a lot of things that I don't like the biggest ones.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for listening to Half the Public Radio.
HPR is sponsored by Carol.net.
She'll head on over to see ARO.NC for all of her TV.
Thanks for watching.
