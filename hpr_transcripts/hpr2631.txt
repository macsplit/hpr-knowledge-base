My name is Ken Fallon and you're welcome to another episode of Hacker Public Radio. This
is HBR Community News for August 2018 and monthly look at what's been going on in the HBR
community. This is a regular show scheduled for the first Monday of the month recorded
two days prior to that. Joining me this evening is Hi it's Dave Morris. Hi Dave and we also
have Yerun who is one of our new hosts and I think he's all having dinner at the minute but
may join us later on. For those of you new tickets are you there? Yeah yeah yeah I am. I'm done
eating and I'm ready to listen and join in whenever needed. Excellent. First of all let us welcome
our new hosts and that is traditionally done by David. David will you welcome our new host?
We have one new host this month and it is extra to extra to I believe. You would not
know who that is Yerun. I have no clue. Anyways HBR Community News is a community podcast
network where the shows are contributed by the listeners like yourself. We're listening to this.
We do a community news show every month so that people can basically review what's been going on
in the community. We normally start by going through the shows that have been on in the last
month and then talking about the comments. Yerun I don't know if you want to get to your business
first or do you want to sit through the show? Well I was invited to join and talk about some stuff
so I can do that. I can wait for it. I'm in a hurry. It's up to you. You're the host in a way.
Yeah shall we do that first Dave? And then we can go on with the rest of the show afterwards.
Yeah yeah sounds good to me. So Yerun are Yerun which one? For once I got a host name that
I could pronounce and you didn't pronounce it like it's pronounced in the Netherlands. I think
it anglicizes it on your but you're extra one anyway. Mede comment. I think Dave can you
basically sum up what the story is? Well I met Yerun at Ogham where he gave an excellent
presentation and it was actually JWP who was speaking to him about Agapublic Radio and I joined in.
Handed it over a business card and said if you feel like doing a show then here's where to do it
and within a pretty short space of time after Ogham was over he very very kindly did that very
thing. Having so the show is posted for 7th of September and Yerun has listened to it today.
I've pointed out where it was and he had some comments about the the packaging I guess the
the the branding the branding yes yes so there was a little bit of a conversation on the Ogham
channel of telegram so I don't know whether you want to comment on your feelings on this subject
Yerun yourself? Well it's not so much feelings as it is let's call it mild surprise. I was expecting
some editing in a way so when I started I wasn't in no hurry to listen to myself that I'm not
that kind of guy but I was curious and so if I remember correctly it starts with an East Peak
intro which is of course very good for people who are for instance a vision impaired to to gather
what what the subject is all about after that there was a sort of commercial and even that one I
can understand and after that there was some sort of yeah I guess it's the tune of the
probably the radio and yeah yeah yeah exactly and I made some comments about that I guess I've
had my own video for a long period of time so I made those kind of tunes myself 30 years ago and
recently I was looking for a tune to stop my own podcast thinking well I also because I also at
one point had a radio show at local radio in the Netherlands and so I was a bit familiar with
tunes and and and jingles so I was I was looking around for for a nice tune and I was actually
astounded by the quality of tunes available and picked one to start my podcast with so when I
listened to the podcast today before my tune was another tune inserted which was different let's
put the vitally like that and and I I don't want to step on anybody's feelings and in any way and
I do think a time by itself is a valuable thing so time spent by people doing podcasts or working
on open source is is a valuable gift to to consider a such but it's the the you know the website is
professional the the how do you say the the the things that are mentioned there to get a
podcast online are clear concise helpful etc so you get a certain expectation of the professionalism
of the organization that was a business card that also builds expectations so when suddenly in
the midst of all the intro sounds there is a tune that I could have produced myself and and
that surprised me let's put it like that and and and so and that's what I mentioned on the
webcam channel in that that's basically how I ended up here okay so basically I think your
position is kind of unique in so far as the expectations may be a little bit different from HPR
you're coming to this completely new and you've been basically a plus word volunteered
into into the network so you're coming to the network as a completely new set of years so I
really think it's important that we've had you on to discuss this now just to give you some
background HPR is slightly different to your normal shows when you say this theme sounds really old
it is because the theme is really old it's nearly 13 years old now in which it's quite long
in internet terms and prior to that we had a another team with when we had today with it techy
there have been a few attempts to change it over the years and in each case it's been pretty much
rejected on the grounds that it's branding I'm just telling I'm just communicating this is not
me stating anything here this is me bringing everybody including you're ruined but also including
new members of the community up to date and it's also a chance for us to remind everybody that we
as a community decide what's going to happen or what doesn't happen so there have been
various different discussions on what to do with branding first of all they if you go to the
give shows section and you go to themes you'll get a breakdown of the theme music and there was
a link there to the discussions forum which is disappeared we'll try and get that link back up
so the first part is the show synopsis which is this is HDR episodes this is the e-speak thing
and just before Ray and the guys contact us the people in the who rely on e-speak
absolutely hate this because it is so in the vision and parry community they actually don't
like this at all because they have their own means of I'm generalizing here there may be different
what the feedback that I've received has been that they dislike this because they automatically
do their own thing on their own shows so this is actually for more for people who don't want to
look at their media players something like and then can immediately tell what the show is so that
they can decide to skip it or not so it tells you what it is sure some some read the show and you
can skip it and given we have five shows a week 266 shows a year and terabytes of shows in the few
this has been about 50-50 about people who wanted and people who don't want it the following one
the next component of the theme is thanking our hosting provider so if you're listening to this
from the website you'll get a thank you for anonymous holes.com and if we if you listen to
it from archive.org you get it from archive.org there was some debate we definitely do want to
have that in but whether we have it at the beginning or the end of the podcast that is something
that has been debated and again it was 50-50. The HBR introductory music one as I said was up for
discussion previously and there was even talkable tournament one but there was the general decision
was made and this was white at the time pro keeping the music as it is because it has a lot of
branding and in the podcast community it has it has a noticeable branding for what HBR is and
this is HBR if you listen to podcasts and you're then you know that it's a HBR theme then we
have the show and then we have the outro and you can have any HBR in themed show this was the
compromise and there's been a few submitted over at the time provided that the text is given
as we agreed which is you are listening to archipelago videos community podcast network blah blah blah so
that text needs to be written out and a lot of people a few people have met their own versions of
the themes and they're up and then finally there's an epilogue which is basically for polky
and promos which we have not yet added so what I want to do is take that this is an opportunity
again to revisit this discussion I don't intend to propose any solution here now what I did do
intend to do is bring it up on the HBR mailing list and we would like as always to hear your thoughts
about this do we modify the HBR intro music I think that's the Duke everything again is up for
grabs guys because it's been a good while since we've had this discussion and it's I think it's
time for it to be had again do we put this show synopsis in do we thank our host and we will be
thanking our host and providers I just think it's rude not to that's my personal opinion well the
question is there do we thank them and if so what's the order of these sorts of things so I'll put
the link into the to this page and start a topic on the mailing list and that will be that sounds
fair enough yeah well if I can add just two cents to it so I understand the branding point of
of a tune but if I for instance look at well let's say in a example dodge the television there is
a news broadcast every evening it's a very recognizable tune but even that one is is revisited
and changed every I don't know five years or so and I can imagine that you make a
for instance maybe not change the tune if that's a bridge too far but re re-manage it we arrange it
is the word sorry rearrange it to to to to make it sound more more modern and more to today's then
the one that I heard today so it would still be recognizable but it would sound well there I say
a little more professional super and now this is where everybody listening knowing me will volunteer
you to produce to produce that very thing not just you but if there are anybody if there's
anybody out there who can re-imagine the the intro theme to give people because that will make
that I'm absolutely for I personally am absolutely fine with but then again I have as much say
as anybody else just as a reminder as a host I think that would be cool and it would be nice to
if it's not a lot of work but if somebody could slap something together and see if that
would be acceptable to the community is there a media file available of the of this tune no it's
again I wasn't involved back then I think it was slick zero did it I'll try and get in touch
with him but all I have is the flag file of the thing if that's so no media file is there is
and no score then no although I do happen to know somebody who listens to the network
in Lafayette Louisiana who may have a score what do you reckon Dave I was just laughing
off I'll sleep like yeah yes yes no no no no if we did have somebody who is professionally
connected in the music world then head of a department of music indeed yes if there was such a
person then he might be somebody who could contribute so actually that would that would be cool to
have anyway that would be cool to have anyway and I'll get in touch with slick zero as well and
yeah if there were if there are basically let's assume that they that we could have people
who would be willing to do re you know refreshing refresh of the HDR intro music like that
that keep in keeping the spurs of that alive and stuff so there is recognizable branding
then we can have that discussion we're going to have that discussion anywhere on the list
yeah I mean if there was a media file you have a community of a lot of people who are active
with audio in a way if there was a media file everybody could get started very easily to arrange
it on their own and you could even make a sort of well it what's the word for it
competition collaboration no no sort of a game of people submitting entries and voting on
which one is the most appreciated yeah fair enough yeah good but that's what the mailing list is
essentially it's whoever basically whichever way they they tend to go with my experiences that
some people will love one thing and hate the other ones but yeah regardless it's cool again
you know if people step up and do it that would be absolutely awesome and there's always the option
to rotate them or have the host decide when you upload you show which one you'd like
okay shall we move on we'll be here all nice okay cool so let us look at last month's shows have
you ever have you listened to any of the HBR shows yes me so far no I today I'm currently on
on vacation and so I was curious and just listen to the first minutes of my own podcast and
devil basically it so far and after that I listen to another podcast from a completely
different source just to get a sort of a feel so I'm a real podcast virgin in a way
I love to do talks I do them all the time so I've got by now a lot of content and subjects that
I could turn into podcasts and just just getting my feel for what the world of podcasts is all
about cool can I recommend also that you go to the HBR if you go to the HBR website and you go
to get shows we have in-depth series and there's a section they're called podcast recommendations
where we recommend other podcasts not just Linux ones but you know wide range of different
you know what the other listeners have in their podcast client in the last one it's my Swedish
and German podcast so have a have a read the last and we'll definitely give you something something
to browse it's a good idea thanks no problem um yeah that's actually nice too I would appreciate
your feedback as well positive and negative on what we're doing here because it's it's rare that
we get somebody who's untainted coming to the network untainted in the best possible way so as I
said before what we do is we tend to go through the last shows that've been on in the last month
and I we've heard recently we've heard we suspected and we've heard that people listen to this show
and then listen to our discussions of the previous months shows to go back and pick it out because
as I said we do have an awful lot of shows on the network and some months uh it can be the shows
can be two or three hours long on average and then some months it can go down to five or six minutes
because we don't have any limitation on how long the show can be or um the content of said show
outside the intro and outro and we know your feelings on that so the first show was battle tech
by and I'm going to read it to go Toronto who Dave did you notice allowed us to simplify that
indeed indeed yes um to new readers um we've been having a slight uh
bottle I'll say discussion discussion friendly friendly discussion exchange of views
about how to how to say his his handle um but yeah um I'm conceding the point to to Ken at the
moment yes and uh two people new to the network uh it's a long tradition where I butcher people's names
so uh if your name has not been butchered then uh then you're not a real real HBR contributor
and if I haven't butchered your name yet I eventually will so this was a game about uh this is in
the tabletop gaming um uh series that we do and it was a show about um battle uh tech which is a
science fiction space up here friction rely fictional militarized universe set in the 31st century
where a few a future where humanity has spread to the stars etc etc etc what do you think Dave
well it sounds it sounds very very uh detailed and impressive I I'm not showing my my small brain is
up up on that type of thing but it's certainly certainly sound impressive and CM Hobbs thoughts or
two hurrah battle tech I haven't listened to the podcast yes but I have a cute up from my morning
walk I hope you mentioned mega mech and mech wars as another BTEC fan it's about the only way I can
play these days because it's hard to get a tabletop game together sometimes and uh to turtle as
I tend to call him uh replies mega mech and mech mech wars mega mech and mech wars are completely
forgotten as I was I was too excited to talk about the game truth be told there's so much to tell
about the game that it's almost impossible to fit all of it in one episode even in a very
very superficial level I like the fact I like the way he is contributing his shows he's bringing
lots of interesting stuff he's good yeah quite a variety isn't it long may I continue
tattoo just uh demonstrates sparkle share and uh because claque uh a host whose name that butchered
in many occasion uh that not everybody might know about sparkle share and I think it is such an
awesome thing yes I can think of a reason why I would use it but I think it's such an awesome thing
yeah yeah I know I I feel very tempted to use it I've installed it but I haven't seemed to have
had any time this past month to do do do anything with it but uh ditto as far as usage is concerned but
I think it's just lack of imagination on my part for everybody exactly well on my part I mean
obviously not yours but claque says thank you xn show as always what sparkle share is and how to
use it at different expert levels and when not in when not use it at all is a thoroughly explained
without the uh decide ever doing ever feeling no episode ever feeling no oh my god dude so
somebody spelled up past you I don't correct I don't correct for me I don't correct people's
comments that would just be too big brotherish I feel hmm okay most well thank you for playing
off my episodes paying off my episode debt to the community for me I guess I owe you personally
an episode now it's dead yes another episode right uh the following day uh same old this guy
coming up with a bloody gnu arc part 12 uh when will he stop I don't know okay no comments people
people are obviously sick and tired of hearing this well I did get one comment did you know
that was that was from uh friend JWP who said Dave it's really interesting but it's a bit long
so I said oh well thanks JWP that's very supportive of you fair that in mind but you know
it's a it's a valid comment it's a valid comment I sometimes were wonder about that myself
now it is um as day as plateau has basically turned his own gnu world order another podcast you
should listen to if you're want to listen to well-produced shows uh yearune is a gnu world order you
will find a link to it in on the podcast recommendations for sure and it's by one of our fellow hosts
plateau or not plateau depending but only in this episode Dave you were talking about sorting a
phrase which I found invaluable not only because of arc but your references also to how they're
handled in bash so yeah very right okay and I do I do approach this show and this is why I like
the intro um because this one I'll skip over until I'm in a place where I can I really need to be
in the zone to to get this one to do these results and not just yours ones but also when BZ does his
yes I do write these in the assumption that people are gonna look at it maybe and then skip and then
maybe come back if they feel it's useful and also look at the long notes as sort of a a chapter
out of a book sort of idea so yeah I think I mean my my approach to this to this show at least is
to this entire series which is absolutely excellent is that you will at some point
um be producing an e-pub of the whole thing I don't know you produce e-pub of the notes and uh
some sort of audio CD with it so that that I would envision you know being on a hp or stand as a
like a promo book sort of thing yep that's sort of though I have in mind okay um also something I
had in mind for um for Kevin's um liberal office series actually yes indeed yes and then we had
the hp or community news for last month of which there was one comment and you want to do does one
that was from d o d d dummy in case there was any doubt he says this is a quote from clad 2 today
on mastodon also English is the worst language I wish we'd migrate the way that something
constructed and better like Esperanto says clad 2 it was because I think it was me that was voicing
some other story whether he was referring to Esperanto because he didn't say that uh he would
prefer Esperanto to English as lingua franca but uh I was guessing but that's a confirmation
no absolutely he's mentioned several times on his uh canoe world order uh I'm surprised that he
hasn't done on a learning Esperanto series here in hbr there has been shows about Esperanto way
back in time but I'm not sure who did them just remember seeing them so yeah street it would be
most interesting to learn to learn it to learn I'd certainly be up for that yes over here that's
two and that was a comment of interest hackers plural doesn't tell you any so the next day we had
all tourney tourney tourney every time Liverpool make a fest comes on I think uh I'm really missing
a cool uh shoulder Liverpool make a fest this one about rockets this it looks on what I want to
what a plate yeah from from Tony's pictures it looks like an amazing event really does of course I
missed uh on camp as well so I'm and and um foster yeah yeah yeah really don't want to go to the
network conference so maybe that might make up anyway Steve no surprise that we got a comment
from Steve there rockets thanks for doing the interview concrete dog looked like someone like
he'd get along with quite well Tony replies uh Steve that you enjoyed the show it was an enjoyable
interview to record and the Steve has done a few shows on on rocketry as well yes indeed he has
very interesting ones yeah I'd like to hear more and plot two uh-huh bumping in on the
ock uh on the ock script cutting in in your turf their Dave cutting in your turf oh he's so welcome
very very welcome with the ock dash f if you want to run it from a script to which you were blind
I said hi Klaatu thanks for this heads up it is a confusing feature of oak but it's the same for
said so at least the author is a consistent I don't think we have we've emphasized it enough on
reflection it was highlighted in show two of the ock series and there's been used many times
there after but hasn't been emphasized so thanks again for the feedback it's most appreciated
and this is a typical Dave comment that I get on the daily basis guys you were wrong but in such a
nice way that you can't see anything about it and it says wrong it just said that we we did we did
talk about it but not enough yes I know I'm more nervous sometimes I think I may be messing with
you too much don't know sometimes I do anyway yeah so yeah I'm really your personality here
for coming through do you know it's funny though you can talk about this is because I was looking
back through the ock series and the said series and it's it's there many many many many times
this minus f but no way does it actually say look out guys if you don't use this it'll fall apart
which is what Klaatu is done here which is which is great so you know you get so close to the
subject you you miss these things sometimes so to use for somebody else coming in and saying hey
what about that you know it's feedback is great exactly and this is why I asked you ruined
come on today so he could you know talk to us about stuff where that we take for granted or not
looking at or don't think it's important so yeah absolutely happy to have these discussions
the following day we had a show by JWP not JWP don't call and 1948 true tone D1835 tube radio
and it looks fantastic it's a work of art isn't it it's a beautiful beautiful looking thing I wish
that radios like that were available my father worked collected radios for years and I used
air quotes here which you can see repaired them basically replaced parts and I got interested in
the topic as you know my ham radio thing watching YouTube videos and I stumbled upon a guy who
was doing ham radio and was making these radios safe so I would advise John to to let's just say
the electrical practices back then were completely different to to what they are now and
sometimes the chassis are connected directly to live and they're extremely extremely dangerous so
much so that how previously thought it would be sacrilege to rip out the insides of an old radio
and you know replace it with raspberry pi or something but now I'm changing my mind totally there's
no way I don't have the working knowledge to make a one of these radios safe enough to have it
in your house yeah yeah that's probably true though the the outside of that one would be largely
wood yes there wouldn't be and there would have been a quite a good cover on the back so there
wouldn't have actually been a huge lot of places where you could have could have you know get it
got a shot from a short or anything yeah so it's but I yeah you do have a point I would I would
have a reputable expert in the field they have a look at it from what I saw in the video the
wasn't that much that needed to be done replace a few capacitors and change a few setting change
a few of the circuits so that they're not directly gone all over the place and put in some
insulation and other places so not undoable by somebody who knows what they're doing I'd like
to hear some of the ham radio people's views on this actually I'd like to hear some from the ham
radio round table again which I promised I would not join because I think I ruined it I ruined
it for the guy so please please forgive me yeah hammer on ham how would you say that ham ham
ham ram ram yes yes yes I said tube radio show what an awesome looking radio you brought back
several memories for me I vaguely remember my dad playing a stand up unit in his barn of workshop
I had several push button selectors also I once had a tabletop tube AM radio with a clock
about the size of a toaster then lastly your station playing dark lady wow I had that on 45
if anyone remembers those kind of recordings thanks John for the memories John replies tube clock
radio is so glad you enjoyed this when she started looking around on the internet vintage tube
radios you find that there are tons of these things and the photo galleries are serious eye candy if
you like mid century modern industrial design they also have lots of tube powered clock radios
like you described which had the money in the space to start collecting these things okay let's
move on to the following day which was proof that you you can hear anything of interest daggers
on HPR and it was a hookah show about cancer I must say I did not enjoy the show did not enjoy the
show at all I appreciated the show I was glad we had the show in the network but wow yeah yeah it's
it's it's quite scary I said before I applaud him for for being as open with this sort of stuff
as he is but it's it's an awful an awful thing and it's it is it is one of these things as a
as a as a mayor you tend to worry about the the possibility of ending up with this sort of stuff
so but he seems to have got through it really well and seems very sanguine about the whole
process so congratulations to him and I I like the show because he was very logical about his
approach very logical which to me I I did appreciate that and Stentell Roy says thank you thank you
for this I appreciate your openness and the details he met some reference to the bathtub thing which
I think probably people who go through the treatment understand but it completely went it completely
went over my head so maybe somebody can comment on what that is do you know I didn't I did I
must have missed that you didn't listen to the show Dave you never listen I listen I listen
because it's well yeah yeah I think it was the erectile dysfunction thing at the end
oh okay okay yeah because I have a neighbor who we discuss this subject because he's he's
suffers from prostate cancer which is under control in his particular case so we've had a few
we go the gym together and we end up with interesting conversations as we both
are the rowing machines so how's the cancer then Stuart oh it's coming on fine you know how it is
yes yeah yeah okay into Josh aka 47 not aka all about code and this was Tony used at the
liver food maker fest about the edgy blocks whoa very impressed with this also made me feel like
I happened really had a full filling life would you look at what this guy's been able to do
it's yeah this young fella has has done so much he's really quite an impressive guy he
this edgy blocks thing is just a brilliant idea I think you're tasked with that I think he's
going to go go a long way is did I catch that he's setting up he's set up his own company yep yep
around it yeah yeah that's what I got so what a brilliant thing so yeah good luck to him yeah absolutely
exposing the raspberry pie database through a rest API and no it's not a
expose of the illusions of the raspberry pie it is what it says it is this is actually quite a
good one and by Ken where is the script did you forget to include the script itself which I was
kind of missing in these these episodes because you wasn't enough to follow along yeah it was he
described it quite nicely but it would have been great to have actually seen what he was doing and
and understand it in in more depth because he did you know this it's almost as if I think he
actually had the script in front of him as he was talking about that's how the impression I got
so it's a shame we couldn't join him in reading it yeah but a very interesting thing because
yeah what he's trying to do is very useful I think yeah it was a nice really nice way of putting
things together I thought he was using a python interface to a web interface which is the bottle
framework yeah yeah because this flask and bottle and stuff isn't there that's available and
the whole world is a import bottle from bottle import roof run template roof or such a low name
and then define index name return templates blah hello and then your name using name and then
in run transes whole host logo's port and blah blah blah and that's it yeah it was some it was good
very impressive I could bit more about the rest a bi would be would be a thing because that's
quite a nice an elegant way of doing things but it could do with more explanation not saying that
be easy should do it but to somebody to to do it and WSGI which I like that you called whiskey
that yeah like that I was thinking well how do we get to whiskey oh right right yeah a very nice
demonstration of of quickly put together bit of software I thought you know something that
that you could you know throw together without without a vast amount of effort and get something
quite good out of it once you develop from that starting point so yeah you'd quite like this
looking for some especially on the hbr website there are times where I regret that well not
I don't regret anything it's an hour code so it is what it is but instead of like
apps dot php question mark id equals two six one seven it would be nice to have hbr dot org
forward slash apps forward slash two six one seven and you know just get straight to the show
or hack up public radio dot org forward slash host forward slash can I'm just going to follow
them and you get you know to the host stop with that yeah I like nice ways of interfacing with a
database or something just to be able to do that I did suggest that one time but I think your your
feeling was that to to add that on after the event would be a hell of a thing and I think you're
right yeah I'm thinking of yeah I'm thinking of lots of things but I have very little to be doing
that it might be in our move Dave eventually to have in the back end sporting multiple frontends
it might be an idea to have a size that supports that independently but yeah yeah absolutely
in which case though you could generate the web pages statically so that the automatically come
out and then there are just static web pages after that but anyway the following day we had
yes old first impressions I can't be pronouncing that correctly I'm not sure hey I think it's
it's not English it's a it's a language I think it's um you did show something like that because
I did have a quick look for it and then I completely forgot to check how you say it but uh yeah it's
yes I'll probably do the job yeah it's from again to go to or to go to or and there was one
comment from be easy looking into this yesod seems like a great option for high concurrency web
applications thank you for introducing it to me and to the rest of the HPR community again I'm
kind of putting to a total and flaky and uh sick club into a group of people on the HPR that
are operating at a higher level than myself yes yes I know what you mean me too and I feel
I feel honored that they are gracing us with their knowledge is basically what I'm saying it's yeah
I know um to toto's description of this and the fact that it's Haskell and it's uh something that
you can actively with you with understanding put together relatively easily I was impression I
got easily in a sense of you know if you if you understand the Haskell then you can do that
and it's incredibly powerful no it feels like there's a there's a barrier to be broken through
there that I'd like to have a go breaking through but um I don't know it's he's he's uh I mean
impressed that he's already there well keep chipping out of us keep sending in those shores because
sooner or later it'll start dripling down to us mere mortals and BJB who somebody else who's
could be in that little group as well was talking about quilt the patch manager and excellent
show notes uh excellent examples and I would never think to use something like this but I imagine
that developers would I'm not that much of a developer that I would be needing this well that was
pretty much my feeling too um just because my my developing um stuff is just me do writing stuff and
then you know backing things out that didn't work very well and and all that sort of thing and I
don't know whether quilt would would be useful to me I do feel I ought to to answer that question
properly but uh it certainly sounds like a very clever way of dealing with things but uh yeah
don't know how appropriate it is to me that said I do know the guys in work will I will be sending
this on to them for the simple reason that while the the entire show if you're into patch
management I had the feeling that you would have everything that you ever wanted to know about
quilt basically in this entire episode so a great job there yes some brilliant notes I think you
said that as well but uh very very impressed with the the quality of the notes cool I'm putting that
down as a one that somebody will just listen to and be absolutely blown over when they eventually
uh get to listen to which could be in a few years time that's the thing about HBR these things take
thoughts on language learning part one hang on hang on we missed a comment what did we did we
didn't we RTSN said oh yes this was a great episode thanks
so worth worth saying absolutely very good uh thoughts on learning languages uh shall we deal
with the comments on yeah let's talk about the comments on that so this was a uh learning
notes computer languages this was about learning actual languages and it's a mini series uh by
yeah dodo domi and baffle says nice show this is my first time commenting so I apologize
in advance for any scrubs I believe your point one to move to a new languages as possible
as an x-like deer I'd be interested in helping with developing and discussing it aside to pursue them
there's a great book book book what the future of learning by michelle pommas the michelle
pommas met that by michelle pommas where he discusses the perspective on education that I recommend
as interesting reading and dodo domi replies I have two do I hear three baffled you make viewers
through ups than I do I'll take a look at michelle pommas method I would definitely put time into
developing this out if it seems like there's enough people willing to spend some time two might
be enough a couple more couldn't hurt there you go anyone would time on their hands then the
following day we had maker fest 2018 I say the following day could actually have been over a weekend
we will never know should put in the data actually was a project as it ends in the zero channel
pommas aka little pink maker x some really cool stuff there have you seen their site
I didn't look at the site no after I did I must have done actually I must have done
because I made notes about the fact that she's into biohacking which which sounds quite astonishing
stuff that she's doing maybe she said that or did it say I can't remember I look at these and then
forget lots of stuff and live from my notes yeah amazing stuff Copenhagen fab lab yeah yeah she said
that she she tried to put forward her ideas in the UK and didn't get very far and then has
moved elsewhere to to find to find other people who are more amenable to her thoughts very very
cool stuff that show I like these interviews Tony all messing inside really good interviews it's
that's one thing I like about HGOR is the ability to get these the feel of a show without actually
having to go and the next one raspberry pipe thermometer I was thinking to myself I didn't
have a canister show about the raspberry pipe thermometer and the reason I know that is because
I was intended to do one and it never happened and then somebody else does the show so moral of
the story all the do you show on time and then I listened to it and I was absolutely pulled over
yeah yeah what a great idea for sure it's always wonderful to hear children getting involved
with these things and boy does she sound enthusiastic yeah absolutely easy to do it amazing
comment Ken Fallon why was the no cute warning on this episode seriously a joy to listen I think
if we should have a explicit warning on our shows we should have a cute warning
and DODD dummy says cute than a box of poppies or kittens this ain't what hacking about is about
then hacking ain't worth a plug nipple you said so I made a mess of that but that's such great it's
a good comment and yeah it's like I said it's great to hear family is getting involved with
these things and the kids really obviously yeah being enthusiastic about it all wonderful
and also that they they're doing it because it was on a HPR show inspired somebody to do it
a nice project you can do with your kids excellent absolutely absolutely okay the following day
Plucky wastes and I say wastes three shows about actors agents sprites and fractals where he sits
down and wastes shows by pumping them all into one when they could have easily been split up into
three different shows they covered some grand oh man each of them I each of those topics could
have been a three or four hour session in itself fantastic again Plucky operating at a level
not I'm not a hundred percent up there I'm your I'm your i3 at six versus 64 bit you know what I mean
all right I do very much yeah yeah it was I didn't fully understand all they were talking about
because I find a lot that Clackid does you feel yeah okay you've just skated over the surface but
in order and you understood all the stuff that was below and I don't and I wish you'd tell me
a little bit more and I know he sometimes listens to us saying this sort of stuff and does do that
so yeah but yeah but it's but I still find it fascinating to listen to it it's really cool
if this one talking about three days to listen to because I went to the Wikipedia articles or
the you know the linked stuff and I ended up having to pause the show as I read they you know
this these whole theories I'd never even heard of any of these theories basically Plucky do
every one of those lines in your show notes can you do a show on thanks okay yeah because the
the sort of basic paradigm of putting together software has changed so much in from from the time
that I had my very limited training in this sort of stuff in the early 1970s this is this is just
on such a different level and yeah but not on the other hand because a lot of these theories
were going back to those times so you know they as I said micro micro services are just actors
based services just fascinating all topics fascinating deserves more show what I appreciate the
fact it was a great interview and was really one of these where I felt like I was sitting down with
my back to them having this discussion in a coffee shop yeah absolutely absolutely sorry I just
realized I had a telegram okay I will go on and the following day we had a sightseeing tour
or a soundscape of cycling through Brussels sorry about that either something interrupted me that I
had to go and switch off quickly yes cycling through Brussels yep yep so yes night wise eyes on
his bike going through Brussels what a wonderful thing yes I'd I listened to this a couple of times
actually because I and I was looking at the map as he was commenting on where he was and because
you and I both been there but not it's such a lovely time of the year as he was describing
and you know I knew you pretty much exactly where he was going yes and buying things in the station
in French and yeah yeah I got sort of about 2% of the French to listen to it again to get it
all the thing I was quite interesting he he speaks French with the same accent but he speaks
excellent French but it is you could still tell of us night wise for us some people when
they speak French you can't tell the right you can't tell who it is that's very very interesting
great great show people should send in more of these brilliant yeah Clinton Roy commented fantastic
encore said exactly what you just said my thoughts and language learning and communication
this is the second in the series and yeah I do actually like the idea of the that he proposes
in this series of learning they lots of words because when I went to do my Dutch learning
as I advanced in sentence structure my vocabulary was not keeping up with the advances that I was
making and how the sentence structure was working so I think there is a lot to be said for learning
at least the language is learning day you know Jesui to Eilé News of all who's it is that stuff
just boring yourself learning that in learning all the words there is a lot to be said for that
and then worrying about the grammar later well I agree with that so much at doing French at school
it was all about the you know today we're going to conjugate the verb blah blah blah and you just
and it was just okay so going through some enormous list and it made me fall asleep I that's not
the way I want to I can easily learn stuff I need to actually be immersed in the in the language and
you know soak it up and then as you say go back and say so how do you join these bits together then
say and make sense yeah I would like yeah it's funny I think you I think it is extremely useful
to know the words but I don't know how I like my I don't know how applicable that is to other
languages that are not based on you know Latin languages Germanic languages so that is entire my
entire focus I don't know how it will be in Japan or even Arabic as far as I understand that the
words completely change depending on the on the you know the gender of the word so how applicable
that is it's kind of strange yeah I agree I agree I've certainly found I was able to absorb a
little bit of understanding from listening to people speak in European languages not really
understanding them very well but I did go on a tour of Malaysia years and years ago and it was
for Chinese speakers and it was entirely a Mandarin and I came back with about three words and
that was a case of and they keep saying woman why do they what does that mean it means we in Mandarin
us you know because they kept saying that the tour leader kept saying we are going to go here then
we're going to go there and stuff but I got nothing from that and don't know it's just because I'm
thick or just because I don't have the my ears don't hear that that's that sort of language structure
don't I fascinating captain fascinating Helen and Chris from hackman.co.uk and we're all called
yes Manchester Hack Space very nice I love to have access to a hack yeah it sounds like they've
got some good stuff in the Manchester Hack Space and yeah it sounds like the sort of place you'd
want to go is it for certain exactly yeah so the following day my home form set up I have
I was surprised by the number of comments coming into this my grade says definition of hacking
oh sorry Sigflop finds some phones Cisco IP phones and basically gets them into working order
my grade says definition of hacking brilliant show this show is a real definition of hacking
if I have this right you found some Cisco phones in the garage of a neighbor and set about
getting them to do something useful the joy of getting something to work with obvious from your
tone of voice and your dialogue something that we all can no doubt identify with all the more
satisfying when it risks something previously is regarded discarded be easy says my sentiments exactly
this is the definition of hacking I love how you describe your problem solving process more of these
please Jeswa absolutely spectacular this is the the best part of this wonderful hack in my
humble opinion is that you created something and then used that something to record a HBR show
and D.O.D.D. dummy says scream yell bravo and also this is called a show while I listen to all
episodes of HBR Sigflop is on my must watch now list this one delivered in space spades I think
him it's for me not only was it fun to listen to but I have similar equipment and I've been
meaning to do something similar with there goes my last excuse my only regret is that after the
excellent real hacking phone shows them the last two days my horrible by comparison drivel is up
today so about that my great stoop what the hell is a stoop I think we need an American English
dictionary here Brenda Jay Butler says stoop a stoop is a set of cement steps up to a front door
not as big as a porch not sure if it has to be cement it's actually Dutch I look at that
object so I've I'd heard this before I knew what it was it's Dutch it's a Dutch for a for a front
step no seriously stoop yes T O E B which is pronounced stoop it's it's it's from the it's the
Dutch and it was the Dutch settlers in New York that coined it yes Dave I know stoop
Christ is a paving pavement chalk you run can you verify that please sorry can you repeat that
because actually I was offline for a second well not more than a second because I'm like I said
I wasn't on the holiday and I'm I have this nice flat-rate pricing plan for my cell phone
but I got a call and I found out that I've got a call my data is gone so I just rejoined a second
ago so can you please repeat the question and I'll be happy to answer no worries in one of the
episodes one of our I think a cyclop is from New York she mentioned that she found it outside
on the stoop and that's so there was a question in the comments about where the stoop comes from
and Dave mentioned it's originally Dutch from stoop Christ and so well yeah a stoop is just the
Dutch word for sidewalk yep so there you go great very well Amsterdam yeah yeah yeah it's it's a great
world so the following day we had the UK telephone network exploration which was apt giving
us a cyclop had just done a other show previously and she does some phone freaking on the
British phone network this was interesting yes this this was fascinating wasn't it it's
it's basically finding some numbers that you you have access to as a British Telecom engineer some
of which allow you to do further investigations of of interesting numbers so you can you can
dial a block of numbers and things so who knew I didn't know that I knew some of those actually
one that that makes it dial back but yeah yeah we need more like that that's that's fascinating
I remember we used to do that dial back thing like to pretend as pranks so you go to the hall
use that number and you know run away and then a few minutes later the phone ring and you pick up
the phone and then you go yeah what do the guards you're looking for somebody else in the house
or you're the police you're looking for somebody in the house yeah that's sort of never got
all this brings back phone memories of way back when there was a big community doing this kind
of stuff in the Netherlands and also sort of socially hacking the semaphore network where they were
picking well using antennas and picking semaphore messages out of the network and then
in that of and and the most of the time those semaphore networks sorry messages contained a
phone number to ring so instead of somebody else ringing them they rang that number and for
instance some girl would pick up the phone and said yeah expecting her boyfriend to to pick her
up after a party or whatever and they would say something like well who John no John's not here
John's not there what do you mean he's not there well you know this angel I came by and they decided
to go out on the town and then they would really piss off the girl and those kinds of socially pretty
lame but very funny jokes hilarious evenings what's the semaphore network well maybe semaphore is
wrong but I don't know what the correct English term for this but so you you have a beeper you know
you had a boat on your belt yeah and with a small display and and you could then a pager's a
pager that's it yeah okay yeah pager you're you're absolutely right oh how stupid I feel no
no no it's a pager there's a show you can do two first oh well lots of shows I've also been a
of the T a fireman firefighter for 10 years so enough stories there as well and I've got two girls
with handicaps so there are stories where with that as well even writing software to analyze
medical instruments to to to give a proper advice to a specialist awesome cool okay you owe me all
those shows well let's take it one show at a time I'll tell you what you record the shows every
show you do I'll give you a beer if we ever meet oh you're so warm that could get very expensive
260 beers a year okay yeah well it's it's a good argument to to visit or camp again next year
with all the Brexit stuff I probably need some expensive visa or something but well with
all the beers in exchange I think it could be worth my while okay Dave if you see him again you
I'm not sure I'm probably not going to outcome okay let's move on thoughts on learning
now which part three the game story mold did we hold on a second did we miss a comment on the
previous show oh yes yes yes yes this was from d o d d dummy who said memories thoroughly enjoyed
this episode during large part to remembering the times read or listen to people talking about
several things in my youth I did try some of them out but mostly read or listen to people
describing the experience on the sit the parent of this shows parent show parent show they did
radio freak america they did a lot of this stuff on back on episode 22600 we aired their first show
well if you go back and listen to those hundred episodes you get quite a lot of this whole scene
at the time really really enjoyable anyway learning language game story mode so
dodo dummies idea is you wake up and you don't know the language you're you're
wake up in a hospital you have no memories and basically you have to navigate round and learn
the language of the country or whatever language that they're speaking in that place that you
have to be and I thought this was a brilliant brilliant idea yeah when I saw the title I thought
games well how about that work and wow that is a very very nice idea head there yeah absolutely play
that I was thinking if as he's walking up in a hospital he could walk around the children's
departments yeah and look at their at their story books there and then learn a few things
have to go down to the canteen and point out at the food and order the food there so there's lots
that you can do in that in that whole mode brilliant brilliant idea absolutely a lot of somebody did
this yeah right cool and then the next show more gaming seems to be a lot of gaming open source
gaming revisiting revisiting meridian 59 recorded before release the dude highly anticipating
the release of this game do you ever played no no I'm not not really much of a gameplay I'm afraid
I think steam has made a beginroads recently into supporting more Linux stuff so yeah good name I guess
yeah yeah absolutely so that was the shows and there was one previous comment which was under
show how I helped my dad run a static website on sparkly share by clacky and it was a comment by
himself which was a full episode on sparkly share for a complete rundown of when hot and how do you
sparkly share see tattoos episode 2609 really full full of him to go back and do that I should have
made them myself yes that's it will it will be linked though because the questions to comment
won't it yes but it would be nice actually on the website to go dig in myself into a bigger hole
to have a way of relating episodes together because we do that quite often it would be nice
to have it somewhere that would generate a sort of link circle if you remember such a thing from
the early days of the web yeah I've often thought that it would be good to I've often seen cases
where it would be quite quite good to to drop a link to two other related shows just just
because I happen to notice it was something like that but that's why we're trying to build a tag
thing of course that would be another way of doing it so that's part of it yeah yeah it's
going way to go yet though the only time I particularly do that is if it's a controversial
episode where one episode is a comment back to a previous episode yeah episode 69 springs to mind
okay yeah just just one one question that pops up by now so every month you discuss all the
the podcasts that you've broadcast right yeah and since my first podcast will be available in a few
days it's likely that you will discuss my podcast as well next month right absolutely oh my god
and well thankfully I can then listen to this podcast but then for next month edition or I could
join in the recording just as I'm doing now and at least respond through to whatever you're
discussing about my podcast yeah you can or you can and the reason we do this is because
HBR has been going for over almost 13 years now and quite often the shows they're also released
in creation common so it's it's common for people to release them on on local college stations and
local radio stations and local cable networks and the like and so occasionally you'll get a
comment back on your show maybe two three months or two or three years even after it's been aired
oh wow yeah well it's that's the funny thing about the internet I've experienced that when you
it has happened to me several times you know I'm I'm based in the Netherlands I find a bug
something that bothers me I find a workaround you publish it somewhere in a news group and then
two three months later you get maybe I even got a response from a sezadmin of a really big university
saying elaborate things for the fixer that I posted and it's well it's something that when you
read it you can it gives you energy for at least two or three more days but it's it's amazing how
in a way the internet this way makes a village of of the whole world absolutely and the thing that
um when when we have new hosts on the thing that discourages and most most is not getting feedback
for your shows uh when I come on it was the thing that discouraged me got no feedback from my
show until two years in and then somebody commented on one of my shows saying hey you're wrong
about this and yes of course I was because we're talking about a release of something that had been
done six months before our um two year it was two years out of date so it was no longer relevant but
that is why we've tried on this show to make sure that everybody gets two people or gets some positive
feedback usually positive feedback on their shows Dave shows on all of course our open game
yeah yeah yeah all all of course a standard and must have for every uh we're self-respecting
as his admin so indeed it's it's a it's a it's a good series to have very much so yes indeed so we had
uh on the mail archive we had a notification of the uh on the mailing list by the way is open
to anybody who's in the HBIR community and you know you're in the HBIR community if you're
If you're listening to this show, you're definitely in the HPR community if you contribute
chills.
If you contribute chills over a longer period of time or help off the community, then you
become a trusted member of the community.
When does that happen?
See Plato show about trust.
Was that even on this network?
Or was it on his new work order?
It was on this network.
And very, very good show relating to that.
So we had tags and virtualizations, and if you don't mind, Dave, I'll let you do this
one.
Well, this is BJB, who's been a great help with adding tags shows.
And she was thinking about adding tags to a particular show, I can't remember which one
31 maybe, and noticed that there were two spellings of virtualization in the system,
one with an S, one with a Z.
And she's wondering how we, basically how we do.
I'm paraphrasing.
So what we do is we ensure that the Americans told the line and spell it properly with
a Z.
Well, yeah.
That was my reaction.
I was going to go through and just do the spelling correction all the way through the
system.
But somebody might call me arrogant.
So that was an interesting point.
And how should we deal with this, which really, her comment, should we know, and how should
we do a similar, similar cases of the color with them without you and those types of things.
So the, how do you get to the next message?
Yeah.
So we got a response back from Mike Ray, who said, why not use eSpeak phoning as part of
the tag, which he, I think if you, if you run eSpeak on a word, it will generate
a phonymic version of it.
Instead of speaking, I have done this, but I've forgotten the details of it.
And so why not just store that?
Of course, that would be a pretty good approximation to the word.
And it should be very similar between two spellings of a thing.
So that seemed like a pretty good idea.
And it was an interesting one I'd never told of it.
No, that was, that was something I'd not thought of either.
And I said, great idea.
I'd actually played around with Sandex in the past with an LDAP system I'd had to build.
And I'm just in careful not to lose my press talk here as I changed page.
So Carl Hammond says Sandex is pretty simple, it's very simplistic.
So maybe that's not the best way of going about it.
And there are other alternative ways of representing,
assume it's a sort of hash-like structure.
So I think the general conclusion is something a bit more sophisticated than that would
be the way to go.
And at the moment, I'm thinking that Mike's suggestion, Sand, Sand's best.
Pretty cool.
So yeah.
That's it.
If it works, it's kind of cool.
Yes, yes.
Except you need, you just need to take a word, turn it into the phonemes and look it
up by phonemes.
So presumably, we could implement something like that once we have a good collection of
tags to play with.
It would also solve the comma versus space thing.
So if you could, if you come up with a phoneme for one word versus two words together versus
three words together, if you found a match without the first word, if you didn't find
a match on, I don't know, networking hardware, just thinking to, if you didn't get a
hit, I'm networking, but did get a hit, I'm networking hardware, then you can wait
them on that.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah.
There's some interesting ideas there to think about, anyway.
Yeah, there's also a way I'd like to make the whole back end more open so that people
could start working on this.
There's lots and lots of interesting stuff.
I think would be available to people if you could get that.
Med available.
But no, no, there you go.
So the common spam stuff, or a question, I don't know.
If Jason Dodd has been funny here or not, I've been trying to leave a comment on the
HBR episode and keep getting blocked by the spam for a prevention question.
The correct answer to the question, what does the PE and HBR stand for is, of course, perfect,
but it's not accepting us.
But some would please fix this and let me know.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's a joke, I would say.
It's hard to know.
I'm autistic, so I apparently don't have a sense of humor.
Well, I certainly found it amusing.
But yeah, I still haven't seen that comment from Jason Dodd, though.
It's a fact called DODD dummy, he keeps on commenting, but it's just complete coincidence.
Could be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All righty, are we done, Dave?
Is there anything else?
Just to say any other business, I just like to take the opportunity to thank people
who contributed tags and summaries and stuff.
We had one, we had contribution from BJB and just at the very very last minute, she did
do her episode 31, I think it was that she said she was going to do and I said possible
future host Baffled, who also sent in a block of updates and I think I was playing a political
game there by the possible future host.
I did say to him, because once you are a host, then it would be very easy to know what
handle you prefer and stuff like that.
Yeah, true.
Yeah, yeah.
Especially if you pick something really complicated, you'll be buttering your name, stumbling
over it forever.
Yes.
So.
That's it then.
Right, that is that for this month.
Yeah, tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of Hacker Public Radio.
