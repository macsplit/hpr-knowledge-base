What was it that the state currently continues to do?
to do those of you that are new and even those of you that are all. So, did I get everybody here tonight?
No, that's a big knock. All right, so I'll start now with the flash.
I'm still stripping for New Year's. I'm going to continue from where I left off.
I said, one of the members, oh yeah, I'm going to have to pin us to...
This is the new recession, if anyone doesn't understand.
Anything?
Yes, sir.
Okay, well, I have some other things that I can.
Anyone has any questions about anything? I feel free to say something.
What's a newbie?
A newbie is a...
I don't know, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Newbie is right.
Anyway.
All right, so somewhere in here.
How does it be the art here and does it be the work?
Hi, Sam. I was a miss little program that I've written.
You can chill.
You can do a business practice like output.
So, if you have a file and you know, it prints it out.
So, okay, let's have it in two columns.
And kind of useless, but nevertheless, I'm sure it's good.
So, just to show you by what this does again.
I'll type a new spread.
And let's read off one.
And ask me what is the number of columns on the screen?
It's not, but I'll say eight.
Number of lines on the screen will say it is 30.
And there we go.
Actually, let me show you...
Let me show you the camera.
So, you can see how it's...
You can just, you know, be around to be the question of what we want.
And it goes out to about this form, right?
And the problem that I've got is the first way to be in shape here.
Play.
But, so, whenever I run that,
and I can assume this is a project that I wrote,
I'm going to ask you the number of columns,
just eight,
number of lines, 30.
And now, it's in sort of a new spread, sort of, right?
It shortened it up around the side.
But, so, you read it down here to the end,
just have it come from who's,
and then you start back up in the next column, right?
Yeah, it's fascinating.
And I know what it's like.
All right, so how did I do that?
And we were at...
We were looking at the file.
We had gotten somewhere to around...
I'm not talking about you here.
Keep on.
If you remember, on the top, I'd set the debugger true.
And I said that all of a sudden,
people are...
They're presented, they're presented,
echoed, called it with...
The debugger set the true.
The true is a program that returns zero to zero here.
So, with the double ampersand, which is a logical hand,
this thing will test if this is true.
And if it is true, then it will execute the second part,
just to see if it's true.
In our case, the debugger is set to true.
True returns true.
So, we'll echo the problem.
So, what this is doing is putting some debugger out there
and it's free for us to show...
Give you a smile for that.
So, debugger.
Now, if I set it to the top of the calls,
the false program returns one as it's returned by,
which is a correct value,
which is a correct value to be incorrect,
that it makes sense.
One as returned by a means error.
So, it correctly returns a error, right?
False should be false, right?
So, if this were to execute,
and I've set the false on true,
debug to be false on the top,
this would execute with short circuits, ampersand, ampersand.
So, we need to follow the rest of it, right?
That's the way that we're going to do it.
All right, now, here we got the format,
command deputy,
I said the way that I had asked me earlier,
or that I didn't,
in this particular case,
the file name that I put in earlier,
and it's read the right sentence of pop-up
the same file name.cundv.
So, if you look here,
we've got...
we've got...
No, wait a minute.
Okay, no, wait a minute.
We've got...
So, in a little bit,
was it will create a pop-up,
a bandwidth up to 10, right?
I'm building it later on.
Okay, okay.
Any questions so far?
About following?
It's hard to follow when you weren't here for the pop-up.
Anyway.
So, there's some different ways that this...
calculated the...
I've tried to find out what the number of lines of that
original file is.
The last one I'm excited about was working out
with the dashed alpha lines.
So, we see working out...
dashed alpha lines.
And read the right path of 10 into...
we're going to switch in the number of lines
in a bandwidth up to 10.
So, the format...
has changed its to be from this line to 80 models.
So, it's going to show up in rapid...
in rapid,
because that would chop off a word.
It wraps it nice into word boundaries
and pulls up the envelope of the length of line, okay?
So, it looks nice.
A bit of a more count.
Now, I've got a variable file on this file
that has a work down to 8.
Or whatever the number of lines is in.
And the camera type is...
it's...
that's a false apartment.
If you pass this one...
Okay.
And if you've got a file...
a bandwidth up to 10 has...
the number of lines...
lines...
and say, at this...
Slick into 10...
number number...
counts on counts on this to indicate...
that at this point in the program...
it's split.
So, if you're wondering...
trying to figure out what's wrong with the program...
it's split into 10.
So, at this point,
that's going to split into operations.
So, split, isn't it?
Whereas before,
you could use KN...
and give it number of lines...
that you put in...
I've typed in 30 lines...
and said that you can...
pre-direct that to about 10.
0.0 files...
like that.
And then,
comes the point that you do the next...
number of lines...
two times of lines...
which would be...
better...
60.
So, from...
the 60 lines...
and...
okay, so this...
Alright, so it's yet 0.0...
it gets the first...
30 lines.
Right.
And then...
when we do it from the...
the first of 60 lines...
I've typed that into tail...
of 30.
So, it does make...
second 30 lines.
So, everybody follow me there?
So, uh...
again, we'll do 60...
we do the tail...
60...
our third, right?
So, that's the next...
30 lines.
If I follow them...
okay.
And then, we'll re-direct it into 10.1.
Okay, 0.0.
So, that's one way of doing it.
Alternatively, we can use this part we call split.
And what split does is it...
splits the bar...
into...
same length...
uh...
another bar.
Um...
I did, um...
the dash d, which I think stood for...
decimal, or something like that.
Um...
And what...
Okay, so, it's a split...
dash d, now...
the tail requires a lines grammar.
So, I'm telling you, uh...
30 lines.
Uh...
Our lines line...
L lines.
Um...
The following thing you're going to split...
and what you want me to start with...
is the prefix.
So, in this case, what split is going to do...
is it will split...
and it will be produced...
1.10...
into 30 line files...
starting with 10...
and you can decimal back to that.
In other words, you're going to file out...
10...
0...
with the first 30 lines...
10...
0, 1...
with the second 30 lines...
10...
0, 2...
2...
0, 3, 0, 4, 5, 12, 11, 11, that's right.
If you don't give it the D option...
the default is to do...
A, A, B, A, C, A, D, A, B, F, A, F...
A, F...
blah, blah, blah...
That's...
I don't like that, but...
and whatever.
So, in...
we've got the...
we've been going out for the pasting together...
we used a paste pattern...
which I've talked about...
two months ago...
three months ago perhaps...
Paste, as you remember, takes the first line of...
the first 30 lines file...
the first line of the second argument file...
the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, sixth, eighth, whatever...
and it needs to get it in...
that should pop into it...
and puts all those first lines...
onto one line.
It takes the second line of each one of them...
puts all the second lines...
so you've got this...
huge, long...
file...
or output...
it's standard out...
that has the...
the combination of all these files...
does that make sense?
So, basically, what this is doing...
with the combination of...
formatting the file...
tricking it into the word...
it works nice...
then we split it into...
equal length files...
and we paste those files together...
it takes this one of them...
puts up here...
and...
there you go...
that's...
that's the...
visual print line...
output...
I'm just going to remove the files for...
a bit...
better...
and there you go...
that's the little visual print program...
yeah...
okay, that's great...
wonderful...
if any questions...
and what I've done...
besides the question...
why...
no?
okay...
alright, so let's try to think of...
what else we haven't covered...
um...
one thing that I do is...
almost constantly...
daily basis...
years before...
before...
and I use this mostly from the command run...
which you can also put in...
in shell scripts...
so I wrote, um...
actually I just typed out some...
some...
but rather...
that took my command...
my history...
and...
so I'm going to show you...
and these are what's something out...
the...
pinnest...
so we've got to say...
four fonts...
so here's a little...
four...
pouches...
a format of four...
and I can do a four...
loop...
and...
in shell...
should do four...
some...
variable...
in...
and then...
and then...
a list of stuff...
the word two...
and you do your...
whatever you want...
to loop through...
and then done...
your block is between the two that are done...
and the four is what's...
um...
any mystery...
so uh...
in...
on the street...
on the...
blackboard...
whiteboard...
this is a whiteboard just...
uh...
I've got a variable that I'm creating called V...
and uh...
I've got a list here...
of some sort...
it's going to put...
so the first item is a V...
and then use V in here somewhere...
it's going to go back...
it's going to go to the second item...
so that in the V...
blah, blah, blah...
the third item for...
until it runs out...
um...
so...
what I had done one week...
before any of y'all got here...
was I was trying to figure out what wasn't the nicest on my...
uh... on the projector here...
to be described...
and so I wrote this little thing on...
at the minimum...
for i in...
and I always use i because...
i as mine...
uh...
in the middle...
uh...
in the beginning...
something really funny...
okay...
okay, so for i in...
and then I've got this cap...
and this star...
whoa...
um...
so the list of items that I'm going to have is everything that's in this folder...
um...
you know, this is the star in the case...
it's a clock...
it means...
uh... all files in this...
right...
um...
and I do a two...
and I do an echo...
just...
just...
uh...
you know what...
what's wrong...
just space it out...
you know, uh...
the set font command...
to whatever that gives me...
and then sleep in one second...
the file in this program...
which I have it...
um...
so, uh...
we'll all see if this works right...
uh...
yeah, I can't listen to it...
okay...
so you see, it's...
it's going through the...
uh...
okay, that's how the clock's changing...
set font...
modulating...
console changes the font to what's in this program...
if I just did this the other day...
just to see what would be best...
because look...
for everyone to look at...
you know, I think I can sell the font one...
and I just...
okay, and then play around...
and then...
make sure I set the one that we can really look at...
and then...
and then...
and then...
you know...
so, uh...
it's a whole lot of taxes...
I was unsure what I was trying to do...
and then I just went through...
right, I just...
I didn't think of...
I figured this thing was...
okay...
so, um...
set font on the works of the console though...
it won't work in your extra...
uh...
anyway...
all right, so, there's, uh...
four reports tests...
so, we had had discussions early on...
um...
what's the difference between the test program
and the test built-in...
what's the difference between the...
echo built-in and check-up program?
um...
most sort of questions...
so, if you want to discuss a little...
program called...
the full performance system...
it's actually used to set a day...
uh...
I wanted to see which would be faster...
for me, it was uh...
between the CMD compare and dip...
which would be faster...
obviously, CMD expression...
so, uh... I did three...
three loops right here...
or I had one, two, three...
I was going to get one...
and then I was going to get two...
the I...
and here you see...
but I know how many loops there is...
uh... I do the time command which will show...
on the screen...
the user system...
and...
other time...
I can't remember what that other time is...
and, um...
then I do a loop right here...
and what I've done is I'm timing before
of a thousand C...
okay, so here's a new program called CQ...
which does a sequence...
it'll practice the straight...
or, well, it'll practice sequence of numbers...
in this case, uh...
if you use this one argument, it's going to be one and two that...
um... you can also give sequence a starting number...
and a...
uh... increment number...
so, if I wanted to do all the odd numbers all of them...
uh... visible by three of...
between 50 and
two thousand or something like that...
uh... the sequence will do that...
and it may just seem specifically...
um...
so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a dollar sign for it...
of C...
1,000...
set, set, 1,000...
and it's going to, you know, it's a list of
zero to 1,000...
puts it in j...
and then I'm going to do a dollar sign...
act...
and what the dollar sign act does is it gives all the arguments
to...
program that you gave it...
so, argument 1, argument 2,
but whatever you give to this program, right?
so, if I do a...
uh...
four...
performance test of...
uh...
take the echo...
echo...
echo...
hello...
now the sign...
yeah...
okay, so, I will do that...
yeah, so I'm going to do...
uh...
oh my, I can do the screen...
let's do it...
let's go to the command, uh...
test...
our own true...
yeah...
and the other is...
so I have the...
test true...
he's my arch, I'm not listening to him...
okay...
no means no...
okay, so, uh...
this is going to be the built-in test...
uh... true, I was going to return true...
so, I did...
uh... three...
times...
you know, it's going to be different...
so you want to have a look at this sample...
so we see here the real user system...
real user system...
okay, so this...
and that's how fast this one is...
so, let me do the same thing with a
slash...
slash test...
is the faster or slower...
I'm not sure...
whoa, that's not right...
it's slower...
it's not...
there's some reason the user is very user-friendly...
uh...
and these work...
we can tweak the sequence...
oh, look at that...
these two seconds of speed...
versus the built-in which is...
so, obviously, the built-in test is faster than the...
the program test...
but we all figured that out, right?
okay, so that's performance...
just...
any questions?
we have anyone who is new to a shell program...
am I?
okay, are you following along?
do you understand everything I've said so far?
I'm not sure...
every single...
user...
that's what I think...
that's what I think...
I think that's what I think...
okay...
any questions?
I don't understand what you said...
do you guys look real pretty?
I get it, you're...
I get it, you're...
hey, problem...
hey, you're...
high-brace...
do you have any questions on those?
I mean, with this new obsession...
you haven't...
that wasn't worth it...
these are the most important things I've said...
all right...
yeah, I have...
that's right...
okay...
I assume you aren't sure...
let me uh...
cat house out for a week...
last month my archer
went along here...
a hurls grip to redeem a bunch of files, right?
well, I used four in the same thing...
and so what I do here is uh...
where I am start making...
so all I see in people's files...
I do a move...
of that file...
to...
um...
the same file I'm without making...
okay...
and I'm done...
I um...
I'm gonna just create a bunch of files...
so I'm gonna sense this...
the slacks, my shoes...
the pattern after this...
yeah, let me, let me know in just a second...
let me create a bunch of files...
uh...
what is that?
um...
okay, so...
I did...
but not long time being can...
hahaha
okay, so...
I just created a bunch of files,
uh, one, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, right?
so I used...
I was using to create a bunch of...
I got a little bit here, Seeklist is twenty Five, touch and I can be briefing.
Alright so, what was the first question?
Early brace I go to three lines up here.
OK, that's a that's a...
That's a fascism.
And so let's say out one to three square root of
very well called Clever, so I can take any clever name. Clever is a little, um, hello.
Or even, what do we do?
Okay, so if I echo Josh's sign Clever, it echoes all of them, right? That's pretty simple.
Now, if I, uh, and the same with the braces, and actually, uh, good practice says you want to have the braces,
because that way you can pleniate it between another very good called Clever, or Clever-ish,
or Clever-ish, or Clever-ish, probably.
Right?
Right?
Right?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
All right, so if I use a slash, what you can do then is you can start to replace the slash,
or the same with the regular questions, if you think that's it.
Yes.
Or it does.
Um, so if I do, uh, uh, search for H, replace it with capital H, then, yeah, see, that didn't work.
You know what?
If you were the last one, you don't want the last slash.
It's our place.
It's our place, the lowercase space with the capital H, search over what, right?
Um, capital H, but it didn't change it.
So when you didn't have that section slash, three times, when we previous it,
it just said, yeah, if you don't have it in the after, if you don't have the second slash,
it's just kind of dropping.
It's kind of dropping, whatever you say.
So the problem I've got right here is, uh, I take off the second slash,
and just as, uh, I do a, uh, uh, sub-quest, if you said replace,
now only with value, if you want, we'll say, value, value, value,
if you hold it, we'll change the value.
So again, if you change, if you took it, it says,
value, I'll say, I'll be, key value, right?
Okay.
No, that's why that didn't work.
No, no, no, that's why.
I don't think that's the wrong idea you know, you know, you just,
take the, uh, key slash out.
Okay.
Okay, good.
Um, now, something that I've got to say is that you have one thing I'm going to,
give it quite a speck, uh, with, something more replacement,
one person, I'm, yeah.
So I'm going to give it one first time.
You see, right here, I thought, yeah, maybe, it's like that,
and then you give this slash, you do it with low,
certain prices that it's, it's a slash key.
It's been this with us a little bit more, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not actually the real difference,
but it hardens back.
Yeah.
All right.
So that's, all right.
So I created all these files,
one through 20PT,
Paul Paul.
I'll say that.
And, first of all,
all right.
All right.
Well, I am something people do,
move my eyes up,
and so I'm going to do that,
and do for rename.
And then now I do an LS.
See, I'll find answer to drop the community, right?
So, similar to what you had done,
but different.
So,
and in fact,
they use the rename program
more often,
which is fashion.
Okay, any other questions?
Someone had a question, too.
No?
Well, we got here.
Reading in thousands, okay.
Four thousands.
You saw me up here,
three LNs bug files.
We're those testing you work,
where we have,
we want to have thousands of
folders and stuff.
Folders and those is thousands.
Folders,
and other files in those
thousands of bug files.
Well, we're going,
we're going,
performance testing.
About our five.
So, what I've got here is,
what?
I don't know.
Okay.
I changed the five
from 1000,
because this was run online.
And I did,
I did a four,
I and sequence five,
due to make sure of I.
So, it'll do,
it'll create five right,
and in fact, it'll get run.
Let me make a folder,
called,
yes.
Seeding into that form.
You know,
I'm going to do a,
it's called four thousands.
Everyone's program.
Get an LS.
You see I've got one,
two, three more five.
I've got one,
two, three, four five.
Inside that, one.
I've got an LS of one slash one.
I've got a file called one dot one.
If I cat that,
it's a directory.
So,
I want to slash,
and inside this file
is the text one slash one.
So,
to the program itself,
try to see what's five,
run this loop five times,
do a major,
or five.
It creates the first room,
actually,
because
it's taking a better idea
of what's going on here.
All right.
Seeding,
we've got one,
one slash two,
file called one dot two.
And inside that file,
it is text one slash two.
All right.
So, it's,
you know,
seven dollars closed,
both stayed in.
All right.
So,
all right,
when we make here,
we're going
to do another of five loops inside of those five loops.
the 1, 3, 5 slash 1, 3, 5.
I says they can be used to write the derivative.
OK?
5, that's 4, 5, that's 4, 5, 5, 5.
1, 5.
They're going to follow me.
Alright, so make a little bit of reference.
Any questions?
No?
Speak up.
Then I do another loop.
I get to just loop 5 times to inner loop of 5 times
and do entry equals
i such j.
So I'm just creating a variable called entry.
It has the, what the out just has
the first number slash second number.
You know, it's this and here.
And then echo that to
and recreate that to this directory.
So echo, no one's on entry will echo
5 slash 5 as well.
Into 5 slash 5 slash
and those 5 slash 5 take out the slash
and replace it with a dot.
OK?
It's quite simple.
It's a big big problem.
Yes.
Because the forward slash is a certain
replacing them into the dars and breads.
You have to escape forward slash.
Here's a really weird statement
with the back slash.
Yes.
Here's a really weird question.
I do some certain place
to the delimiter.
Does it have to be a forward slash?
Or do you think any other delimiter will come up?
I think you can say that.
I think you can say that.
Right.
You said you can't.
The bell sound brace in the batch has
each character has different meanings.
Is that mean of the forward slash?
It has to be forward slash.
If you use the comma,
I think that has any meaning,
but you do it equals and says
it to the fault value of that variable.
There are other things like that.
Colony equals it.
You have to do the main thing.
But there's a lot of things that I didn't feel like I'm
going to be more interested in.
The main forward slash.
Manage your friend.
Info is your second friend.
Heal is a good friend.
What if a poet and a man are friends with dogs?
Because I know he is a dog.
But dogs better than cats.
I use less.
I use less.
I use less.
I use less.
What if he said Google Transolve?
What if he said Google Transolve?
He didn't.
Right.
All right, sir.
What?
It's an example.
You can't say that.
It's a dog.
Hey.
I made word statute.
Thank you.
I went out of there.
Can anybody understand what's going on right?
It's kind of complicated.
It took me a long time to figure out how to do this, so, you know, process something.
Now, you could change this around.
See, I'm going to explain it at different times.
That's because I did it at the man.
I figured at different times.
If you were to call it right, this is a script.
I wouldn't have done it this way.
I would have had this one loop of C plus five.
Now, I had this J in the loop.
I would have put the maker before that.
And it's a set that you took here.
So I didn't have to make the dirt out of the maker.
And then the echo.
And then the gun down another.
Right?
Because that was our...
That was just two guns.
Right?
All right.
Any questions on four?
Questions on four?
There is another...
There is another round.
Four will also...
As I understand it, if you don't put the gun in,
it's assumed of...
I'll check one and also two and also three.
I'm going to use this on.
It's not going to teach all that.
Although, no, no.
If you leave it in, if you leave it all at blank,
it's going to slip.
Not at all.
The arguments.
As I understand it, I have...
I myself have never used it.
So...
Good luck.
So we sit for...
I do...
I accept whatever arguments.
As I understand it, I don't know.
It does...
It does actually happen.
As I understand it.
Because I read the man page,
and that's what he said.
I don't know.
But I have tried to accept it.
Another format for four in Bash is the...
What you're probably used to in...
In the C-Lite languages for...
Prin...
Something...
Sympical and something...
Sympical and something that you...
That you're initiator here,
for your test, for your...
But I never used that kind of experience.
And...
Are we going to...
In the questions on four?
No.
Of course not.
We all understand.
Alright, we all have...
What I have for you.
Yes.
So now let's see you.
I'll print this for you and you.
You can print it.
That's my...
I'll print it.
You can print it.
You can print it.
You can print it.
You can print it.
You can print it.
Yes.
So now, see you use it.
You can print it.
It's very complicated.
You can't say it's not what I mean.
Yep.
You can just do it on my own.
How?
I'm just going to print it.
Yeah.
And then...
And then I'll...
I'll print it.
I'll print it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, guys.
I have to do that.
So you can print it.
That was the...
That was the future of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can print it.
Now, should I ask you,
as when it later is?
But...
I'll print it.
Alright.
So the dose of the bang goes on you.
Um...
I also use this job control in the bang.
I'm sorry, the job control in here.
No, this is history.
I'm sorry, this is history.
The bang is all history stuff.
So anything that starts with bang is history.
If you do a bang bang, that is the last command.
The previous command.
So this just did a bang bang substitute.
It goes 4,000, which was this, right?
The thing is my command.
You can tell it banged in a number.
That's the number in the history that you get.
So if I do a history...
history...
and you sell this command, I would do a bang 602.
That was LS, so you didn't know this.
Um...
If I know what it is and I don't remember what it was,
I'll set it in front of the history again.
Let's say I want to just do the last make-up.
Alright, so I do a bang make-up.
You know, up until it's uniqueness,
it will...
If you're typing, then you don't want to do the bang stuff.
You can actually do it with the escape team.
So you can say escape 4, escape dog.
And it will pull out the 4th command line argument
from the line in the right before you.
So I don't know if you're using it.
It's hard to say.
It's just your question.
The dog sign...
um...
I'm sorry.
Bang dollar sign is the last argument
of the previous command.
Right.
Right, but I simply put one question.
The analyst...
So this date is going to be a placement test.
Okay.
Okay.
I think...
I think the thing I saw you knew
if you had seen it on this,
it was really huge.
It's an argument on the last,
maybe it's all new.
Right.
Alright, so I do...
It's going to do just this last word.
I'm here at the end.
Okay.
Um...
Now, I know this is the past couple of years,
there's a lot more smart about it.
If I do it, the dollar sign will go in,
and then something's made something's listed.
It likes to do that entire thing.
So that's nice.
Now, the very end date was that searching
from the bottom down,
from the bottom to...
From your grocery store,
from the last one,
from your grocery store.
So it's keeping you in the bottom of it.
Can you...
get a key in it, not?
So...
So instead of you just wanting to give a dinner
to people that actually...
Did I fail that command?
No.
Because if I did...
If I did 14 copies,
and I go, well,
I don't want to retire, you know,
a barrel of time at coffee,
but I can't, so you can't cycle through
just your copies.
And for the dollar,
you know, also,
you need to control our,
and then I'll go to your most recent,
whatever match,
throughout the entire string.
Okay, do it.
Do it.
Go on.
Think of it.
Sir?
Yeah, this is...
I'll see.
I don't know.
Then you do control over it.
Okay.
Then you do nothing down here,
through all here,
and then...
All right.
So now I...
I don't know how to do it.
It's actually control or arrow.
If I look for clever,
C, L,
and there it is.
So here's what I just typed in.
This is what you can just did
and complete search.
You can get it in the backwards.
You know, you can get it in with the report.
Yeah, forward.
That's the control arrow.
Now, the bang does...
You can just start when you do it.
And bang up there.
You can do that.
This is the bang.
This is the single bang,
the single bang.
You can do that.
Okay.
Anything else?
I guess it's on camera.
All right.
Let me hand this over to our MC,
with a knife.
Thank you all.
First of all,
this is a recognize.
So we might go around random.
We'll start with the eights.
And the eights.
This is when...
Do you know how to do it?
Do you know how to do it?
You make some...
Do it.
Do it.
It's really easy work.
You're doing an interview.
Say you're ZS.
Do it, say it.
How can I do it?
It makes me...
I'm Mikey Andrews.
Feel me.
Always do the laundry up,
straight off,
is the only thing
you want me to do all these things for you every afternoon.
Is it quite difficult?
It's normal,
to put the...
Yeah.
You'd be wearing lunas.
We'll wear,
and all these...
So I won't do harm,
So I'm walking on the line and I'm going to reach out to a little bit of ice.
Well thanks for coming, I appreciate that.
That's a little bit of a draw from Daniel.
You know what I mean?
Hey, I have a good part of the place.
It's a hell of a fun thing.
Your website is, you know.
So I call him a while.
And so I thought he was talking about wood.
Not chill.
And I fixed it.
And he was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to me.
I don't have access to him.
I mean, just the study, so I don't know how to access to it.
No, we can't talk to each other.
Maybe we can talk about him a lot.
Normally, we can find a yet regret for that song.
Well, what?
I mean, just off from there, when he's been acting for his career.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So that's a bad song.
Like, suddenly not whatizes herfOuters,
let them go, its whatever.
Its, they use mother on the stuff you die dont.
No, I didnt.
Oh my god, get the fuck off, get the fuck off my handiwork
Kill her!!!!
idea head,
I thought I will kill you because whats a character
Deion.,
It was all about $4 an hour, which kind of ordered it.
LAUGHTER
I was at a packet box, and we were moving on.
We had a DSL state in London, Ireland, here in New York,
and let down the clock issue.
We went, let's see.
I can kind of look at the locks there.
These people want.
It is not, it's not those boxes right now.
Well, I don't even get into a set of locks.
I can, when we make a list of the last five hours,
we'll be in more servers, we can just run on the plants,
like me too.
Well, the problem is, that takes time to build up the marketplace,
and we have several suggestions from the other things.
And at the end, we haven't seen a whole lot of movement,
with the content being put up there.
For the existing side, it's there.
Somebody's got management for this.
I don't know if you want to do that.
I know you've talked about that in the past,
but you're stepping back from that.
And I know it's what you say.
Every time I make the offer, I suggest that
I play with everybody, you know,
started walking around their working,
saying, you know, commercial software.
Oh!
I talked to a little bit about it.
I didn't really like it, but,
I mean, what are we going to talk about in the original essence?
Why are you like that?
What's it about?
No, no, no, no, no.
I got a pretty license for it,
and it goes down below, down under,
and it says, last year,
software development company in Brewery.
What's the chair about?
I find it good.
Who has it?
So the next year,
why would we talk about that whole time?
Okay.
Well, I do call it plainly.
Anyway, what?
I just feel like I can't stay here.
I love what I'm telling you guys,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
She is.
Where can we have our rating party
and all the presidents of the company
and you know, I'm still a lot of people
who are interested in the president,
and these states are coming.
And then, in the end,
everybody might want to go forward and go,

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know how much it's involved, it's worth it, it's like three computers, it's probably not a big deal, but they've got nobody else to call for, they'll be calling us if something happens to one of these machines.
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

I mean, we're talking about really simple, really simple stuff.
Basically, I have a question for you.
How many of the plus people are they think I'm 90?
I think that's about it.
Yes, I think both of them in organizations are spare machinery too,
so that they can work in a whole spare machinery.
We talked about that.
They're machines right now, we're all win-32.
And so I'm not going to hand them on win-32.
I'd be happy to do that.
I have the top two best to do that.
Here is Linux, it's a little different.
Yeah.
It's a kid used to it, the type of thing.
Well, I mean, there's just a bit to be clear.
I mean, we don't have 50 years of people who are completely pure awesome.
Three, two.
I've got one phone call.
I mean, John Ross, you know, one phone call.
Yeah, I've got an email once.
So, we're not, we're not spending about two or three hours training
and 50 people getting them familiarized with the interface.
That will end up in the lower left-hand corner.
When you click on it, it should print out a mini.
You're not looking for Microsoft or you're looking for Ryder.
And we're getting them over that little pump
and we haven't had any call back.
How did that happen?
We're now at the beginning for this pre-IT app.
It's not more of this kind of model we're using for.
We've got a small non-profit group of people
that provide IT support for non-profits and people in the area.
Just to get it from Google instead.
Now, I'm happy that some of our industry,
what were stated, what part were stated earlier?
This is from Amazon.
Where is this from?
From Amazon.
Where is it from?
From Amazon?
From Amazon?
From Amazon?
From Amazon?
From Amazon?
Actually, we got out of the military.
And we didn't.
From Amazon?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
I think so.
I think so.
All right.
So, at LPC, there's lots of stuff you want to get involved.
And you will work a lot.
And a lot.
A lot of what we feel a little is that if you can buy this building,
probably you can get more in the future.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
I might have listened to it a few days earlier,
but once I was down, I could always check in on a PSA DC site.
That's why I got the idea.
Just a little bit.

We're looking for an owner because I mistakenly agree to speak at another software freedom
day in Atlanta without realizing that it was software freedom day.
Now they said, who were out of this install phase on the 20th, if you might come in and
speaking to us, it sure ought to happen to you.
And one of the guys says, don't you have something going on all the time?
No, not a thing.
Oh, yeah.
The top 20 is software freedom day.
So when you go on the website for software freedom day, you look at the map and you see
stuff going on and he said, hey, this is software freedom day.
It's something going on in this factory.
It's David Nally.
That's right.
They will be there.
They will be there.
They will be there.
That's right.
The thoughts are to either do it, not their team or someone pick up the, take this up
and run it on the point.
They're specifically going to send us a bunch of this.
They're going to send us the open CD.
They're going to send us T-shirts and things of that nature.
Who would software freedom day?
The organization's open through memory.
No, it's not.
It's not a free software definition.
It's software freedom they have out there.
Yeah.
I mean, they literally have out there on an organization this Thursday.
It seems like we did this last year as an install phase and combination FLPC event.
And we have one year 30 people that workload can be sure of.
We've also kind of created lots of running install phase, which ran install phase a few months before that.
And have a 40.50 show up.
Those days are...
I hope somebody wants to jump in and take them.
They're all for once.
And now for the main topic, which is...
About?
Almost a year ago now.
Yeah, he came back from a little shabby up in Ohio called OLLF.
And that's a bio-level expense.
And he came back and this question was, why are we doing this here?
And we talked about it a little bit.
It really new.
And we started having more discussions about it.
And so, essentially, what we're doing is we're going to do on the South East Linus Fest.
And this is hinted to believe you and hurt me.
We have thus far some very tinted, exciting speakers.
Some of them are going to write down so that they don't go out of the podcast.
But the first is Chris Obama.
He's come up with that.
He's pretty close to his name.
To sucker people into the next video, speak for him.
Oh, it didn't really make any sense.
Does everybody admit this is?
Yes.
Okay.
He's been to Greenville before.
And he knows us.
So, hopefully he's coming.
Maybe you could write down what he's known for.
We're actually...
That person's already been contacted.
But we'll wait until the final location then.
He wrote...
I'll say his name.
Yeah.
He wrote that.
This.
He wrote that.
Yes.
By the way, this is the LTHIS.
Let's see.
We are also...
Yeah.
What's very last thing?
I don't know.
Spray.
Spray for the thing.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Here is the GOR, who is a member of the GOR team.
No way.
And he is eventually coming from a heart city.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Please.
Let me do it.
We sit here to bring him.
Okay.
We can get the order.
Marically what's coming.
What else do we need?
To sit down.
Would we sit down?
Okay.
Just open up with our mind.
Okay.
And try to remember.
Okay.
That's the act.
Just like sugar.
And the other one is...
Yeah.
That's the act.
That's the act.
Just like sugar.
And the other one is...
Yeah.
Just like sugar.
Yeah.
Just like sugar.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just like sugar.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Good?
Yep.
The gelatinорот is conflated.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
That's the video.
Chris is one of the founders of Lifestyle. He was on Lost Weekly. He has lost weekly podcasts.
He was on Tech TV. He's been there.
I think that's his title.
By the way, we have tensionably, because I say so, adopted this tagline.
It's in the GNU staff.
Chris won.
We've probably surpassed himself.
Maybe now I want to be with you.
Who's the Black Lion?
I'm here.
Anyway, I'm telling you this.
We need a lot of help.
We are now in a public corporation called the Southeast Linus Fest.
We got that paperwork yesterday.
We have lots of paperwork to not buy out with the federal estate government.
We have to elect board directors.
We have to give bank accounts.
We have a start getting sponsored, because I think our local investment is around $20,000 right now.
Our minimal lowball for about 20 days.
We're looking at a minimum spend of $10,000 that we will need upfront.
You'll have to upfront a pure minimum cost of $20,000 that just for the venue itself is going to be $8,000.
So you have to front a third of that whole day.
We need $3,000 just to get a reservation.
That's one big difference.
That's one of the ones we're considering.
We're talking actively to others who may do it for free.
Or maybe it's substantially cheaper.
Or maybe it's more expensive.
But right now, we have got a process from one place.
The chances for us is that it's a little bit more of the U.S.
Public Senate.
It looks as a gathering conference center.
And the University of Senator Greenville, that's actually most of that is still about a free-filled tech corporation down.
The University of Senator Greenville has still already has the least space for them.
So that may be a minute.
The D&P, and the expert base for the sale, which is right at the intersection of I-26 and I-5,
that would cost more, but it has a monstrous capacity to put it in some price entities.
So each has a further balance.
It's Turkish.

something reserved that foreign advance of these
bid you take us equally. We need to start
advertising and they will have. Is it okay to
mention? I would go to the
go to the Wiki. It's not recently
expressed up. It's got a tour of
there. It's got our most of the
presses and the IRC laws are being
being received, which is tonight. I'm also
probably too good at you to go to those
with his laptop. This is what it
is. And I am a messy brother, not
all of us, but this you. I can read
you back. We are here just there's
somebody there, just about 24
seven. Yeah, IRC got pretty
named up that. If you don't know
about IRC, come see one of the
sectors of the U.L. pitch to come.
They certainly. They serve the
Linux-centric magazine as a
brief start advertising for us. So we've
got to develop some graphics and get
them with banners and something.
And so all this is blowing up
really, really quickly and we need
some help. The things that we need
are we need more laws to sign on. So if
you have contacts at other laws,
two big ones that we are still
waiting on are car laws. So when
it's used to the end of all this
people, can you give them a
place maybe? Could you put them
trial laws? No, we have to run
like that, Charlotte. Now try to
let us sign on with them. Here is
the most of the maintenance of the
aluminum floor of the next
community. The Logan for the day.
The Logan for the road. Logan is
the state bridge for a road, trial
road, up for a whole
road, CSC mode, which is
Charles. That's right.
Yeah, we're up for a road for the
shore road. They were at
the shore road. They were with
them and on. It's not bad. It's
not fair. It's not a race. So
it is. So having a large
load capacity does say that all
of these loads are staying behind
us. Does something for us when
we get to spend or when we get to
a place like silicon mechanics if
we went forward and said, hey,
we're with that club. We're
holding this event. We please
offer it. We probably have them
give us a very small amount of
money. If we're going with 10
loves and some of those loved
are big famous loved like
trial love and plant
analytics to do this. I think
we stand a little bit of
chance of getting some big
dollars out. So we should
move on to that. We need more
love and one of the things we're
doing is September 20th. They
engage and I are going down to
Atlanta to try to put their arms
into the office. They're having
to install this. They said, oh,
I'm sure I'll come down to
your arms while I tell you about
what you want to hear about. So
days and hours are going down
there and we're going to find
to get them to sign on and at
very least I think they will know
more about our about our
figures. We actually announced
a couple of papers. And so if
you know something cool, want to
share it? You're free to
submit a paper. No, there's no
guarantee you'll get a
speaker's button. The rate
above is also amazing. So yes,
one of them is a fifth. We can
explain that multiple tracks to
you know, there are ways for us
to handle that. At the same
time, we need sponsors. And we
don't want to go back to the
sponsors yet. We would really
like to get some of these names
carved out if we can. Because these
guys are essentially talking about
coming and doing a free
and even if it's not for free most
of those people are either
close enough or related to a
like in the bag. Probably sponsor
or so. So it's so private.
Okay, next up, we want to
want to get some of these guys
up for sponsors.
John, I made your entire
publishing companies. So we're
probably going to hit you up to
cut that down.
But if you know anything, you have to
do this and you know how to get
back to doing the part
of the trade-offs around the
world.
Have a look on what you're doing,
so they said, okay,
we'll go around.
propose a book.
Actually, there are a lot of
tracks, so we need to actually
do all of that. So, I hope you
did any paintball.
You know,
well, just be nice.
Just be honest.
Most people, you know, people get
a list of guidelines and
say, let's do it.
I mean, I review that twice,
any young,
head full reviewer,
John here. But
anyway, you know, if you want to
say, instead of paying the
average budget YouTube, then
you take a number of dollars,
a number of books, and
eggs, all of them.
All of them.
Okay, guys.
You know, as I let you,
head full of the top of the
property, you know, I mean, I
think I get some
conversations with the folks in
download one.
They were interesting.
I mean, it's like anything else,
one of the first things I
put into the challenge is just
if it's just getting to be
attendance.
So, I know there's a lot of people
who are using it, but
getting folks to show up
after hours after pulling
the whole night.
Yeah.
You know,
you're like, okay?
Kids,
soccer,
I don't know.
John, you just
don't know what to do with that
dress, so
you know.
But, I get to show up for
some
little talk about it.
Sure, I said that,
and I think we will make you
commit those people
on that page.
Um,
we're hoping to do a similar
model to one of the
webinars, which is,
if you want to count,
if you can prefer it,
we would appreciate
if you would grab a
$65
registration fee,
which is optional,
but for that $65
registration fee,
we'll give you a T-shirt
for a new color.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
And, um,
and it buys you to an
after-a-met part,
which is what I love that.
I like to love reading
or excuse this game.
The name is,
and we're going to need
something like that.
So, essentially,
we want it to be a
different community.
We're not hardening.
We're not actively
hardening the
business community.
We're talking
we're hardening the user.
We're actively
not hardening the industry.
Uh, um,
I want to say that before,
because, uh,
we, we, we, we will,
we will advise anybody
with money.
Listen to that happen.
I'm not going to have to
do that.
Let me clarify.
The goal is not to
come commercial.
That's right.
We don't want to be
a ministerial.
We don't want to be a, um,
seedbed or
any of the other judges that
potentially come.
Go get your slide.
And, um, um,
get counted by, um,
like cell cubes for three
months.
They're after,
and hopes that they can sell
something.
We want this to be very
much a community.
So, they're planning
the experience,
the chance to interact with
people that you may
talk to on IRC,
but I've never met.
People that you read
about in this,
you don't know
about a South cap.
And,
have a good time
to make money.
Have a good time.
They're going to be.
That is it.
We're having meetings
tonight.
Not a lot.
We'll have a wireless
network instead of it
wherever we have to be.
And, uh,
we'd welcome you to join us
Tuesdays.
Not the M. Easter.
Or our fees.
There's a mailing list
set up.
Sami,
let me test.com.
It's.org too.
I think that we'll
re-write to them.
So, you can get there.
There's a waiting there.
There's a
appointment that means
somebody to start
farming the waiting.
We're going to need
somebody to
develop websites.
We're going to need
a lot of work.
So, please get involved.
Yes.
If I'm interested to possibly
go into this show,
you'd be like a sign-up page
or anything like that.
There is an increase.
By the way, the basis five,
five-dollar question plan.
I mean, really just working
for a breakdown.
One of the things that we're
trying to do to help
get some of the big sponsors
and to say,
we've already got
x-number of people
signed up
who have committed to come.
And so, on the week,
or on the websites,
there is a
scheduling sign-up
so that we can add your name
to the number.
And don't worry,
we are developing a box
that will be
this automatically
for you to run through it on.
But,
in the interim,
we want some of the
different numbers to show.
Some of these sponsors
that a year in advance,
we can still
show some significant numbers.
Give me an idea of what we're looking for.
So, high-oiletic stress
head, the 350 people
showed their first year.
We really want 500.
Jeremy really wants the house
of our board.
I would be,
I would be a static
if I kind of spurred
for reading all this name
in this box.
Yeah, yeah.
If we get it,
if we get it,
the difference in this person
and this person,
if we don't have 500 people,
I'll be despondent.
We've got,
on the 6th, 8th,
loads of different times,
we don't have the day
with you,
we'll have a day
with these companies.
And, in the daze,
you'll have the
thing you did with the
third year.
We gave the day
to political cmd
amongst style and combat
and we every
make some
paintings from
their methods to play
with the咿lemon.
And right now,
we're going to
about Japanese
space
governed.
If there's probably
people there
who really keeps
in this area,
they're below Japanese
level entier of
being the
pretender.
Yes, Yes.
This
people know
that it's our
The first public advertisement we have for this event was from a guy in Canada.
Chris Dupinam, who lamented the loss of ALS in Atlanta.
The Atlanta Living Shipcase, I apologize.
It's talking about things before no time.
He lamented the loss of Atlanta Living Shipcase.
And this guy can't resist, hey, you're obviously not listening to the right podcast.
Yeah, it's not something that's talking about.
For now, I'm going to talk to you about what it says.
Just up the road to Atlanta.
His podcast is all about Linux, Linux.com.
And it's not like you're going to get something together.
So I just went to that.
Jeremy, they did business, say, on Christmas, and blog, through his comments.
There's something similar.
And all of a sudden, Chris is saying, oh, well, I should be coming to that.
So a lot of people know about this event.
And we're starting to get out.
And we can tell because it's going to blow up.
And we'll have more work in the possibly.
But it's not impossible.
The hell is this in the procedure now.
And it's in essence, it's going to be on bad roads.
And you know, how that's the core team.
And the day of the event, the new model.
Yeah.
But it's a lot of work for a year and a half or a month.
The week needs to end.
But it's not an underworld site.
Not carry a link.
It's based on a little bit.
Made to it.
With a smaller group.
And they do that.
I was like, five votes.
And I heard the first best one.
It was just a gathering of those loves.
It was very exciting.
It was amazing.
And now I think about a third of the event.
1500 people show up.
And it's awesome.
It's fantastic.
It's still a response.
Yeah.
We're not over shooting.
I'm looking at the world that they did.
It's been pretty year to do it.
We're hoping the largest in their mistakes.

Yeah.
bodies and you know somebody see something everyone in charge of it immediately I'll tell you the
media is we need somebody you can handle a little bit of the paperwork if we've got to pass the other day
with the state we've got to do with the federal government and then we've got to we've got to get a
penny capture so that's our that's what it might be we've got a point of order
of directors and so you have no other place you have to handle it
yeah just uh... if you were off and this is off I heard a lot of you know I'm here
you'll hear it or current what it's usually correct yeah I will say that we're
elected to that but that is certainly our probably our four-on-ones here
okay well what I heard my first of all that seems to be important and I heard a
man who had talked about this so I'm saying what he may want to consider at the end of the
few little ones such what I want but I'm sure they are and what is it and then at the same time
I think we worked out some of these groups that you've all heard so that's what I'm going to share
I'm sort of a thing we need to tackle that part of the problem is I don't know if we would have a huge straw outside of our area
I think we would do great in the upstate wrong people for that I don't think we're going to be able from
Charlotte or Tennessee etc there are people who come to see this country from Tennessee but if you don't know
who that person is why would you show up he's just a man and so I think to a degree we'll certainly have
this one of one session I don't know if that will be our main focus simply because we've got to we've
got to return something to these people who are painfully come talk for the sponsors and that's
going to be the people in this community but we certainly have some one of one session and we'll
probably be targets of people from a lot of the day one of one session because that may want to
see for a pathway I think it's successful even when we're ready to put the high ones in here
as far as you can it's not as good as that it's really something bigger for a free break to show
that it's just curious why it's so big it's you will probably have not run somehow
how are you going to make sure that you won't be allowed to read it I have full of it
read it go ahead read I'm going to write what you see okay tell me what's best and you need
that anyone who has heard more about things and freedom of law for their hard educational
conference part so yeah I know my siblings itself and it's shared with the tenies of all
skills the biggest ideas and so if you miss something.
If you have what you see the goal of serve Gilás here
the issue temporarily
and we're going to try out a few and tell people about it and also recruit speakers, because
a few security managers are going to be there and the bells community managers are going to be there.
The doors community managers are going to be there and three of their community managers.
So there are going to be some significant people there that we're going to try recruit and tell them.
And we're going to try and talk about the key of attendees as well.
I'm going to Lisa and I'm going to you call those for conference.
I'm going to try the same thing there.
There are many other cons I don't know about.
So we would like to get somebody anything that's keyed close to the southeast.
If you go on your con, we'll be stuck with freshers.
Can you visit as far as we can?
We'll be pretty busy.
Can you put some time to pay the bill?

By the way, everybody on the top cast will have a land.
That's the stage in that Han Harini division.
Yeah, I think.
I still forgot if it's Microsoft Or Qual.
Oh, by the way?
That's a high line ball.
That's a ball.
stored in the uh...
So good.
This will be a fun event.
We got to find the arm czar, the doll, and everything like that.
So we can kind of never set up kind of like the outcome.
So we wanted that word set up.
Why is it a little bit friendlier than the way it comes?
You have to locate your knot in a different hotel.
Court dolls in a chain working flipper with an arm czar and a doll.
That's saying something like that.
There's a little arm czar.
And I want them to take down some of these people for that one.
They're a real member of the community.
A lot of stuff.
People have been joined around this.
Join the Irish and Camel.
Look at the wiki.
We're going to start getting expand via the salon.
It should be a pretty preparatory.
If nothing else sign up to say that you might just end.
Sign up.
Yeah, please.
Sign up in the first set.
We get three of them.
And I don't think so.
I do what you can read down for telling people about it.
Wrong.
