In speaking of enslaving humanity, I don't know if anybody has seen, was it war for the
planet of the Apes who watched it yesterday?
Yeah, the first two I thought were good.
The war for the planet of the Apes was awful.
Once they have to come up with more derivatives and it was like war for the planet of the
possibility of the people of the planets and now the galaxies.
It's getting a bit long in the tooth.
What the heck, there was a 2001 plan of the Apes?
Yeah, I think that's where they started with the remakes.
I thought they started with the guy in the zoo and his father.
What was the guy's the actor?
He was on 3rd rock.
No idea.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I can't see his face.
I can't remember his name.
You would think with all these internet, we would be able to come up with this information on the quick on the fly.
I was rolling down on something else.
Was it John Lithgow?
Yeah, yeah.
So Harry and the Henderson's.
Right.
Yeah, that was a good movie.
So 2014, there's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
John Lithgow's best role was in 3rd rock.
I thought he did a good job in the Dexter series as an evil one.
Oh, I forgot about that.
Yeah, that was good too.
Because he was the ultimate, the ultimate challenge, the ultimate hunt for the Dexter.
So Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes were good.
Go on.
I have no idea.
I'm just looking at this Planet of the Apes of 2001.
It looks like the 1960s remake because Air Force astronaut crash lands on mysterious Planet of all blah, blah, blah.
So that looks like just a rehash of the 1960s one.
And I don't know if that fits in the same timeline.
But Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes were good.
And I have no idea who this is.
Director Rupert Wyatt and I thought it was a good movie.
Thanks to Director Rupert Wyatt out there on your blue marble.
And Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 2014 was Matt Reeves, the director.
As long as it wasn't Brian Singer, I think I think we're safe.
Okay, so I didn't realize one of the main characters in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was the same guy from Terminator Genesis, John Connor.
Okay, Wesher says that he has a good part.
I am assuming we were talking about John Lithgow that he has a good part on the crown on Netflix.
Was he played Churchill or something?
Plates Churchill, exactly.
Sorry.
What's on frame though?
Was that side casted?
Geez.
Fiddy, Fiddy won Fiddy in the house.
We can hear you, buddy.
Turn his headphones up.
We can hear the music.
Turn, turn.
Somebody turn Fiddy one Fiddy's headphones up.
Come on.
Come on.
First time caller.
Long time listener.
Just reading what K-Wisher is texting.
And if you're just joining us, you're Hacker Public Radio.
Thanks to Josh from Ananas Host for making it all possible.
Thanks to Ken Fallon, who is leaving us unattended, leaving the aliens to bounce around in this bouncy castle.
Or it is IMDB more and more useless.
Yes.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
It's kind of gotten worse at least.
I mean, in other words, I have to pay for IMDB to find out, you know, Jason Clark what movie he's been in.
It's worse than that line, Rich.
They got rid of all the comments.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I wonder why.
There are shills just like Rotten Tomatoes.
By the Bing, by the boom.
I think you got it.
Another sole purpose is just to sell movies and notice an extension of the movie generation business.
So of course there's already that.
Here's how much does it cost you to go to the movies?
Because forget about transportation costs, just immediately what you pay once you enter the box office.
So you've got the costs.
It might be 15, 18 bucks to see a movie.
If you get a soda and popcorn, that could be another 15 or 20 bucks.
And that's just for one person.
Now, if you take a family of three or four or, you know, like Dan Washco, I don't know how many, you know, of his kids he's taken to the movies when he goes or buys a babysitter.
And I mean, it's a, it's got to be over a hundred bucks to go to the movies.
So if you're going to be forked over that kind of money, it's, I hate say, if they gave me some sort of guarantee money back guarantee, then I would go.
I, I wouldn't want the guarantee on the popcorn, but I, I'd want at least a, this movie sucked to come back and see a free movie on us.
I would go to, I would take more chances at the movie saying.
But after, I would be completely angry if I took my wife and daughter out to see the third planet of the apes movie that we, we just couldn't really, it's moving crazy slow.
What is this going to take off? Boy, this did nothing.
And if I spend, you know, 60 bucks for all of us to go to movies have popcorn, I would be incredibly mad.
It's the lowest year this year for seats in the theaters for 22 years.
So I think everyone's figured it out.
And I can, well, I read Ben Shapiro's review of the Force Awakens.
And I'm like, crap, I'm not going to see that movie.
Yeah.
I'll, you know, if it comes out on, you know, if I can pay two bucks at red box or, you know, watch it on Amazon for $2.99 or if it comes for free on Netflix, I'll watch it.
But I'm not going to theater for that.
Yeah.
There was a, I posted a link here.
I was aware of a, like a movie past type of thing that were, were getting hit too.
And they, they were like, oh, all right.
I'm finally getting, getting back out to the movies.
All right. This is good.
And then I believe that they canceled it.
No, why sticking.
Because I heard the guy on, he was on Glenn Beck's show.
And they're talking about that because apparently Glenn Beck likes to go the movies a lot.
I'm trying to do a little bit, a little bit of research here.
But I did hear that they shut that thing down because it was probably too successful and was probably not giving the media industrial complex their proper cash stream that they wanted.
Well, the thing that's very frustrating is you can legally go to Hong Kong.
And this, this is more true, you know, 10, 15 years ago back when people were buying movies on disk as opposed to streaming them.
You could go to Hong Kong and buy any movie you wanted for a dollar.
But here it's, you know, always 20 plus dollars and they say it's the packaging.
I'm like, you're telling me because I don't get a white box.
I'm like, send me the disk in a plastic sleeve.
You know, I mean, like a garbage.
I'm ziplock bag sleeve.
I'm okay with that.
I don't need the pretty box.
And if they had an option like that in the United States,
and I think there's a lot of things about the United States.
We expect things to be packaged a certain way.
And I think they believe they can sell to us for a premium.
It's basically what the market bears.
The, for instance, is I had a buddy that had a vet clinic that was doing real good.
And some company made an offer to buy him out.
And he sold the vet clinic.
And he was still part of the contract was for, I don't know, year or two.
He still had to work there a couple days a week.
And somebody came in to get their cat, I don't know, spade neutered.
And, you know, the week before it was 20 bucks.
And now it's like 120 bucks.
And he's like, hold on, let me look this up.
And he goes into the computer.
And then he finds out he talks to the company that bought him.
And they're like, oh, yeah, well, we did a study figured out what the market could bear.
And that's the price for this neighborhood.
And I think a lot of that happens in the United States, like our price of drugs.
I was in Costa Rica.
And they would, they would actually sell you by the pill.
So I was looking for, what do you take for C-Sickness?
What's it called?
Drame.
Drame in the United States for a box of, I don't know how many pills, you know, whatever the box is.
It's like 20 or 30 bucks.
There it's like two bucks.
It was dramatically different for the whole box.
Can you guys hear me now?
Yes.
Okay.
I don't know what was wrong with a bunch of settings.
Yeah, well, Rich, that also works for agricultural chemicals.
And I can, I can see, yeah, Monsanto does a lot, puts a lot of money into research.
And, you know, make a profit, they need to get that money back.
But, you know, secondary world markets, stuff like that, Mexico, even a certain extent in Australia.
They say, these guys can't pay the purchase price, you know, the research price.
So they charge them on the production price, you know, in other words.
So they take the research out of it.
They say, you know, a ton of this chemical cost is much reduced.
Then we will, you know, we will, we will add a profit onto that.
And the, you know, all of the research costs gets charged to Americans.
And that's, you know, that's the same way in the field industry.
That's a bullshit argument though.
Can I say that?
And again, that's wealth redistribution because basically with the United States or financing all of the research and development of these new products,
and the rest of the world gets them for the production costs where we're paying the, you know, full market value of it.
It's a rent seeking on the corporations behalf.
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm capitalist like anybody else, but what they're doing is they're taking a fixed, fixed cost of doing business and trying to use that as a skewed for raising prices on, on a certain area.
Well, there, there have been some outrageous crimes as far as I'm concerned.
What, what was it?
What do you take when you have anaphylactic shock?
And they raise the rate of that.
Epinephrine.
Epinephrine, they raised it.
The epipan, that's it.
To, you know, like 200% or 200 times, I should say.
The problem, part of the problem is patenting like the epipan, epinephrine is not a patentable drug at this point.
But the delivery method is, is patentable and there's so much regulation involved with that, especially after the taxes involved with Obamacare on device,
medical devices that I'm sure that had something to do with it.
And that was why, why would they go for if you want to make healthcare available to the people and if it was a truly genuine effort, why would you have a tax on medical devices?
Because that's one of the things that delivers healthcare to people.
They need to make the cut.
You know, it's, it's, maybe somebody just has a, has a better lobbying firm, you know, that that's about it.
Aliens believe that to be true.
Who has the most lobbyists who, who is actually pulling the string, so to speak.
We're looking down and we, we see that it's all lobbyists, CFR.
They're, the politicians are doing you no good.
We don't understand why that they're still there and, you know, giving you double speak all that crap.
Well, and I'll not to derail this.
Another place this might go is military acquisitions.
And I'm, you know, I'm actually on the other side of that on this one.
My dad was an officer in the Air Force Reserve.
He saw some, how some of this worked.
You know, first off in these last few decades, you know, you get somebody like a locky to, to research the development of the F-22.
Expecting to sell 1,500 of the things.
And, you know, come back, you know, delays, delays, delays by Congress.
20 years later, it's almost obsolete.
They say, yeah, that, that's great work.
We'll take 50 of them.
That's why, you know, an aircraft is a hundred million dollars instead of 15 or well, 35 million dollars.
The F-35 was to solve that because the F-35 was going to be so much cheaper than the F-22.
And see that again.
How did that reduce problems?
Like a seven five in the space shuttle.
You are making, to do that, you're making the Air Force and the Navy take the same version of the same aircraft.
We had that before.
The F-17 would have been the Air Force version of the F-18.
The difference being it was, you know, it was not designed to slam itself repeatedly down on a carrier.
So it didn't have to be built like a dang truck.
I mean, that's why an F-14 and F-15 looked the same.
But an F-14 is just fast. It's not maneuverable.
That fifth would blow it out of the sky.
You know, because it's the F-14 has to be built heavy like a truck to land on a carrier.
So you are, you know, so F-35 project.
You're crippling the land-based forces just so you can say, hey, we have the same parts inventory for both versions.
That's a, I think a lot of sense.
The military stuff is a fact.
It's an obscenity.
Meaning that there's multiple inputs for a single customer.
And I know there's more than one branch military in the U.S., but it's essentially the same thing.
It's a government customer.
Well, yeah, the problem, first of all, there's multiple different problems.
And I remember when the F-18 was going through Congress and how Congress was designing the F-18.
I'm like, you guys are out of your freaking mind.
You need to let the brightest and the best people deal with these situations and, you know, walk away from it.
And you can't legislate a top performing aircraft.
And, you know, just the same way I have a sports car in a truck and my wife has a four-door sedan.
Each fill a different role.
So if you want to take off vertically or you want to land on an aircraft carrier or you're land-based,
those are substantially different aircraft.
You can't, you know, if you're going to put everything in the same frame, you're horrifically wasting things.
And unfortunately, aircraft, just like a bird, you know, a bird's digestive system has to be so simple, so fast that it just gets rid of the stuff as quick as possible.
Its bones have to be hollow.
Everything about the bird is designed to be lightweight because it's all critically important that it flies.
You know, same thing with an airplane.
You can't just say, well, you know, we're going to make this airplane, you know, the best air superiority fighter take off vertically and land on a carrier.
And it's like, no, no, no, those three don't intersect.
Right. And it also explains, you know, your $10,000 toilets and your $1,000 hammer and stuff like that.
Now, a lot of times, because you're not ace hardware and you're not selling $100,000 of that hammer a year.
You know, something is specially made, but part of it is it's also advertising the cost of the entire aircraft.
You know, you're high, you're hiding bits and pieces of it to make the aircraft look cheaper.
So you're saying I can give you an airplane for $10,000 if you buy the $50,000 hammer?
Something like that. Yes. Well, just like I can, I can sell you a printer for $15 if you pay me $15 for ink cartridges.
You're $50 for ink cartridges.
Yeah, Joel announced, you know, they got a new printer and I look it up and I'm like, yeah, the ink is just as much as the printer.
On that note, I just bought a new to me HP color laser jet for 25 bucks.
Dude, where'd you get that score? That's amazing.
Our local goodwill.
Oh my gosh. It still has all four, all four toners.
I think the lowest one is red and it's got an estimated life of another 800 pages before I have to replace it.
Darn. And those toner cartridges is you probably can refill.
No, but four of them a complete reset will be only $69 on Amazon for it.
Wow. So I have, I bought for 50 bucks. I don't know how many years ago. I'm probably more than 10.
HP laser jet five. I have only replaced the cartridge like earlier this year.
Now, not one I virtually never print to the, I think the cartridge is only 10 or 15 bucks.
You know, it's super cheap.
And I'm just shocked at, you know, the, now I, there are ink jets that have refillable things now.
I haven't really looked into that because I just hating chat with the passion. It just, you know, really salted the earth for me.
So I just don't want to go there.
Well, Ken found he did the thing on a real interesting kid he bought all is on an HP are probably four years ago.
But he has like, he's got his converter to these big huge external tanks, you know, full full full of toner.
I mean, like, you know, quarter to courts or something like that per tanks that they're next to the printer.
That never run, you know, or use four more in when they run out.
So, and he really liked that setup.
That's called bulk bulk ink jet.
The problem with this printer was that I've got hooked up to my Windows 10 machine. I know, I know.
And I want to be all print to everything else on the network.
And they've done the drivers for it because it was originally a consumer level product from HP.
They don't have the ability to share the printer, which is lame.
So I got a Raspberry Pi 3 and I'm happily serving you up.
Nice.
As well as Pi Hole and Pi Hole was beautiful.
I don't know. I didn't, as much as I like Pi Hole, I don't find it too useful because there's so many sites that don't want you to block them.
They don't know.
Yeah, I always get it. You mean the new Pi Hole because I was even getting it with the Pi Hole.
It's like you have an ad blocker.
No, I've not gotten that at all yet.
I used to get it. I used to have a micro blocker or whatever it was.
You block origin.
And I get that warning, you know, in the wild wallpaper and rest of that.
But I'm not getting any of that.
Huh.
What's a good site? Let me let me test it real quick.
I see it in through that era up.
You know, a lot of new sites through that era.
It's funny. I got it today.
You know where this crap so much. It's ridiculous.
But if you go to Georgia Port and click through a couple of the top headlines, you'd probably hit it.
Yeah, and I guess we just went through a time zone here.
So greetings to Pakistan, Dashkint, Islamabad.
That's a city. So why are we, that's not a country.
Lahore, well in Karachi, that's also a city.
Yeah.
And you said it wrong. It's
Pakistan.
I don't want to start a war right now, Rich. Thank you.
We do not want war. We want peace. We want a ministry of peace.
No, the one thing I could do without in my HP inkjet, I don't print that much.
I mean, tanks, 800 copies, that that would probably 800 pages.
That would probably get me through my life.
But I could do without the sensor that knows when I have to print something out.
And I have to be there right now with it.
Like on my way to Walmart to pick up something on the pickup desk or on my way to the airport.
And I want to print out my flight information.
I'm fine, Rich. I'm looking on, I guess, Georgia Port just to find new sites.

It seems to be 100% electronically compatible with the Pine64,
which has a plethora of distros available.
So you just go to the Pine64 page and pick an image.
Okay, I'm here now.
Okay, I'm here now.
I had no idea because as much as even with the crappy trackpad,
if it worked decent, and again,
my only uses of it were to maybe send receive email,
Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon and plaques as my four video sources,
if that's all I need a device to do.
I, I, yeah, I did Pine Book.
I forgot about that.
But yeah, that's interesting.
Plus, something you want me to pull you to,
whatever we're going back on here before as well.
But yeah, for basic laptop, that'd be quite good, I guess.
Well, I mainly keep it, you know,
as my travel computer,
because if they lose the bag, I don't care that much, I guess,
as opposed to, you know, my, yeah.
My Chromebook would probably make a better travel computer,
it's definitely tougher with the aluminum case,
and faster because it's Intel.
But, you know, I'd hate, I'd hate to lose it,
even though I got, even though I got in a raffle,
it's still $400 to replace the thing,
where, of course, you could make that same argument,
you know, five-year-old laptop off eBay or something.
In fact, I bought a laptop that's a nice series
that is fact that is, you know, was cheaper than the Chromebook.
Uh, or no, I guess it was a dual, wasn't nice series,
it was a dual core at least, with a graphics accelerator.
So that would be another way to go,
but of course, that's that much more weight in your bag,
whereas the, the, uh,
the Pinebook, uh, it, uh, you know, no way at all.
Now, one thing I will tell you,
you go through, uh, checkpoint TSA is going to take,
you know, when they x-ray that thing,
and they see if there's nothing in the box,
they're going to take it out and do the rub down and all that stuff,
you know, because they don't know what that thing is,
and it's freaks them out.
Ah, yeah, okay, I've never traveled with it,
so I had no idea.
All right, so firing up my Pinebook now for the first time
in probably weeks or more than a month,
um, where, do you have a link where the OSs are that you found
that work good?
Because I drilled down Pine64 and resources,
and all I can find is Android.
Okay, uh, I shouldn't take too long,
I think it's in there wiki.
Right, so, um, another good,
very nice traveling computer,
and I've got one now,
is the, uh, GPD pocket,
seven inch, well, the crowdfunded that,
funded that this year,
where it came with a Windows 10,
when it was crowdfunded,
it came with the options of Windows 10,
preinstalled, or Ubuntu,
and I got mine a bit later on,
because not having money to get that,
plus, at the time,
but anyway, I'm,
I've had,
not any Zelda Windows 10 version,
but you can put a bunch one there yourself,
be that the GPD version,
or the community version,
so Ubuntu 16.04 was GPD,
community pride things like this,
uh, Ubuntu 17.04,
and there's even a mint version,
and there was a,
things an absolute,
the, the base distro,
manual, what was it called?
Mandru, what was it called?
And I'm,
that's from the vices I have on my,
to do this, so set up properly,
um, with Linux,
when I,
when I do that,
oh, that's good.
That's good.
That's good.
That's my, uh,
Xperia X,
which in my now,
I've got Sailfish OS,
that I'm removing Android,
I've got this phone,
and putting Sailfish OS,
on there,
and that's why I bought this phone
in the first place so that's and I'm setting up a laptop as well which I got back recently
with new motherboard but unfortunately as I was hoping to put Linux on it last night
uh starting with the uh button E1650, HTTPS colon slash slashforum.pine64.org slashforumdysplay.php
starting with the Ubuntu 16.04 it did not install on from two USB sticks, got grabbed and
that gives black screens and why that is a bit strange to me as we know it's a stable secure boot
and I'm thinking was it something else I had to disable in the BIOS as well as something
because I can't remember quite been a while but yeah you know you wouldn't put Linux on your laptops
but we stuck with Windows because of silly reasons and that one can actually run Linux so
so Fiddy which uh which OS did you go with DBN Ubuntu, Armbian, Arch, Open Suicy?
Pretty sure version of Debian. So the pint 64 I kind of forgot about that or
or overlooked it all you know it came back in mind or whatever but um I think that's
thing I read about really was that at least a few months back I believe or something like that
they were going to crowdfund it so I guess it's been actually sold now properly um so is it just
still like is it just ready for general sale now just going by one off the website or something?
Well they were doing batch builds uh I don't know if they're still doing the how they're doing that
so if you order it there's going to be a batch built you know once they fulfill the requirement
for the batch you know have payments and then they build the batch and then deliver it so it's not
like you're going to get it overnight or anything like that and I that may have changed so don't
don't let me talk authoritative on that because I don't know if things have changed that's when I
got it that's how it was. Yeah special batch I guess because there's only don't like much for them
for these not like many people know about them I suppose but also isn't it isn't it really very
similar to sort of having a raspberry pie but in the laptop obviously it's not about the pie but
I'll tell you what I the the keyboard if it e chime in and let me know where I am but I think the
biggest downside on it is the trackpad the trackpad uh it has a precision that's so a bore I mean
it's just horrible. Keyboard I think is fine I think the display is fine for a hundred bucks uh for
the keyboard display alone I would say you got really superior quality just for that cost forget
about the battery or the board or anything you know the CPU on it uh if the trackpad was better
like if they give you a $20 option to upgrade the trackpad I'd be all into it. Yeah the track
that is dismal and the even more disappointing are the speakers they're just oh I've said this you
know they're they're not fit for purpose to hear anything at all doesn't matter what operating
system it is uh you go in operating system and and you raise the speaker volume all the way and
if there's a separate sound manager you go in there and raise it all the way and on Linux you go
and also manager raise it all the way and you you still you know if you're if you want to play
YouTube video you're going to be sitting there straining to hear it. That's right. It's not like you
could do do YouTube and send an email at the same time or something or or read because you
it's so low you got to totally concentrate to hear it. So those little boards look like they're
pretty good though I think I can give it ethernet looks like oh yeah I the pine you know as a the
pine boards as products are really good I don't have any doors to walk them up so uh I trust
store on that I they must be good. I pine 64 value pies all this kind of stuff I've also got a deep
I've got a pocket chip and then a two chips as well but the pocket chip is quite a uh
it's a massive uh that'd be in base device so you also have done that much with mine to be fed but
yeah it couldn't isn't it's double your mom so it can run with some of the room programs room
interface um it was very cheap it was crowdfunded it was like a ninety nine dollar PC basically a
computer um and I think he's by by them now really but that's that's my most uh programs as long
as they've been ported to arm under dabby and so yeah I could do more with mine really
saying the wireless sub-pizzle a little bit complicated I read or the Bluetooth but
again that can be done as well yeah I have to admit that I kind of borked mine up uh
and have not found there's no really easy factory reset on it it can be done
but I think it's connected to a windows pc and do this and do that and do the other thing
which I haven't done yet but what I did I was listening to
lyle on the urandom podcast and uh hit set his up his network diagnosed diagnostic
and he got uh he reminded me that uh listen to that actually you know it's actually running
dabby and it's got this unique interface it's only got links to its four or five programs that
thinks you need to run uh plus a terminal but uh you know said well yeah you just go to the terminal
do apt get lxt run lxt on it so I did that got lxt found out yeah you install lxt but doesn't
bring over any of the already installed applications or any of the applications you would think would
be with lxt so I've got no command interpreter and uh and I've got no uh uh uh no installer no
no app manager so there's you know all i've got sell it's lxt at this top and nothing else now
while did recently did mention ssh in the his like that I'd completely forgot about
i'm pretty sure ssh server is is enabled so i'll have to i'll have to try that see if i can get
it in a back way and it's at install software um yeah i mean the dp pocket uh the thing is
that i did read somewhere that actually yeah okay it's all about the the pre install interface
and the the few programs it comes with and then like you just said you've got the terminal
it's all five Fox and Marisa the things and launch it from the terminal of course but
i did read somewhere that you can also actually add your own icons onto the dp pocket via the
programs that you installed and and uh also because i don't listen to that many of these podcasts
and so on i'm just wondering who Lyle is look does that come from i just said yeah can you repeat
that last part and also because i don't listen to that many of these podcasts and so on i'm
wondering who Lyle is uh well it's it's you random dot info i believe altered up real quick
it's uh pokie and Taj and Lyle who his screen name is x 11 oh one you probably wouldn't
hurt him except on the hbr book review podcast
yes no i haven't had has a thing then i've also any puffy ads or so if he doesn't on these things
yes you random dash podcast dash info okay so it's another podcast right
yeah it's not necessarily a tech or a linux centric podcast the way that uh uh
uh you know tilts would be or whatever it's you know it's it's three linux
guys sitting around talking about life is essentially what stuff they've done so some of it's
some of its tech some of its popular media talking about movies music whatever
so it's just like you know any of us sat down had a conference at a table and we're just talking
but not talking about linux right yeah uh right yeah what would you say it was cool again
yeah it's you random like the linux command you random dash podcast dot info and i'm putting it
in i'm going in to the chat 51 50 you wonder my why might have had or maybe not but um also uh
we've got a nice bottom there but um yeah we didn't we didn't have a woman on there anyway
it's not gonna happen there is it might do yeah i i went in and turned down the volume on my
notifications i don't know why it's still coming through for mumble i guess but i'm unplumble
today and instead first time the free version of the app for android and the actual mumble which
i did actually install first even though i kind of looked them for is that right right back
is that really mumble um doesn't quite mumble else he do you ever said and that's something else but
so maybe that's why it's called plumble and uh handrodden's tag because a name issue would yet
i don't know or any idea what it's called plumble and android otherwise
well uh it's not from the regular mumble people so it's somebody wrote it wrote it
right i kind of thought we'd get together that as well but the actual mumble
acted sort of popped up in the place or wasn't even mumble you know that was that was something else
it's like you can do it you can mumble you can do some mumbling um and in plumble free i
is the other one that popped up i look at this before and you have to you sort of hope or try
have to try and trust these apps that they're not malicious but there's nothing to balance
i don't know you have to trust the app store with these things at least with some cream like
um christia i i r c plumble is the free version
niste uh like there's something like a banner you typed i think the app that was
not sure it was a lot easier to trust really that it was one proof of concept
so this could have been manual i think they got through better than that
there's just two that's a good point i'm making actually there's just too many apps and android
and all and all the other things windows even these days uh iphone you have to trust that
those apps that you're actually installing are secure or or enough so
and the other thing that got me about android is how every app wants access to all the file
missions it's imposed like you know apparently but but um but yeah i didn't have like that my android
but well i think i've been using plumble as my remote app uh for about three years now well
when i got not when i had that fire and then the one way to get on was with uh uh my android phone
that would that would have been about three years ago and and i well i wasn't even an early adopter
then other people have been using plumble so yeah it's if anybody would ask me i'd say that's a fairly
trust or the app if something was going to go if something was untoward about it uh the community
would have noticed by now yeah yeah i guess but um i wonder about next year or seven when i actually
what i think i'm not an android phone anyway but uh when i you know when i got cell fish on here
don't know well no actually no actually one one but that should be able to run these things as well
because it can run there's lots of android apps as well so i guess i could use it on there as well
and uh have you got any more devices 51 because about a year ago when i last talked to you
which were which wasn't this uh well yeah whole year has been by so have you got any other
interesting tech devices since then sure you do because you don't have loads of stuff as well
yeah i don't know about unique because i've put
bit up a couple more uh maybe three more in the last year Raspberry Pi 3s i don't think i had any
3s last year but uh the reason for that playing around with the uh you know the home assistant
devices and yes i know the whole argument that that you're giving the NSA a microphone directly
into your house i acknowledge that and this is more
experimenting because i really hadn't got around sitting anything up and uh then at uh
uh black well i did i did i have had my uh micro offsetting here in certain way for it to mature but uh
uh you know black friday sale they had they had uh that walmart 25 dollar uh google home mini so i
grabbed a couple of those with that price because it's cheaper and i can actually build a thing
but have not really i mean they're fine there's a novelty to talk to or whatever but uh
you know any real utility i have not found a sweet spot for that yet
dude i don't know if you saw my the video on youtube i posted about 2017 wins and fails hold on i
do have my outline let me grab that okay so i'll tell you uh my little google home it has some use
i've had uh uh the amazon dot for a while and the google home just beats the pants off of it for
just getting info okay so the here's my bullet points on the google home and i have uh 50
have you been keep it up on my youtube channel or i'm assuming the dead air was a no
well i can't think of anything in particular did you off so okay uh with the google home let me
just run through this the the big win for me uh with home automation assistant and if in google
home is every all the lights that i have running on home automation assistant are now voice controlled
the bitch is you got to do the on and the off config and ifte so that that's the only pain um
so let's see where's my google home okay i've got the google home mini and i got it at best by
and i think it was like twenty nine dollars and they give you a ten dollar gift card
it's actually a superior speaker i i was shocked because for the bird i usually
i have a galaxy s3 next to the bird and i usually play talk radio for
and better audio quality on it i don't have the f with the ui i can just tell it to play
something for the bird and i i'm just shocked at the audio quality out of that cheapy
and the the google home full size which is i don't know two three times the price is supposed to
sound even better but um another big win uh because there's three of us in the house is the shared
shopping list so as you're doing things in the kitchen you can just say hey uh you know add this to
the list hey g you know add you know whatever eggs to the list that kind of thing uh i did mention this
already so music for the bird uh so i could just walk out of the house or as i'm walking out i can
just say hey play this and boom it plays something for the bird chrome cast control so what
we do a lot of the time is we tell it to play a video of a fireplace so it turns on tv because
if you configure your hdmi port for whatever standard it's you usually have if you have a smart tv
it has it in the menu and you can configure basically tv wakes on you know like wake online basically
it wakes on you know device playing um cooking timer you know a hands-free cooking timer
just phenomenal because when when you're you know you got your hands deep in whatever and you just
don't want to touch anything like say you're going to use your phone as opposed to some sort of
you know egg timer type device uh that's a big deal and and like i said with the home assistant
so one of the things that i have um is my hp laser jet 5 and it's in my office so if my wife or
daughter want a print and that inkjet you know is you know near dead on whatever color and they just
want to print something black and white all they have to do is talk to google home and uh tell it
you know laser jet on or turn laser jet on and they can turn the printer on and off they don't
have to call to me turn it on did you turn it on yet that kind of thing they all they have
all they have to do is say i was thinking what is google home but i think we have a nice little
object like that however um the only thing with a used voice recognition so i guess somebody's
going to say it you know it would be it the google home i throw it would be it quantano in windows
it would be it um little saori or whatever apple's got you know all these things apparently um
can of course pick up on the voice data and transmiss it back to the companies and the spy on you
so i guess that's the one thing with these things especially when they have a file tell you
oh yeah yeah and you know so that's the short of it and i'll tell you what door door geek really
set this uh he's the one that shed light on on me for this point we're really walking around with
the device with two cameras and a microphone on it so if you're worried about crap uh you you're
already you're way deep into it so not having not having a google home or you know whatever
you know hockey puck device in your house that's recording you while the time
isn't going to make any safer because every other device that's connected to the internet has a
microphone on it but well yeah that's true as well all these Android phones and all all this stuff
all for you stupid laptop and yeah yeah the webcam we just said that i made the laptop all
that stuff can potentially spam you as well more so if it's running for priority toys off
where course which moves because he used to bless us like a Microsoft like my management management
but yeah well as they are in tell man in tell man in privacy respecting with the brim or
you hear about that one the brim laptops and the phone and um you can have a laptop that doesn't
do as much if you want you like the whole group of save richest downman or something like that
which may people don't because they want to do certain things that you know you have to have
use them close or softwetful well don't you think that's the trade-off is uh the fact that you may
be listening to you know if you're uh worried about it just shut the shut the things off when you
don't want to use them or you know sometimes i think some of us put a little bit too much emphasis on
big brother listening the emphasis is knowing big brother is listening and adapting your
than your ways of doing things to that in 25 years i haven't said anything that i don't expect
everybody to hear all the time especially email i have never typed an email message that i have
not fully expected a third party to read so you will never see an email from me saying
anything incriminating stupid or whatever now hey there there might be a number of audio
conversations or phone conversations sure yeah they're probably but um yeah likewise even in my home
there i will not say something so incredibly stupid uh that it would get me in trouble i've
offered said you know what i'm gonna hike 20 miles into the woods leaving my phone behind
in all electronics and anything electrical before i talk freely
well the same i heard Bruce Nair said at the conference i heard a couple years ago
ping-pong is we you know we could change you could have congress to 180 change the authorization
for this they to listen in on devices and all that and he says you know he he says you can't trust
just even if there's a law you can't trust it you if the if the technology is there for someone
to be monitoring you then you you have to proceed as if they were monitoring you agreed absolutely
that's that's well yeah i agree with that but both people don't think about they you know they do
is that do silly things around the phone and all the devices and all and you know and
and and think oh the camera's off or whatever but maybe on and uh i've been uh oh what's my last
event game or no the one that i went to obviously it's Linux still but you know got like a little
open-sus webcam cover giving to me understand the think it was and but yeah these devices will
spy and they've and they probably do spy and they might actually spy more than most people
actually realize or potentially and if they knew they might think oh well i better not use a
knife phone definitely not a knife phone because that's very close or so very proprietary but
many people don't know this so you know who's the richest company in the world Apple is
and quite a reason as well but you know generally excuse me if people knew about certain things
i'm sure Linux would have taken off a much more than it has on on the normal computers as well
and but it hasn't because people don't know and not just piracy but just generally speaking stability
performance um i mean there's various reasons why it hasn't gained the desktop market but it has
all the other markets than that pretty much than it's in some form with the other
as far as device toys they've picked up i can quite get to finish that but uh uh just here the other
day i think we probably saw a couple weeks go saw this uh new uh google cardboard camera thing that
was supposed to be able to that you put a pie in and uh you uh was able to distinguish between
dogs and cats which i guess maybe if you had a dog door or something i i didn't i didn't see
much i thought it was cool i i want to get one to play with but again i don't see a whole lot of
real world utility to what they've got built into it but probably the hard work they've got with it
somebody will find the way to do something cool with it and Lincoln Lincoln the same
hard to play more uh you know showed links to get both that and you know last year's uh google
voice kit that came out with the mag pie uh well last spring uh you know what you could actually
buy those now i've been waiting a long time to see where those were come up retail eventually they
would so uh so i looked and i came on micro center and i was thinking well uh okay
clear close ones in Kansas City maybe that would make it excuse for a road trip but i did
four i hope before just before clicking there i did i did a search online and you
you can get them on alibaba you can get you can get them on uh the voice kits i don't think you
can't get the camera kit anywhere now uh not even the micro center pops up a 404 but the voice
kits from last spring they're pretty uh pretty available you you can get them off but like
said alibaba you can get them off amazon you can get them off ebay so i bought a kit
from off uh amazon and actually assembled and i haven't messed up the software yet
it does have a dedicated image that they link to that you download but what it comes with is a kit
and essentially it has a hat that goes on the IO pins and the the hat is manager well it has
connectors for both microphone and speakers so it's a dedicated hat for audio i don't know if it's
just normal off the shelf uh raspberry pi audio hat or is it something they made just for this
and then you plug in the speakers you plug in the button
and you wire in the uh any any plug in the microphones and speakers rather than a dedicated plug
i was surprised you know they were just uh barriend like hysterio cable and you put it into a
jack and tighten a screw and tighten it down so it doesn't take too long to put together
comes with a copy of the magpie that would have come out originally with it and so this is just
photos you know i kind of squint squint at some of those photos you know bend what what way and do
what and slip this into here but eventually i figured it out so i've got a physically assembled
have not you know you you put the image on this decard and slip this decard in i can't
if the station do it and do you know do this and that and change other things uh nice thing about
the magpie it comes with it also comes with Python programming so you could actually hook up other
switch you know do other kinds of projects to physically turn on and off switches stuff like that
on on uh on top of this kit so it would it would not be just regulated to being a google home
and of course rich you know that on on your uh pod nuts show that uh mini pc show there's an image
out there or not an image but there there is an application that you can add to raspy and
that is both google echo i'm sorry amazon echo and and google home so i'll be right back
you know that that's probably you know i'll probably be the second second thing i try on this
since i don't have a version of an echo to play with so uh kind of going that i could you know
and again uh for what i paid for this i could not assemble the parts and i have assembled the parts to
uh to build my own uh home assistant and just not got them put not got around the thing together so i
could tell you this cardboard case version is you know at least assembly and affordability of the
parts a lot a lot easier and you know everything's but gonna work together so i put the uh i
wanted to get to that because i had put the link in the uh show notes so uh if anybody if anybody's
interested you can you can find amazon link there right okay so the google home i didn't really know
about that but i think the automation it's windows it's jams of echo i haven't really been paying
much attention to either although i wasn't um probably pc world careers in the uk j other week or
ever and yeah that yeah that happens in echo so and belas just the media player isn't it or something
like that which one's media player i don't know what's the amount of echo it's like a media player
with me actually it does well as the same stuff as the uh google home uh you know apparently we'll
try to you can order stuff uh from there in fact that's what a lot of people say it is and
is annoying about it is it's constantly saying hey are you sure you don't want to order this or
that off amazon uh let me see there's some neat stuff that they've been adding to both of them
i know like with my uh with my google home uh i can tell it to play stuff
off of both youtube and netflix so far as far as trying to get it to play the right thing or
whatever you know and it throws it up on my chromecast so i can say uh
hey google play the latest uh the uh video from so and so and put it on my office
all right here's a little play music video that's based on the latest backup billis
uh i just hope that's what wouldn't wouldn't hear me
that's why you got to say hey google shut up hey google shut up
thanks 50 hey google shut up
okay pull the cord out there that fix that
usually hard to read about shutting up when i tell it to shut up i've never tried that command
and uh another thing is uh you know you were talking about playing music
i you may maybe you're subscribed to the uh google music rich it okay any any time i ask
get to play stuff that says sorry you have to be a google home music uh music subscriber
i have to play that so i heard radio account but it does play some google music stuff for me also
which i'm kind of surprised at yeah i was waiting for that but it it doesn't do that
yeah i'm on play so little bit of it too hey it's still a little work with google music but it's a
smaller selection that makes sense because here's the thing you you could be knickled and dying to death
by all of these you know five or ten dollar a month accounts and unfortunately i don't have uh
Joel McLaughlin money to blow on that i got a question for you guys i'm suffering through this i
got uh like three sand disk 32 gig micro SD cards that are DOA wait and i have no idea when i
bought them or the receipts or anything like that they're guaranteed forever but i don't have any
of that prior documentation what the frick should i do ready to check yep yeah i guess we don't
have any ideas either dead air so if nobody's talking should i just spam my site you know hey go to
flyingrich.com sub my videos uh like my google plus post because everything's there at flyingrich.com
so i just do like a 24 hour commercial so uh flying right now you get the central Pennsylvania air
rate right but what's that aren't don't you have ties to central Pennsylvania area i grew up
on Long Island my dad lived in uh Hershey for a couple of years that's what man uh you're not
in the area area now let's say there's a cool uh show i was talking to mr jackson a little bit ago
and levied in in two weeks oh lebanon pennsylvania yeah i know the neighborhood what's going on
there it's a small small show called captain fever expo posted here in a second because you know at
the lebanon convention center they've got what i i think it's the biggest in the country
model airplane swap me and if you want to buy model airplane stuff for next to nothing that's
the place to go this is a small engine show kind of sort of i go for some of machinists so i
like it for tools and stuff but these guys as we make throwing cast the machine the little
the boars and the line board the damn things and make the make shafts and camshafts valves and
lifters and everything turn around spark plugs out of corn and and then they make these little
motors that actually run that's fricking wild that's wild mr jackson's of me as well as uh
broan produce years okay so the central pa uh let's see make sure make sure i got the date
right before i continue talking okay saturday march 10th 2018 if you're a model airplane i'm it's been
many years uh since i've been there so probably drones quad quad quad copters if humans can talk
that kind of thing uh at the lebanon convention center lebanon pa and their website is cpa.us
so that's the same location the exposed that i forgot what road that's on and let's see where's
the address here fall that haven't fever in the channel there and they've got the address it's 80
rocherty road ROCH or ty sound familiar that's it that's the same place yeah yeah that how much does
it cost to get in i and the line is let's see admission eight bucks which if if you're looking to
spend a hundred two hundred bucks on stuff that eight bucks is a well worth it next question is
is it worth you know for me it was a four hour drive to get out there and back but uh so eight hour
round trip but uh definitely if if you want to get some super deluxe amazing deals and unfortunately
all my model airplane stuff is more than 10 years old so all the new radios all that kind of stuff i
just don't have which which i'm dying i'm dying to get a quadcopter or tricopter or that kind of
thing about my gear 360 camera on it hey youtube had a cool thing i didn't understand what it was at
first i just saw it this morning for the first time so if you shoot a 360 video it there's a heat
map so you can watch your video and see where people who watched it were looking at you know the
most popular spots on your video which uh kind of at first it creeped me out but that i understood
what was what it was doing i'm like how do they know where people are looking i'm like oh oh 360
video they're panning around yeah previous years at the small inch they had a drag line that are
ever seen one of those drag line now what's that so drag lines this old open pit mining device uh
general you probably like three or four yards worth of uh worth of volume that's a big bucket that
that's to land on the ground you got another machine right i know what you're talking about yeah
they use cables to drop it down the dirt and then they use other cables to tilt it the
direction and pull it where they need it and then they pick it up and anyway it had a model
one with like a 12 foot boom and what was really interesting about it is somehow they got a hold
of the real uh a control unit from within the the cab and they hooked that up to the remote control
stuff for this thing so the real controls are control model drag line on big pilot dirt
really cool stuff oh it's really cool but a couple years back my cool introduced me to it years
ago arrested so um and i first saw the the first year i went was in like 2005 i believe it was
and uh there was a guy there that had taken all the cameras out a little
brings in some firewood for smokers like on your lawnmower and they replaced with his own little
valentine assemblies and solenoids and electronics he had an infinitely variable
essentially cam for his prison strat motors that's a way too much work there there was a guy in
long out the machinist i don't know if he worked for you know the big aircraft manufacturers
but he would make these engines that you you needed you know a fricking high power magnifying glass
to see you know like if he dropped a connecting rod you wouldn't find it
empty yeah there's guys with themons and uh pulse jets and you know all the stuff
all done in person seen a pulse jet run always wants to do that actually that's why i got into
model model uh aircraft is i want to fly a pulse jet in a gas turbine neither of which i've ever
done uh pulse jets are loud yes i've heard it each time it fires it's supposed to be like a shotgun
going off have you ever make a model v1 now i've none of that stuff just you know uh well
i always flew oddball airplanes i never flew anything too normal except for the train or i learned on
have you seen those pulse jets that you use for uh goco parts and stuff yeah yeah uh who's it
colon first i used to like his channel a whole lot before he went uh youtube red
and they've got those uh like j shape and all on uh pressure differentials within the
the confined space of the tube yeah i don't know how yeah the j type ones i i don't know the
mechanics on how those things work but yeah you see a lot of that in england it's pretty i if
i'm thinking correctly it's pretty similar to uh two-stroke uh motorcycle motors with big
exhaust i don't ever seen that right yeah it looks similar you're right it's about the same
principle you've got pressure in the back pressures with the the use for compression in the pulse jet
so colon first he i'm the i'm a little amazed at that guy i don't know a whole lot about him
personally uh but apparently he was a plumber and then he does all of these bad builds in some of
the stuff how he comes up with it i'm kind of shocked and and one of the things
was uh he built a pulse jet and the way he did it is he took uh did a pattern in sheet stainless
steel welded the edges and hooked a pressure washer to like he put a before he welded it together
he hooked a fitting in for the pressure washer and then got it its shape by pumping up the pressure
washer you know basically extruded it or however you want to say made it three-dimensional from two
dimensional and i was like wow that's pricking pretty fricking genius you know there's one of his
videos here i see how to form with the pressure washer pulse jet yeah i like watching i i'll tell
you the the one channel i i really like is uh bad obsession motor sports those guys the the
fabrication the metal fab they do is just amazing just absolutely amazing uh oh we had another time
zone go by who's in charge of announcing the time zones all right i cannot get uh let's see what
what did i try here it's uh an ubuntu mante on my pine book i could not i can't get it to boot
the image wrote and verified to the micro SD card but it's not booting it i don't know why
yeah sorry i was gonna step away and uh get one so i put myself on speaker i to plug the headphones
back in uh to both your issues rich uh the actors though i have two issues only
yeah uh i guess the last time zone that we tripped over is much of russia moscow to buy
adu abudabi and muscat if we if if we miss somebody we've we've had the same list for years
and probably should add to you know so uh and on uh and somebody was asking her earlier i think
i think was a bastion uh what i had on my pine book and i was looking back for something else
on uh podcast them all on the show notes uh linuxlookast.com so here i'm plugging my show
but uh and it it told me that the you know i talked i talked about installing the uh
uh ubuntu mante but on my pine book and it worked but rich the one i grabbed was to install
that to the emc so make sure there there are different images uh for the emc and for the for an
sd card so now make sure you gotta hold the right one well even if it runs off the sd card i'm
cool with that just uh to do a test drive well if you get if you get the one for the em
eemc you actually you do and still install that to an sd card and then when it boots up to the sd
card then it asks you to write them that if you want to write the image to the eemc as i recall
all right wait are you talking i have to remove the emc or i can boot it off the micro sd and then
write it to the emc yeah as you boot off the micro sd okay sorry and the images for the eemc
typically don't run from an s i mean it'll run to do to do the loader but it's not like
you can you can choose run it from the eemc or run it from the sd card the ones i mean they're
install or images only not running images so it looks like only a third of the world is
2018 and two-thirds of the world are 2017 well that would make sense because it hasn't hit
continental united states yet and we you know uh being in Kansas i would be darn near in the middle
i would think of obsolete equator or not dot equator the uh international date line
so it's very interesting the jagged line that the international date line is and how it
excludes some islands and includes others so there's islands that are further west of other islands
that are already 2018 that are not 2018 and will not be for a while so well i'm certain that
was all very political oh yeah absolutely so the island of midway is still 2017 but it is west of
let me pick one uh vacasafo yes exactly uh can you pronounce it so bigger island is another one
of those us minor outlying islands that is still 2017 but west of other islands that are already
2018 well i what i think was fascinating is there was a time in my krenees i believe no no in the
in the oh late middle ages or beginning of the enlightenment or whatever whatever came after
middle ages uh that the Protestant and the european and the catholic countries in europe were
off by about three months early well i know for them at several weeks at least well that's
interesting i i forget what island it is it's someplace in the pacific where we have like radar
listening uh towers but they skipped a day uh to conform with the international date line
and it was essentially the european said you know we're saying uh or i'm saying the Protestants
looked at it and said hey you know it it's pretty warm here in in December or something
something uh must be off because December is supposed to be winter looking back at the Romans
and then they figured out leap here essentially uh and and then it you know it thrown the calendar off
by uh i said i don't know if it's a month three months is a significant amount of time
and then it took like 60 years for the catholic countries to agree to make the same adjustment
and though that is not being critical of some you know any you know particular religion now
you know this is something that happened 500 years ago exactly you know and you you can see
it on correspondence from the period if if somebody's communicating you know from like france
to england they they will usually have both dates on there oh that's interesting man like i said
it's i don't want to tell you i didn't have i did not have any trouble getting you to
montage or to run uh and i am i'm still dual dual booting in in a fashion i just uh glued a
sd card adapter to the bottom of the case and i've got a i've got an sd with with uh android
on there uh so if i if i did want to boot in android i i could boot it in there and do the manipulation
to boot off the sd card instead got ya main reason i do that if i was traveling wanted to
wanted to run like a hulu app or netflix app and of course not watch it on the system because the
speakers again are horrible you know but you throw it up on your chromecast plug your hotel tv you know
well you you know you use a road war you'll probably do something very similar to that when you're
yeah i just enjoy a laptop and somebody saying the back i'm sure at home saying well why wouldn't
you use your phone for that not and uh not boot your laptop in a different oh s where you couldn't
use it for anything else and uh exactly that normally uh if there are things working with the phone
or whatever i would be using uh the phone as bd consumption device and the laptop is a work
device or at least check my email or whatever okay i'm trying to burn jesse minimal pinebook 719
so let's see next time someone's coming up we got Saudi Arabia uh is it still more of russia
what's that little island they were off uh africa it's a tansania madagascar
yeah um and i've got about four hours to go until that but uh i was just over here in 50 150 i think
basically saying that he uses phone no laptop for work phone for media consumption i was just
thinking that uh actually what i do now but although i don't need to use laptop most of the time
because of who i am but uh yeah that's basically it i i have my laptop i'll use it for you know
some virtualization for fun or whatever i'll do with these e-mails and stuff you don't actually
desktop don't see stuff on there and that kind of thing i'm not playing games and windows
i rarely need windows or anything that's a good thing i think but i'm getting by just i can get
you know these smartphone you can do quite a lot with them if you're anything quite basic things
e-mail listening to music um youtube video it was all kind of stuff and that i think is a majority
people these days as well that they generally will use their phones or tablets for nightfall you
know 70% of what they're doing almost stuff they're doing on occasion they'll be on on a laptop
not just me but everybody um and i do feel that with a laptop you either have to use it because
you know you do work on it or something and you kind of have to use it or that you don't really
needs a laptop for the most part because you can do these phone and the tablets and some of these
tablets are basically laptops for most parts anyway they've got keyboard then you've got these
devices such as dp pocket even which i mentioned earlier and so a standard laptop is i mean
dp pocket is just a mini laptop so an inch laptop for the most part and so a standard laptop i
think is uh not out yet but i need a desktop pc that's the bait the whole desktop pc have
disappeared and they're not particularly using them all but that in business the obviously aren't
and for gaming they are but otherwise yeah i suppose best tops are not as popular as they used to be
definitely and you know in my in my case most of my travel if not all is recreational and that would
include conferences you know so it's not like i take my laptop because i have a project due on
Tuesday or something and i have to be working on it through the weekend while at the conference
and i know a lot of people they don't they don't have that luxury and and really as far as
media consumption you know if i'm paying to get on a plane fly to a conference you know see the
you know go to the conference and then i'm i'm spending my evenings in the hotel room watching
Netflix i'm doing something wrong so so would be in theory i bring a chrome cast with me i never
really used it except just plug it in and see that it would work uh but yeah i can i can see
if some i said robo warriors like rich you you know get a job and then they're in a hotel for a week
or two weeks or whatever definitely that would be uh you know something and yeah we're reading
emails is one thing uh doing quick responses is one thing if some you know if if if somebody
asks me something on an email that takes me half a page to uh to explain i would you know and uh
you know pulling in links from the internet or whatever i'd much rather do that on a laptop and
since i have plenty of laptops and one of them being uh 79 dollar featherweight laptop i you know
it's not not even uh not even have to think about it just to throw that in the uh in the
carry on yeah if it was if my only laptop was uh you know eleven hundred dollar laptop and i
was doing all my work at home through it too and that was my only computer yeah probably i would
leave that at home uh when traveling i i i i agree with that i mean well i guess i mean
thing is yeah it's just which is another point let's talk travels a good point so okay
i'll talk about myself actually as an example because i do have bristles coming up in again in just uh
well you know it's about to be January i'm going to go a bit longer as well because i'm going to
go to some uh public speaking groups in bristles as well so do it over here we'll try it out
some in a different city i'll go for fuzz then the big uh you know three open sorcerer because you
were here in the meeting the big great you were appearing event for that and for this kind of stuff
and of course my laptop is definitely staying here i don't want a 14 inch laptop with me it's
bad enough uh when you fill up your travel bag with your your various t-shirts from the events and
other things uh and a personal bag is small anyway so i will not you know that's not coming no
that's definitely not coming i'll take um my dpd pocket probably because that is a very nice
portable device i mean i could take the dpxd it would mean they get the same reason it's
nice portable dpd uh win which uh if i you know if i type those last time with two dp other dp devices
with me you know very small little mini pc's basically uh in the case with dp pocket if it was
internet connected if i had actual what do you say work to do you know emails and all this
stuff that you were just talking about then yes did the built in keyboard built on keyboard is a
little bit it's it you can type on it but it's not amazing however it does have usb ports a normal
usb port so you can put in your own mini keyboard like i've done with my other dp devices before
uh so i would say that that could be used as and instead of a laptop for the most part
uh be that for for what mine traveling be that for uh business or be it for you know recreational
fun use or as the word used um and i think you know i and that's basically it no one wants to
build key devices with them anyway i i don't i don't want i don't want big bulk key devices with me
all the small things if i'm going to travel um so yeah phones can be okay as well tablet
depending what you got but i think the the standard laptop i think uh that that's actually unnecessary
to bring around uh when traveling when if if you've got devices such as the dp pocket then i think
bringing a standard laptop along for traveling is probably unnecessary to be honest these days
well i would like to see if somebody would do a project using the uh the the the pine book and
building you know one one of these things like the size of a gpd pocket that would fit in you know
save pocket of a pair of cargo kits which they could easily do if you if you take the bottom of it off
put to do anything like i had to do to to uh the uh bigger ee emc that i bought it was included
but not installed uh and if you look in there there there's like two boards and like that they
must be electronically compatible with a pine 64 but they're definitely not the pine 64 board and
you know all all of your uh ports you know your ethernet port and all that stuff is all
you know it is a remote connection so you know so there's wires going across there but essentially
you have something like a very thin you know form factor of Raspberry Pi except not you know
very thin because it doesn't have uh ethernet or usb ports connected to it and you got a couple
of those stacked one on top of the other and that's it you've got a battery you've got speakers
and you've got the keyboard and that's why when this thing goes through uh security
to airport they're looking at it and here's you know here's this empty box going through
yeah uh which makes which makes them nervous you know what is that really so you know i'm the you
oh well yeah so i mean yeah yeah and then we used to talk about this earlier and i remember
somebody at my Linux user group or i believe it was i went along with my you know some of my
devices like i did it when and i showed them the dp pocket briefly and they were like oh you know
if you're going to travel with your device like that they're going to um possibly get a bit
silly on the security because it doesn't come up in the weird shape on the scanner and things
like this and then and i think that's basically what you're talking about and apparently some people
have actually traveled in their ports with these kind of devices and then been stopped that security
because of you know well it might have been and so i'm a bit like uh i mean last time when i went
to Brussels actually this this year well okay some of the worlds in 2018 already i'm in 2017 and
just under four hours now personally but i did go to Brussels this year uh back in february and
i did like i mentioned just now i did bring my dp pocket with me and i did bring my uh no sorry
not dp pocket dp xd me pc and the dpd win and um i had to fly to an airport where something had
happened that year so uh basically so um the security was was up and uh i like they do
they say to you bring out take out your phones take out your tablets take out your mini take out
what you know you'll detect the rightes and i was a bit um i mean it when i went to Sweden again
the previous year i believe it was or probably previous year in the summer i remember going
through stance to their port in london or this one we get would be in through all those many times
being half Swedish as well but anyway and i remember that the woman there saying like uh what's
that is it is it like talk as many of you as i took it as like i was like should i take this out
and it was a bit like no actually no no that was on the Swedish end because i went through stance
there but left in my bag no problem and then the Sweden date they said like um what i'd like
should i take this device out and she'd like is it laptop as a tablet i know really
um but that was all fine but uh in brussels i i i went through with it uh this year on on the way back
and i felt like you know i this yeah yeah i probably take it out really and so i did and yeah
went for a scan they're fine no problem you know it's just a mini PC but but i did hear us but yeah
i did hear the bait that actually uh quite a few of these devices you may not act well do you
don't necessarily need them out like that but they get you to do it anyway or it's more so the bigger
like there's like big laptops those should be out definitely the smaller devices possibly not i
think i heard somewhere um but yeah it's very annoying having to take take out in the airport for
obvious reasons especially when the baggage uh disappears for a long good while like in stance
there that port there's big airports and you just waiting on the other end for the scanner
for the people scanner you know waiting waiting for your baggage come and you think where is it
and then there's all these people around and you know you can potentially lose stuff easier there
but um yeah yeah you've traveled some with my uh what was still working my remix ultra
tablet and since it has you know it has a detachable keyboard which you just
literally even on there all the time and so uh even though it's actually they say no we don't
need to see tablets i always drug it out because they're going to look in there and see what
is then a laptop and you know so rather not rather than argue with them about it just
just easier to pull it out where they can see it uh you said when your remix ultra tablet was still
working because i'm wondering now what happened there but mine is still working although uh the
i think some of the case singles something on the back came off slightly because i took it
i took it to um canterbury with me back in august for camp and some guys were like to me
oh you do the back is sort of but not so oh look it's probably okay enough but there's people
I knew but um but yeah i suppose it still works but maybe it's best not to to travel around with
too much because um you might ask you it's okay enough but it's one of these devices that
are probably hard to fit get fixed actually if something does happen because it's so rare for a
star aren't they and uh but i guess none of the battery is okay and all that stuff
then it's mostly okay but uh what happens your what happens your ultra remix tablet then
oh about six months after i got it and uh it happened about the first time i traveled with it i mean
one of the reasons that sold me on uh you know the remix tablet uh over anything else
was the gps so you know rather than looking at gp uh google maps on my phone uh 13 inch display
traveling and uh well first time i took it was to belling him for linux fest north west
and and i'm telling him it's one of those places you just can't get there from here at least not
by playing at least not practically so the best you can do is fly into Seattle and then drive the
last uh two hours uh with rental cars so i thought it would help me for that and you know
wouldn't connect to gps the whole time i was out there connected fine when i got back home
why did i guess i did take it out for test drive one time two or three blocks and it worked and
then again for the drive home it didn't want to work and also the wifi quit working i thought that
was maybe the hotel got home i kept getting this thing where you know it worked fine for weeks then
suddenly the wifi would quit working and not that it wouldn't connect it it would just look like
there was no wifi hardware in there you would go to it and the whole thing would be grayed out uh like
maybe there was a physical disconnect and if you left it you know when it got word it had to be
you know first it was a couple days uh you know then it got to be like maybe a couple weeks
that if you just left it and then would you know boot it back up you get wifi back
and i didn't send it in because it was doing great for me everything i wanted when it
when it worked and when it worked i hated you know i hated to lose it and then finally got to the
point where you know remix remix wasn't selling them or or repairing them either you know there wasn't
there wasn't any there wasn't anybody send it back to to get it fixed uh yeah well i suppose
but uh remix OS my my ultra-tabler uh well yeah it worked fine i mean i didn't update the
remix OS version for quite a long time i haven't i have now but you know it still works it but yes
it's that and with your GPS and all this you would hope it works so it's just basically Chinese
Android hardware i'm really but running a slightly customized version of Manvoid
i do think it's the shame that remix OS got dropped but then again google apparently has something
similar now i can't remember what it was i read something uh and but yeah it's chain because it's
nice hot it's a nice device uh from most part you know and and if it's really if that's really yet
that's the only other stuff around them and there's nothing else then then obviously there's
not gonna be a security updates and stuff i suppose and you know that it becomes less secure online
ask for uh if it still works don't fix it or in this kit or more like if it still works or enough
so don't send it off to get fixed or repaired um i've i've had that i've been caught out with that
issue myself uh with a HP laptop because because uh i you know from day one it would overheat your
times in fact the windows there was only windows on there it would come up saying that there was an
error there was overheating at times look i put it in that song obviously limits is is more forgiving
or safe to have a fault although if i'd read that better log files maybe there would have been
stuff in now you know hidden away it's not you know it's not set like windows where it blues greens
or whatever but um as i mentioned earlier on here um i'm getting that one i've got that one fixed
uh i just send that back i just send off to best to serve to get it fixed because i
i like a little shopper pair and they mean look at it how the guy look at it that i knew as well
my limits use group um so and they want that they can do that much so i got it sent off to the
HP uh partner company or any best use there what for that is and uh i rang up and of course it's
now you've got to pay for this and the guy from my limits use group so if you play if you tell them
that there's consumer rights laws there's that it should have been working all along
i just spent five fifty for it it should be worked for at least three four up to five years then
maybe you would have got a free fix but then of course you have to go and find your old chat logs
that mail may not exist still from old emails but hours of emails and email count you know that
would have been hassle yeah about time i gave up on uh oh uh oh uh oh um
but your song's like i just want to finish it off quickly because i'm at my fame got uh
yeah so so so i i i had um so i got it sent back off and of course on the phone about now
no you got to pay it's that warranty and like you said it would be you know and so i got
so it's like that's gonna be three hundred pounds to fix and then she's like oh we can get down by
uh more let me just check where my manager and it goes down to two hundred and thirteen pounds which
if you know you came money is still uh not the most cheapest thing to be spending on a laptop
date it's not two it's not too bad but it's you know it's fair bit of money and and uh i
happened to have some money for that the time so you know and so it's like uh i got it fixed
it came back to the motherboard and i have an issue putting a bundle on it more recently after all
the windows that i've been going through um but i do keep it's a plastic carrier case that they
pull it in to send off in and send it back in Casper Michael because that's like a blowup um like
i suppose it's gonna be a temporary laptop carrying thing really but it but it's quite nice how
it's sort of done and stuff so i'm still keeping that at least for now but it's annoying when you
got a fix and and then yeah i didn't want to send it off because i'm using it and then you got
your data on it go get your hardest out and all this uh go get it taken out before i sent it off but
got a new hardest put in it but but yeah it should have been working all along from the beginning
more more so properly and you you'd you'd think or hope that with something like HP that actually
they're they're good brand or so you hope or think uh and that there should be some sort of
quality or something but not with this lab not not so with this laptop and uh but yeah it's just
brand isn't it at the end of the day names brands it's all similar really you have where in most
laptops that's better than i say well the trouble of HP or Dell or Lenovo they you know they've
got to compete with that with those bottom-end ones too you know people people don't know the
difference look on there and they you know see an o-name brand and uh they can you know
get a laptop for three hundred dollars and they go that way so you know HP and Dell and the good
ones they they you know they they have a range you know they they have they'll cheap oh ones too
so they can compete and then for the people recognize a little bit of quality they have some more
expensive i think i think this one was poly mid range or rather five hundred and fifty pounds
you know it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's not in the middle but i did i did also
wait for this laptop specifically because when i was looking around two years ago for a new laptop
because my Aces EPC X-101 the H the those last Aces EPC they made or one of the last ones
is a 2011 model it i got it in 2012 but um it's you know it's a nice it's it was nice to have
to bugle some of the few issues with the with that as well using my instant on chip OS when we've
opened up and that's something else anyway oh and there's some sort of power actually many that's
something else but yeah these are not a laptop really so i thought hmm a touch screen would
actually be quite nice i think because of all these phones and tablets now and and it'd be nice
to have a touch screen especially with something like loom shell i mean when i first got to try
gloom shell for real gloom free you know back a few years back because there were problems with
mobile computers getting it to actually work but it's a trick to get your fingerprints
but then a few years ago i tried out and fuzzed them on the open system that she had a touch screen
and that that was nice and and i had about certain people with touch screen laptops and you know
i thought it'd be very nice for me to have a touch screen so i looked around and
they were very popped up and they had a virus issue apparently at the time where a lot of people
window laptops has actually been had viruses pre-installed by their other company puts the
pre-installed software and all whatever but this HP laptop up it was a bit bendable not not
360 but it could bend into sort of tablet shape with a key room top and i waited for that laptop
and and i used an iPad Air in the meantime that i'd got cheap one way back from Brussels
um for a few months i was waiting and that was okay but but you see but then the uofi i was worried
about the uofi stuff as well for obvious reasons and luckily once i figured out how to do uofi
on this laptop it was wasn't too bad to discuss the in can you turn off text-to-speech in
mumble settings dank shun i and the bot is telling saying that it's new with text-to-speech
shun but i don't think it is uh kasper it is no quisha yes it is and that's so far as your bot 51 50
well the text-to-speech is funny because uh it's definitely coming over in a brit voice as
opposed to an american english i just put a uh test message in the mumble chat nothing came up so
and so did i
i did a text text-to-speech was still checked okay so i unchecked it
wait who was it was it me or you because i tell you maybe i don't think it's me but
but maybe it's kasper now it's gone
but who was it? kasper from kasper
but yeah well i had it so i thought it was 51 50 all along but if it's me then
there's plumballs. kasper it's you
yes i'm the only one unsaid it yeah there is a setting in plumball that you can shut it off
what do you think it is me for real?
video on your pine book what you idea of i'm loading xfc right now?
uh marté uh so should i've loaded marté instead?
well i thought you said you did try you move to marté
no i ended up getting a jesse something i couldn't get that to boot
okay i've said it it's been six months or something you know they've done an update they could
have changed something i haven't had mine up and running and you know while i found out at least
the uh you know if you leave if you leave it set not plugged in the battery seems to run down on
me yep so she you know if you want to use it to be usable you'd have to have it
like i've got i've got it in well i've got two laptops because of that in my uh uh
it go bag uh that in a regular laptop because you know unless i had to
had it plugged in sitting in the bag it's not going to be that much used to me
oh that's funny you're right you referred to it as an it go bag
i guess or consult back or whatever also actually i did from probably in poultry because
really what i'm using is a big laptop bag right now uh did did see uh or did bring home from the
farm store a little bit bigger plastic uh uh you know a toolbox thing with a handle and wheels
so like roll like uh luggage so thinking maybe that would be more to impress the customers
you know to roll and your stuff in see that that's why you'd want to go to the range now i really
need a hand truck oh and it was mentioned uh at the 30-minute mark we missed because we were having
a conversation we we missed the latest uh greetings so to Iran Tehran Rasheet Estfun and uh
Bander Abbas uh welcome to the new year yeah welcome to you but where's the settings if it is
me oh i can't see the frame than he's sitting around but although although i don't hear anything at
the moment of course but um just take to speak to me this uh i'm always surprised that we never
pick up any uh service members as we come past those those areas of the world however you know
i'm i'm sure they've been waiting for party all year and have better things to do
they may have better things to do but if you're serving you might not be allowed to participate
in open source things ventures of any type i don't know i surely i wouldn't think it would be that
locked down unless it's just a general thing you know don't uh don't get on anything or you could
be quoted by media or something like that i mean uh as much open sources used by the military now
i can't imagine so there's some edict says no you you can't you can't be out there supporting that
hippie open source stuff you can't uh oh um second if it was me then yes it looks like it may have
actually been because there was a ticking the settings there um although brick voice i don't know
if that messes or not because like you're saying it's but yeah this is in that's a good
unless you have the text whatever but that should be gone hopefully now but i really thought
was fifty one fifty for some reason well probably was me too i had uh this is a this i hadn't
gotten through the configuration of mumble on this like i had on some way older stuff so there was
press the talk was still ticked but i had it all i had i had it all with the volume all the way
down so i figured that would mute it but i thought it's or not press the talk text to speech
and yeah it's it's on the main configuration menu right there i was looking down farther and
menus is why i didn't catch it so it should be gone now yeah yeah and also i think i need some
fireworks outside to set this up so these people are three hours and a bit early but yeah some people
just can't wake and they maybe that's what it is and think what i'm saying guys i'm going to be
listening but i really need to go warm up my lunch so i'm going to do that and be back
no fitty don't go oh it's 70 degrees outside right now it will be cold right out here at seven
degrees c i bleed by the salio uh raining and i'm actually going to go out outside very briefly
very soon in in this uh weather which i know is not the nicest and uh if anybody gets lonely
because there's not enough chat i bet Casper's in here i'm sure um he can uh get one there's a
guitar again well actually he's to do that anyway because it was it was kind of interesting
my hand anyway
ten four also actually actually i was thinking when i said earlier could you hear my washing
machines the mine machine uh and you said range against machine and then you start playing something
and i thought that's not very much games machine isn't so in that case can you play something
similar to the actual range against machine no i uh that would require uh additional resources
and i got good news if anyone has listened to the alien brothers podcast with Casper and Reddiger
Ruddiger will be joining us on the new year's live show he'll be able to broadcast live from above
the van Allen belt transmitting through it's going to be a bar when's that going to be uh
standby crap i'm doing an apt install of xfce since it takes a fricking long time
not as long as windows updates i've just been dealing with that one
i bet yeah especially when you do windows 8.1 back to windows 10 because you know that ends up
being another two hours or so at the reboots uh somehow bill gates gets a dollar every time you reboot
i don't know how it works but otherwise why would he make it reboot so often well
it's always nothing in work for Microsoft anymore i think actually being more serious the reason
it needs all these reboots and i'm sure a lot of people listening to this would would agree with me
probably is that basically you know technically it is designed not very well as full so yeah you need
reboots after this reboots after that and yeah right i'm gonna i'm gonna uh i'll be away for a bit
i'll be back in a bit all right yeah i think i was gonna go to the kitchen and hunt down some food
we got dead air it's good time good time to check in to greet our our friends terrestrial
and or otherwise you're on hacker public radio so always as we'd like to thank josh and honest
on from an honest host who is nice enough to let us uh let us journey on his uh on his server
and he's a good host we talked earlier earlier in a day i'll be back in a bit cast bus so if you
put your friend coming on uh well yeah we listen to it uh yeah uh reddiger is uh i asked for an
ETA have not received it yet so because we've got some dead air and uh got some time if there's
some dead air and you're new and i think you know what to do oh thank you bloody well no exactly what
we're gonna do put your blood to stoyle slash y'all's out with some rise of blights
yes alien brothers podcast with caster and reddiger that's what we do
we just started very relatively recently on the inner webs so uh you you are for absolutely
forgiven uh uh yes and i will give you a link to uh some good stuff here uh all right
have a good public if only one could type
and this is a reminder to everyone out there please type slowly you do not want to
do type the wrong thing if you type the wrong thing as we were discussing earlier we were very happy
to hear that our commander in chief has a big red button and it brings him a coke and we're very glad
that our commander in chief has a red button that brings him a coke rather than another red button
that does something else without further ado let me give you a link first to
probably the introductory podcast um here is our second one not our best one
type slowly yeah all right let's see what we can get here
search find any other aliens there we go there's the introduction one this was a much better one
as i was describing earlier to clat 2 and to the others to Ken who is not the moderator he is not
the leader so he says oh okay ring in the bells ding ding dong good good that's what that's what
we like to hear pack a public radio bring it to your life all right okay let's let's do some good
let's do some good stuff self-hosted well that's you know Casper and Rudder the alien brothers we are
going to have to consider opening up a hosted site of our own on an honest host because of our talk
or our transmissions with josh we believe that on your blue marble terrestrial plane that an honest
host is the best host perhaps the host with the most so let's see what we can do here um thoughts
and here we go all right
you don't eat your own feedback all right here we go that's what i was looking for
alien brothers will come through oh yes we were discussing bin rev earlier
uh when the podcast kicked off it was mean ken and pirate uh was here at the start and then clat 2
joined shortly afterwards as uh his terrestrial time zone had been reached they launched uh they
launched things from the tip of the uh whatever it's called and wherever he was um i hope somebody
can continue to take notes be very gracious of them and if Casper can bring us forward we're
going to be crossing on over to 20 more Baghdad across in the middle east coming up in about six
minutes here on hack a public radio middle east aliens here that that is a troubled troubled part
of the world and uh in that along those lines we would would like to transmit a song for parts
known and unknown um i'm going to mute myself for a quick make sure that the tunes are tuned
uh standby all right ready to go oh yeah oh yeah all right let's do it without further do
five minutes to Baghdad could be bombs drop in there are bombs drop them all the time
here's to the state of the middle east

for underneath your boys there's soil and it's there and halibut wants to build some
uh hi blinds over there and beneath your your mountains where you'd like to live
whoa how the burden would like to give you a pipeline and hide a thousand different crimes
the calendar is lying when it reads the present time oh here's to land that we've torn out the
part of Baghdad find yourself another country to be part of
and here's to the middle east we drop bombs not the least
say folks over there they just don't understand and they tremble in their shadows at the
thunder of the clan the sweating of their souls can't wash the blood off their hands they smile
and shrug the shoulders as the murder of a man a man oh oh here's to the middle east that way off
tearing out the heart of
the
the Baghdad please find yourself another planet to be part of
and here's to the schools of Baghdad
when they're leashing all the children they don't have to care and all the
rudiments of hatred and presence everywhere and every a single classroom is a factory of despair
and there's nobody
learning such a foreign word as fair
whoa here's to the lands that we've torn out the heart of
Baghdad find yourself another country or planet to be part of
and here's to the judges on secret courts of known and unknown region
of spare parts unknown on your blue marble down there
who wear the rope of honor as they crawl in the courts they're guarding all the bastions of
their phony legal fort oh justice is a stranger when the prisoners report when the black man stands
accused trial is always short oh here's to the land we've torn out the heart of
the Baghdad find yourself another planet to be part of
and here's to the governments of Baghdad
in their swamp of bureaucracy there's always a bogging down and criminals are posing
as the mayors of the towns and they hope that no one sees the sights as no one hears the sounds
and the speeches of the governor are ravings of a clown
and here's to the land
that we have bombed the hell out of
Mississippi find yourself
or Baghdad another planet to be part of and the alien brothers will welcome you
to our galaxy when you're ready we know you're ready is anybody still out there
yeah Casper key nap here i'm still sitting around good stuff and it was really good
uh i just just having having a boot all right okay all right yeah
everybody needs a break they got to do some stuff they got to do some things some dives and
knolls and but no spans no dives as Ken is is eager to say
hey
Casper just wants to wish everybody on the hacker public radio a very happy new year to all
that's what he saw the ranting was on the wall and we won't fall we won't fall we won't fall
oh
Casper just wants to wish everybody on the hacker public radio some good
a happy new year hopefully better than the last year if it was not a good year
did we see the blimp i'm not sure hopefully today is a good day as some ice men would say
that's why we're here we want our transmissions to be clear
to hacker public radio and josh an honest host with the most will
service all service all services services are provided for an honest price
no fine print all up front that's the best that i can say because honesty is the best policy
unless you got a secret but if you got a secret they say you don't if you don't have
anything to hide you should just keep going live and broadcast into your smart bugs
mean the smartphones you got to pull that insect out of your head
pull the insect out of your head
that's the first step you know had to go through
when we brought him out of the matrix
out of the matrix sub spare some would say out of the frying pan and into the fire
but that's how hobbits do it and the key we stayed a few zealings
the cross and over boardries and simulis
but that's okay
all you need is someone to say it will be a good day for everybody on the hpr podcast
it's gonna last as long as it does call you my cause because you're here and i'm so happy that we
were able to manifest our physical alien presence
the center of the earth coming back through an article passing by a new shrub in land
and then coming back out maybe two Ireland or Iceland
or i don't know lands parts unknown and parts known to all
if anybody wants to stop cast boat please
charm on it
his fingers can only
the west of the west of the
21 tz thank you kwisher but keeping the soundtrack welcome to gordon for joining i think i'll
give my fingers a rest and hope for the best for the hacker public radio podcast live new your
cf6 annual evening all evening all evening i think i need a better shortcut than this my one
they'll just keep coming up in my second no is my
and i'm getting pace from the other room
is it anybody else have instruments that they'd like to play digital analog by and a translog
there's so web what's this a web yeah sorry that is that is formally that that's me yes
of just yeah that is me how are you guys doing it's been a while
oh it's definitely good to hear you
it's good to hear everybody it's the community it's community to podcast
i'll need to change my bottom again i'm all the different good now
all right we got dead airberries pick a topic any topic we'll do
or or i can just keep going on
all right i've got a topic for you um it was common but everybody seemed to think it was
common knowledge that i thought slowed down though but i always um are the various things as
common to get people to upgrade this time round they've done it and they're getting lost it
some things like that is there's something different this time to what the normal
do what they're gonna open secret has been there's something different this time
i can certainly speak to that uh yes so the yeah we anybody who's familiar with Apple
products knows that anytime a new oh west would come out their phones would get slower the google
searches go up why is my phone so slow and that goes back we talked a little bit about this
back at the beginning of podcast uh and it's planned obsolescence it's uh apple being apple
why are they using this glue that we cannot unglu to put their products together uh i mean
the chinese kids you should probably shouldn't be in inhaling those those stuff you know uh
so that that's a whole different thing um and if fox con's gonna open up a factory
the factory in the states as as was once said they're gonna have to to make some bigger nets because
i don't i don't think they're familiar with the air the american body type they're gonna need to
adjust the the nets to catch the uh the factory workers go and dark all right uh uh so
yes everybody kind of knew that already yeah however apple did not
was never forthcoming with this as is apples waste and uh the big news was that after numerous
people had done their own studies of the cpu readings and their frequencies uh over time with
different batteries etc etc they they confirmed yes your cpu is being throttled so uh the cpu
is being throttled and so apple finally had to cop to that and their their weak weak excuse
for throttling the cpu or this is arguable uh but the excuse they gave was that
that they had some sort of bug in their batteries or something that some batteries if they got to 40
percent and they tried to use the full power of the cpu then they would shut down completely so
they were like uh well you'd rather your phone work at 40 percent rather than shut down right
well yeah but i'd also like to maybe have the option uh and maybe i'd like to know about that
that you know if you buy a piece of hardware and it says it's it runs at you know four gigatron
watts and and you're you're trying to run it for gigatron watts and you're like hey why is my
my new shiny me device not operating at four gigatron watts oh it's the battery okay well what's
up at that can i replace it nope can't can replace it well you can and they'll give that to you
for a thirty dollars now so enjoy that yeah now i'm talking about this time it seems to it seems
to be an open thing that that's a common thing that the different companies do so why this time
i mean this is now on to iOS 11 why is it taken until now why why 2017 have the finally
been caught out with that because surely if they've been doing things like that before then
this wouldn't be the first time that we'd be hearing about it yeah i think uh that's a two-part
question mate it's possible that this is the first time that potentially members of the hacker
public radio community have have taken the deep dives into the cpu readings um but they've also
ramped it up in i believe it was ten dot two of ios and eleven and there were bits of code i think
they were able to pull uh and so they they were able to say oh no this is definitely definitely
something um an issue and so that's what forced apple to cop to it and so there's class action
lawsuits there's a lot of stuff going on in the states as the aliens understand
as thought up didn't apple change all their ios over to 64 by only this year as well
so i wonder if that's possibly been a contribution to this like the third to rewrite a lot of stuff
and any of the old um 32-bit stuff if there's libraries there might need to run a slow speed
or not use the full the full os or whatever it is um i wonder if that's part of it
it's quite possible these are all possibilities we act uh the alien brothers here will try to
try to do some some research on the interwebs get the uh get the good good juice
good juice okay underscore sixteen happy new year we got blue from from soap phone phone
um thank you so far sorry that was meant to be muted i didn't realize that wasn't muted
you're doing a duel a duel cast um my daughter wants my um attention in the other room so i
figured i'll take my phone in there but um it's going to sound horrible so i logged in on my
computer to actually have a decent uh microphone no worries no worries no judge no judgment
here do your microphones are overrated
microphones microphones yeah um mic microphones yes yeah those things you're speaking into
the things that are that's cunningly disguised as owls i guess ratings are overrated lately
yes we're we're earlier we're discussing the fall and potentially potential infiltration of
rotten tomatoes giving huge uh huge uh ratings to the latest planet of the apes which some people
thought was they said whoa whoa whoa whoa we're wondering if there's too many ratings or not uh
not uh set up by anybody but the whoever's trying to sell the product
yeah and on that note we also we're talking about IMDB no offer allows for comments to be posted on
any movies aliens can only wonder why that would be i did read somewhere about the um one of the
news feeds about the alt-right taking care of it for um the the backlash against the last Jedi on
rotten tomatoes so what what the alt-right is is doing something with uh potatoes or tomatoes no
that's the um when the last Jedi got a lot of backlash well it was getting a lot of backlash um
sort of mixed stuff on rotten tomatoes and bringing the um bringing the scores right down
apparently there was a news article that said that the alt-right were claiming credit for that
i don't know how possibly it's a campaign to go in and vote things down and comment things down
i don't know um so push the talk as if you go into the settings in mumble uh in configure and audio
but you can either go into the settings and change one of the shortcuts uh to a button that you
don't use and that way you press the button hold the button down when you're talking as as i am
and then you where it goes as thus push the talks actually really handy especially
that a lot of people in the same channel um or not and well i'm gonna go and get a beer
there'll be a bit of a second am i pushing that talk no no i'm not no uh num lock maybe num num lock
num lock no all right no hold on got it get out of the text get out of the box let's try it again
hey Casper Kevin Wischer just posted a um a link to the PDF that will tell you how to do it pretty easily
thank you thank you all right yeah i configured aid okay let's try this again here
you've probably got the there we go now i'm using push the talk yeah push the talks actually
really handy um i find out quite early on when i discovered mumble a long time ago
i'm i'm a night i i think i have to not use the keypad there's something wrong with that
standby Casper is going to adjust his galactical keyboard
so happy new year is everybody i'm happy new year to you too
i think new year long time no see bokeh oh yeah i
my new job keeps me hop and it's not like i could just you know like my old job where i could just
pop on i rc for most of the day this one uh this one keeps me running most of the time
so as i say and check i guess i need to tell my don't can anyone hear the music that's on behind me
i'll probably be in well i've been talking i don't hear anything now nope i'm out there uh i
hope that nobody can hear my radio in the background put some strange sounds
i'm going to meet myself and read you my configuration wizard and use push the talk
because i did not set that up immediately with the push the talk too if you're uh older or like
from the hill country like i am the push the talk is similar to the ham or the cb radio and it's
pre-convenient i agree yeah absolutely more than anything else it reduces uh feedback
you know people people feeding back um stuff the data that they're listening to reduces that
but it also helps if people are editing because it makes um dead spaces that are very easy to
truncate but also makes it easier to try and work out when when you've got a chance to speak
because if someone's lips are keeping flashing on and on and on because they're that's being triggered
their mic is being triggered by something in the background you don't know when you can speak
yeah that's true the little lip icon that turns red when someone's keyed up
you know the funny thing is uh on amateur radio i don't use push the talk i use my box
it's funny that i have to use push the talk here because the box just doesn't uh doesn't suit uh
suit what we're doing now i've tried using box before and a couple other people have tried
really hard to use it and it just doesn't pick up quick enough is the problem with with
vox through mumble and if you use something external to use vox like you probably a pretty good mic
that works for you with your ham radio you'd have to leave mumble in constant transmit mode so
that's not gonna work either kind of defeats the purpose it works pretty well here but i'm
i have an external noise gate which uh makes doing the software side of it through mumble a lot
easier oh yeah actually you're you're right that what i wasn't wasn't considering hardware noise
gates what's your special shut up bill go go back to whatever you're doing before
special pick it on you on irc that's what i'm doing okay push the talk is enabled all right
thank you everybody it's gonna make uh doing the guitar bit a bit harder though
what's thinking about that yeah yeah it's gonna make it a little bit harder
should we tell them about double click yeah if you just double click your push the talk
it'll stay open the michael stay open until you uh click it again to shut it off
ten four uh ten four no four four it's more like it what's the four one one
um nobody i got nothing sorry i give up you know what happens when that happens right
anybody know what error four one one is i don't think there is one isn't it just the information
dial number i don't i don't know i ever once in a while i'll hear i'll see something other than
four on a web page yeah you get like a five hundred server error you go three oh two redirect
or something like that there might be four one one four one one is required you know length
required uh every four one eight that's great dammit i was going i was going for the whole thing
right now what's half a nine one one corner cops kid or something like that instead of a nine
one one one four one one or a pretend cop i don't know i'm a two you put i'm a two put yeah
short short short short April full day
act test test can anybody hear me then clear don't say anything
well i think i think like this year i've seen the funniest but the funniest bit of the
would you call it uh cartoon animation you seen you seen i know i know
again hello hello is anybody up there yeah that's those phones not on uh there we go
now i saw that there's something you do you know the family guy sort of cut scenes i found one
was absolutely hysterical i had to pause the episode have you seen the one way we Popeye the
doctors it's like that that's a speech impediment you probably have a stroke
honestly if you check out youtube the family guy Popeye visited doctors it's hysterical
oh and there was that conversation killer no conversation killers just uh just songs from
murderers because murderers are just like everyone else they need songs too that's right you heard
it here heard it here heard it heard it here felt heart folks of easy for you to say one would say
so there's anyone else has a life changing 2017 then yes also like these these open questions
which i never did yeah i had a life changing 2017 too you got an open answer
it's the problem with yes no questions yeah true i had two back surgeries this year
we're starting to hear that oh no the back surgeries saved me from a lot of pain it was the
it was the need for the back surgeries that that sucked but the surgeries themselves were great
glad they hear that yeah the back's a nightmare when it's not right not right and i've had back
issues for the years as well nothing not not serious but uh yeah even even the main of things in
the back that actually have not as serious as disclosure full disclosure serious satellite the star
crickets it's a text joke Casper well what that was leading up to is i know that i've no
i've no spoke to i've no done any of the online stuff for a long time um but i figured i know a lot
of people here and i thought come on every new year and i sort of catch up and up until now every year
for me is pretty much being the same 2017 i had something major um i found out over the last few
months i have i'm on the autistic spectrum i have i've i've asked about this so my whole life
is basically switched upside down on that i know i was doing a lot of shit that shouldn't have been
doing and you know i'm still trying to get used to that but anyway so what how many undiagnosed
as burgers there are among the geek crowd i was just thinking how many in this room alone
so Gordon let's see how many are in the room so Gordon it's a wide spectrum
well how many of us are on the spectrum probably everyone yeah everyone's on the spectrum somewhere
yeah that's the part of the spectrum i find it over the last five to ten years i mean it
pretty much is a broad swath of the population Gordon can you uh go into details on how this
discovery became apparent this just this year right so um i had been i had been told by different
people that at work things like i don't appreciate the way you're talking to me or things that i
would just misunderstand things or miss hear things or just something wasn't quite right i wouldn't
notice when i was offending someone unless it was a a really exaggerated response and so there
are a lot of these things all clicked at the same time and back in about august maybe
i happened to be reading an article on a opinion piece on a guy that what it was like to discover
you've got autism and middle age and i've read that and for some reason the links that it took me
as an idea of what autism was i'm always i'm the kind of person i'm gonna see something i'm
sort of curious like watching um watching a movie and one of the characters reading my chalk sticks
and i'm like oh wonder how you do that um and get chalk sticks and get only youtube and certain
what what can we do it just just because and it was doing that i thought i wonder i don't even know
what autism is and just to be able to describe in things like actually that sounds quite quite
kind of familiar and i inadvertently went down the path of aspergers when i was doing some research
and came across what looked like two or three like genuine medical uh sites explaining the the
common things of um of aspergers and of autism and an ESD and all that kind of stuff did one online
test scored really high uh then then another online test scored really high a second time
and like you know what i think uh i think i'm better getting this checked and the more i look to
the symptoms then the more it was like this sort of veil was lifted but for all my life i've had
this other person with me that sort of sticks forward at various times and now for the first time
i can finally see it and i can see the the sort of things that that sort of triggered me
and the more the more i think about um things that have happened in the past have led me down
different paths um the more i'm thinking yeah it's obvious now in hindsight now that's exactly
what it was um i didn't know what triggered me what made it wash i don't know um i didn't know
anything how to make it to minimize it never do it now i'm aware of it um yeah but so that's been
the last sort of three or four months i've had two psychiatry appointments and they at the end of
the second one uh so i've got my official diagnosis and you pretty much back in august maybe
july maybe august that it was one of these things but i don't think i have this and nor have this um
i just need to get it officially verified by a professional and then it goes in my medical record
so it's not about i don't see it as a bad thing i just get it as i think it's just a thing um it's
part of who i am uh and i've basically learned a lot more about myself this year than
than i've ever done before um and because of that actually 2018 i've now got plans for 2018 for
the first time my life i've got plans for 2018 i've just come in on this conversation i'll just
have some of this um so i missed a lot obviously as well but uh actually there was a question here
i think who has autism or well apparently lots of technical people actually have autism
technical people but linox people uh probably a lot of people listening to this uh some some
mess some people are diagnosed and and that's known others are not um but it's just it's just one
of those things there's always names various things but to confuse the whole situation as well
actually asparagus autism um it's all just autism now so and there's a massive spectrum with
well some people are on it a tiny little bit some people are somewhere in the middle some people
are high functional symptoms and one of the top of you know yeah i know that i mean when i was
researching i went from knowing nothing about it back in august of july and when i was looking
there was some people were calling it uh where classmate is asparagus and there's various
different sort of terms and some people were and and all that and all that stuff but uh yeah it
feels like all a lot of the things that i've not even realized were part of me um i now know
i now know that and i now know what i can do with it and i play it in my strengths and i was
going to just and i'll be back in a minute i'll meet your tunes and use it also with autism uh
apparently it's mostly men or boys who have it although there are girls out there women with it as
well but they will have it in different ways they may even be able to hide it easier and so just
just to stick so that it's mostly males but yeah i just still maintain you have to be slightly
screwed up in the head to want to work with computers maybe well a lot of people who
who who do have autism or asparagus or possibly even ADHD i guess they do work with computers
i must be really messed up because i've been working with computers for 40 years
i i'm coming up there i'm uh well working with officially about 20 years but messing around when
i was you know eight yeah that's 30 something years now and most people don't really understand
computers and so there's a lot of people who do have or to know i know i know for a fact that
generally speaking that people who are very technical for example people doing some of the most
you know complicated things we could be with Linux or opus or software it could be some of the
calendars or other post for example or somebody's doing something you know really complicated
projects a lot of those people would probably actually go go go down there's having autism
also know that Richard Stulman who i'm sure we all know who that is or generally speaking
does actually have autism or he has a various book it says so in his book i've seen as you know
it's been his speeches but it's not just Tim now there are various other people out there
i believe don't even somebody like Bill Gates or can't remember quite somebody like that
also had autism actually and you know various examples you can come up on google it's just one of
those things yeah you need a certain mindset for some of this you know you've got to be able to
detail oriented you've got to focus on something and sometimes you can just focus on one thing
for several hours and so you need that sort of mindset and it's like left and right handed no one
is like just left handed or no one is just right handed it's just that there's a sliding scale
and it's so i'm lefty i do pretty much everything left handed but there's a few things i do right
handed um but it's not a case of like you know you you are autistic you're not there's a sliding
scale so it's not just you are you not you're a little bit or you're it's it frustrates me that
that everyone seems to you we have to put you in your box we have to label everything you know
so we've got it you're autistic you're asparagus you're left handed you're ambidextrous you're
whatever we need to dislike why we're all people there's it's sliding scales for everything
it's not yes you are no you're not it's like yeah you're a little bit or a little
yeah you might be determined predetermined to or be exposed to do this a bit more but it's not
yeah it's not yeah i agree with that it's it's that's yeah autism ADHD um
larish other things like this you know it's it's a label it's a name it's it's down to society as well
you got you got to you got to label it you got it's like the anxiety wants to put a name on
everything and it's called it's sort of all the way and annoying the thing with autism is that
a wasp is that because of what society is like as well in general general speaking it's seen
as a bad thing by a lot of people who don't really understand it because because they are seen as
being different from the majority of other people probably more so in the younger ages actually
um like teenagers and all this you know early 20s possibly still um and generally people get a
little bit more not always but generally speaking people get a little bit more accepting
i i believe as they get older of people who other people who are different to them like i said
not always but generally speaking and there isn't a society is obsessed with what is normal um
you know it's not just autism and things like this it could be it could be people who are gay or
things like that and in as various things that society has a has it kind of obsession with
and if you if you are if you're if you're not that then you're the other thing and then it's seen
as being weird possibly and you know and so it goes on and that's that's a bad thing really but
that's how it is at the moment but things slowly change it seems over time things get more accepted
well depends a bit on more countries as well what we're talking about but generally speaking
so the reason i mentioned it in here is the fact that i've known a lot of you guys for quite a while
the last sort of 10 years or so i've been doing the podcast i see thing and then i've done
dark for a few few years i've had a lot of interactions with a lot of you guys over the years
and i'm just saying that up until now that's been affected and how i interact with people
but i've not been aware of it until now that's that's why i'm sitting here i i missed
the very beginning of the discussion or whether but um but that's something else actually
i don't know if this is what you're saying quite what i'm trying to say but actually this is
i've just thought of something else people who do have apparently autism or asperger's or
as it or all things like this you know you'll find the online world a lot easier that could be
podcasting it could be rfc but to communicate with people i'm not so much more relaxed seeing
this easier than in person in person could be quite difficult because of various reasons including
if you could be the obvious common one that you're lacking eye contacts in person if you've got
autism there's a common one that people come up with it's like like an eye contact where's my
fucking webcam yeah that's just what i'm saying when you've got things like that you're like oh yeah
that's me oh and that's me and i've got some of that oh yeah and i kind of do that as well um i
get that it's not going back on a one of one of those points for the theory like a second
i know it's a spectrum i don't i get the thing of putting a label on it and putting a box and
whatever for me that's that's no what it's about for me it's about i want some sort of a thing
that i can focus as a search term and and find out right other people in this broad spectrum at
other people with this kind of label um what do they do to minimize to to change their working
environment what kind of jobs do they do what can our working environments what can our home
environments what can our routines what kind of things do they do that help them because the way
that i see this is under certain stimuli my this other part of me takes over and i'm just i've
just not been aware of it until now now i'm i'm looking at that and saying i've got to keep that
as long as i keep my environment reasonably decent and i can cope with it then i can keep that
in the back burner and i can focus on on my strengths basically and i can achieve a hell of a lot
more than i have been able to up and down there i think uh well something i think will do
however you may at the point actually with something like cortism like technology compute science
all this kind of stuff because it's logical thinking you have to focus on lots of hours
so you have to really focus on one thing you have a lot of concentration and so a lot of people
who do have all autism mass barely are going to find these things easier um that's
a good point and then apparently what they generally say is that people as well that people with
autism or asperger's uh have a special interest so in the case of males uh that that's very common
actually to be technology computers in the case the women or girls i'm not sure quite but it will
be something else uh maybe they may be very sucked into the books the fiction reading but not just
liking books but to the extreme end or not i'm not sure quite maybe it's different um
and and yeah yeah don't basically another part of this is um up until now i've built all the
last two or three years um i've just had the been online at all um that's all starting to change
in the new year i'm setting up a new website i'll keep the details to myself at the moment because
it's just a bulk standard dripple install at the moment well by the way dripple eight is fantastic
i i've not i've not played with dripple since dripple six a good few years ago now dripple eight is
fantastic um yeah so i've got my plans for 2018 for the first time in a long time and i can actually
play it in my strengths well was that you're going to come online now is that what you're saying?
oh yeah that was that i sort of we would grow there um well no um not so much because what i found
out is the the constant interruptions to a team don't work well with me i find that at work and
and i'm sort of seeing Twitter like that as well any kind of social media is kind of like that
where it's just constant disruptions and i don't get stuff done um so the idea is i'm coming back
online to do music stuff and i'm learning about development as well i've got ideas for a few apps
but most of the social stuff is going to be um it's not not going to be on social media i'm not
going to be doing blogs and things like that because that just find that adds kind of pressure
to produce something or mood something out in x minute time and it just ends up i end up being
in the deer in the headlights um when i've got ongoing content um so the idea is going to be a static
page with um uh with music updated the naps and things like that but pretty much no more social
presence now right uh right although although you've got to be clear in zero really good at that
but um but i was trying to make as well earlier and i i should i'll try to make this point again
actually is is that because on the subject of autism or all we were um is that uh a lot of people
actually who who do have autism or aspect of all these kind of things will find as i was saying
the the online world a lot easier to interact in because you know you're saying your home or
ever you're not really with people in person um so you can you can be yourself more so online
or find it easier and then in person it it's more difficult people can see you the eye contact
all this kind of stuff body language what does the body language say that's something else
because people with autism parent generally speaking uh a lot of them find the hard to
to read body language or so they say and um the other thing as well with the whole online world
is that as great as it is or it can be it is also it can also be a bad thing at times because
and this happens not just to people with autism or or these things but actually generally speaking
is and i like what somebody said here earlier earlier on they said about mobile phones about
being like a drug these days or if it was if it were being like that would be in a drug because
people are just addicted to it the whole social media online the mobile phones and and not
interacting enough in person because of that probably as well um i mean people who have had
Christmas just now sitting on their phones for the most part possibly even texting something in
the same room or nearby so chance of them that's how bad it can be these days and that i think
is a bad thing the other thing with online is that i know there are people online who do have autism
and the particular girl who comes to mind from um chicago who i who i've come across online a few
years back on three node and and i know where to find her today and she basically she has about
26 now i believe 26 years old but she does not um does not really have any friends as such i believe
and she's not working with any of this for education or any of that so she's mostly online
and not just hers are very so the people like that so they basically hang there a six-year
chill out on youtube they that's how they spend their life or compute the games for the most part
and that's basically what they do not not that much contact with people in person on the phone or any
of this and you know so that's kind of the bad side of online or depending on how it's looked at
as well and Gordon your point about uh sort of being like a different person or with with autism
mass burgers um i think that's that's probably correct generally speaking a lot of people would
use these things because it kind of takes over it takes over and it affects and you don't always
realize that it's there cause uh doing it's thing or you do afterwards sometimes when it's too late
for example it could be like uh trying to chat to girls online or something and then and then
you're sending them the wrong thing on these sites and then i don't know if you know if people
doing general but you know and then you think realize this afterwards and then girls think
differently anyway usually and that's just one example but you know it's very things
yeah i mean certainly the eye contact that's something i never even noticed i had an issue with
but yeah and to assume that realize this read it in the last actually yeah i do that a lot um yeah
i mean there's just so many different aspects of that and it's like the way that i would describe it
as it's like under certain stimuli and i'm trying to explain to someone but i'm at work and i'm
trying to explain something to a manager to get some help and they're they've got a big line of
people to see um so i've got to get all my story out within sort of 30 seconds to explain what
it is i need to help with and if i'm if i'm not able to take and i explain that and they're going
off from the wrong track and i'm trying to correct them it's like no and that's not what i'm talking
about i mean this um and it just gets and because i miss hear them or misunderstand them and they
and i can't communicate right myself it's just a kind of download spiral it's like a plane just
just spiraling down towards earth none i can bear but and i get more and more angry and more and more
sarcastic and just frustrated and and even to remember and things like i remember such and such
happened and i actually probably didn't have like that i was a wee just a bit annoyed at the time
and i picked it up wrong and i've thought it happened a different way um so a very unreliable
witness um or being told like um that i'm being aggressive or whatever and i'm like i don't i
i'm not tentendent i'm trying to do it honestly trying not trying to be aggressive i'm a pass
of us but why why why um but it's taken until now to realize that it's almost like
under certain stimuli this other force kind of steps forward and takes control so i can
remember everything i can i'm aware of everything it's just scrambled it's utterly scrambled uh
and anything could be the outcome and that's more good for anyone know me for not enough for the
people i'm talking to so at least now i'm aware that under these kind of circumstances i just need
to take a step back and realize that yeah this this is happening again step back relax and have
another go at it the other thing as well uh of the sort of related i guess really is that i mean
we're talking about like we're using we're using work here as an example so managers i assume
is what we're talking about really so i'm gonna say managers and colleagues and things like this
and it doesn't have to work necessarily it could be a social group and talking i'm trying to
talk in general but like no autism in general as well so trying to kind of do that but that but
basically yeah so body languages are talking about eye contact tones of voice all this stuff
the way you possibly move around somebody moves around and or doesn't move around in a certain
situation or all this stuff uh yeah you know if people do it in a certain way it's all like
or shaking hands in certain situations if you shake hands okay or not
greeting somebody with shaking hands possibly all this all this kind of stuff that we kind of
can we do with humans or what apparently do or meant to do or you know depending on the situation
if we do it in the correct way or the so-called correct way or for the most part then it's
probably just like yeah fine okay yeah right if we do it in a sort of different way
and depending on what's done how noticeable it is then then we get commented on
possibly or people notice it and they think oh you're you're being aggressive or you're
being you're you're being whatever and it's like no i'm not or or they don't understand why won't
you shake my hand or you mean because you could have or something but autism because we could put
OCD in here and things like this you maybe don't want to shake hands with somebody because
you have got obsessive compulsive disorder and you you generally think that they are not as clean
or whatever that you know it doesn't matter but point is that people always
that if depending what's done if they notice that something's different they will they
and they think especially if they think they are the so-called normal one or any of this then
then they're going to be like oh you're doing this one they might even quit by name on this and
go oh you've got autism or you've got this or you've got that and that that's that's a bit annoying
really but that's also how it is in this society I suppose and I think my point was sort of
clear but we'll see yeah the rumbly clear man no I a lot of you're saying right enough and I've
got some of that and for me the reason I was mentioning this is I've often tell now
when I'm now 40 or be 45 in January I have never been so awakened as I have what we
will go up I've evolved basically over the last four or five months I've became a different person
and even coming into 2018 as well by the end of 2018 I'll talk about properly evolve
it's taking so long but that's just for all the kind of interactions I've had with people
I've been in arguments and whatever I apologize like that's this has been part of me and I've
never realized it until now I know do and I'm sort of becoming someone else you know Gordon the
last thing you were talking about how certain interactions people maybe don't call the way
you thought they did or whatnot it kind of reminds me of something that I've had to do a lot of
lately or it's not had to but kind of made a habit of doing a lot of times I'll think that a
conversation has gone wrong or that maybe I've said something I shouldn't or someone took it the
wrong way and I found that just like you said take a step back and sometimes it's taking a step
back for a little bit sometimes it's taking a step back for quite a while but I'll address it with
the person and just say hey when we spoke this is how I thought that went and I you know if it did
I didn't intend that and I apologize if it was taken that way but I could see how it would be because
you know that's what I thought yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think but I'll sorry to interrupt
I'll have to a little bit there but I think I think that's a nice point and that's something else
that because Jen generally speak if yeah yeah if you've got autism I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm going to do the unthinkable here normally part of the the autism and definitely something I
have as I am completely oblivious to social cues and social body language and things like that
and just things that normal people just consider they just got on with it and on but on that note
that's now midnight in a new time zone so half a new year to everyone in that new time zone
yes so I'm not I don't have to list the time zones but that'll be Helsinki in Finland in the new
year that will be Egypt I believe all of Egypt now and I guess I don't have the actual list
what else is plus two from the UK turkey or somewhere maybe and there's a few others as well
yeah Kevin Woescher thanks for pointing that out to us that it was a midnight time slot
you happen to have the list you know who's new year it is right now there's a link to
etherpad on the hacker public website yeah it's going to be some it's going to be somewhere
just an inside Europe we're in the UK I presume seven I had both on the UK we're at 10 o'clock
just now so a couple of years ahead of us so the list is Cairo and Cara anthems and Booker
rest cool thanks for that glad to you're already in tomorrow aren't you
class here even here I don't want to I'd like to continue the autism chat a bit longer
because we've got in something here but yeah social cues that's another thing is yeah you
you know if you've got autism you're gonna you know find it miss things and focus talking about
apologizing to when you've upset somebody and this kind of thing will not hang on a second not
specifically apologizing I mean sometimes it it has to be apologized but more just addressing
situation very often I'll address in it I'll address it and the person will say no it's
how I took it all we're fine and that's enough to just get it off my conscience um sometimes
you know the person may take it the wrong way and and I've tried in the past few years to
also be specific with my apologies when I do have to apologize for stuff you know I'll try to
apologize because if you have an argument with somebody or misunderstanding it's always two sides
to it so I try to identify my part of it and apologize for what I got wrong or what I did wrong
that made the other person you know uh not feel so good I try to be specific about that and
um that works better than you know the way I used to do it I'm sorry you're upset that doesn't
really work it's uh you know I'm sorry I said this the wrong way I didn't realize how it could be
taken you know when when I was framing it the person like stuff like that but you know it's not
always apologizing just addressing it I find it useful to address a situation sometimes I find it
necessary um just to make sure that I'm not on the wrong page with someone and sometimes it has
you know been that way that that you know I came across wrong and I didn't realize it until later
that oh I could have sounded like a real jerk there yeah speak to the person and say yeah you
were a real jerk okay well I'm sorry I didn't mean it I meant it this other way and it helps to
clear the air co-workers I like the idea at the sound of that like yeah so if there is let's say
with some standing or something done wrong that could be something in person of some you know
an argument or just something in general it could maybe even be a date a date you went on with
somebody or sort of meet up for somebody and then it went wrong and um now that you don't always
with those in particular of course you're not always going to get an opportunity to then find out
later what won't wrong with this girl but you know um or woman uh but at times you may get the
opportunity and and I I do I like I mean I like the idea in general of like something's gone wrong
here let's find out what really went wrong with that person and I think I think I think I think
it's good it sounds like a nice idea to take the opportunity and find out as much as possible when
you can do that but in reality obviously you can't always do it it wasn't it wasn't really the point
Pokey was making but but uh yeah make sure you want to apologize for things that you didn't do
as well you don't want to over-appologize there's a beaten dog syndrome you can get into and you
oh I'm sorry oh I'm sorry no you did a good job oh I'm sorry but you can under-appologize us
that's for sure but I think it's it's always good to over-forgive and and look at look at things
through other people's eyes because you'd be surprised uh how how peaceful your life becomes
when you uh don't hold hold anything against people yeah yeah yeah I just want to quote this
and then say something and I'm going to quote this bit look at things for other people's eyes and
I hope Gordon's still here as well as I say this because that's something else they they do
tell the time that people with autism lack empathy which is is it's not quite true it can
vary a bit on person but you know I reckon it's not it's not true really but I mean they say
that people will also lack empathy it's more like people with autism more these things probably
actually see the world differently and social situations differently to uh marry other people
so it's not it's not about empathy is sort of but it's more nuanced than that I experience the
same things as other people it's just I don't necessarily show it in the same way um so so for
people looking at me thinking this is a moment where you should be really sad and I'm just
not feeling anything um I still feel it I just I just don't show it in the same way as everyone else
and I make sure it's that strange ways um that work outside of the social can a norm
but well yeah that's basically it that's exactly yeah that's that's it
oh good sorry yeah I think uh what was that you can hear again thanks just confirm
hey can happy new year hi just wanted to come on and apologize to you
to me yeah for that crappy thing sorry no no I told you uh already that was no need to apologize it
was perfect it was a perfect troll everybody loved it I don't know
it's hilarious yeah because back to my point sorry yeah we were just talking about
over apologizing and uh you're over apologizing now Ken it was great no that was actually a good
that was one of the a lot of the time um I wouldn't have picked up a knob but that's and we'll
we'll play so we'll play I want to apologize that advance in fact can I should probably thank you
for it because it really it even made me take a closer look at my position and maybe even adjust
it a little so if anything I should be thanking you for it it was it was a good troll though no
I mean I am a bit uh in emails it's very difficult to get to strike the right tone as all
and and also with this weird thing that you talked to somebody maybe once a year and you I
see the people on this chat as my friends so to speak and yes you know if if we walked past
each other in a street we wouldn't recognize each other you know what I mean but
it's just kind of weird I think that's interesting with this stuff as well because now
there we've got basically the IRC and then we got podcasting which yeah so your various next names
and IRC and you got your name or podcast and then you go to these conferences and I've been some
and uh you know you get you start getting people going like I remember you from
do or I and it's like what I don't remember you where to talk to you oh oh yeah and it's not
just that because then you have to build names with one thing and you've got IRC name to your
podcast names and yeah generally speaking if any of us walk down the street we're not going to
recognize each other or go to any of these conferences unless you know somebody from now ready or
all got to know them that's why I just smile and nod at everybody just in case you're one of you
guys well that's a good rule of thumb and gonna do that on the train pretend all these people that
are annoying me are you guys I'll be fine there's some quote from someone that says just smile
at everyone they'll be so confused as to what that you're smiling at it's the exact truth that
if you give somebody a smile or don't react when they when they do something that could be
uh could be against you it really messes with them I don't know what you're up to
I have a story that I can tell real quickly uh Gordon to really emphasize that point
um a friend of mine came to my house one time and and he had just broken up with his girlfriend
and it was having a real hard time with it and he won up getting in trouble with the cops and
he wound up getting arrested over it and the only question they had for him was hey who's
that guy whose house you were at when we arrested you and why is he always waving to us
okay see they just they weren't used to someone waving to them I would always wave at the cops as
I drove past them just say how you doing good morning they had no idea who's the guy and why is
you always waving that's a perfectly normal thing to do surely avoid at that all costs aliens
won't suggest you just avoid because it seems like no matter what you do they me shoot
kill with killing with kindness yeah there is there is that thing about any interaction with cops
and what doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter how innocent you are you always at guilty of
at least something doesn't matter how well you crawl towards them under instructions you will you
make a kill the other thing I've noticed is the exact opposite of that when I'm driving if someone
makes a really bad move in a car if you ever flip them off it's almost like they're satisfied
like they're happy that they pissed somebody off but if you give them a thumbs down it drives people
nuts they go crazy I do want to take this opportunity to over apologize because I'm certain it'll
it'll probably be appropriate uh sometime during the evening apologies in advance that's that's the
key well guys you're missing it here it's a tradition now whatever you guys do it's personas that
you're doing sorry about that you've been listening to hecka public radio at hecka public radio
