Good evening everybody. My name is Ken Fallon and I'm your listen to another episode of Hacker
Public Radio Community News for December 2016. This is a show that we do every month
to give people a background into what's going on in the HBR community. How are you Dave?
How's things? It's good thanks it's good it's it's Edinburgh it's cold it's sometimes quite
horrible weather but I'm sure it's not that wonderful where you are either. No it's kind of cold and
misty so it's been a it's been an interesting all month some bad news for the show that I want to
get out of want to discuss first and that's Lord Dragon Blut passed away he had a long fight with
cancer and unfortunately he lost that battle he was a good friend of HBR he was a good friend of
today with a techie and he will be sorely missed he influenced lots of people his work is still
available here on HBR it's available on archive.org so his legacy of education and motivation will
continue it's it's strange because it's directly because of him I'm currently running for Dora
so it's it's funny how somebody can have even the influence on your life well yes yes yeah I know
it's it's very sad when I first heard that he was suffering from the the thing that killed him
the cancer I have to admit that that made me think again you know when you hear somebody
ill you think well I wonder if I should I get myself checked and I did for that specific thing
and I and I got a clear bill of health because I had symptoms that might have been similar I don't
know I've never actually spoken to him about it or anything but those sort of these self-adjual
things are not that uncommon so catching it early is important and he he left behind a little girl
as well and yeah that's that's really hit me with you know I haven't three kids and
yes absolutely and very young in his early 30s so that's a very very tragic thing big big loss
to the community you know HBR and before that he was involved with the infinomic and computer
club as well I never actually got to meet him and he was just one of these people that you know
was around you know he was on my list of you know people you could you could guarantee to get a
show from if if I needed a show you know if that day ever came that you know there's a list of
people that I know you're on that list tattoos on that list you know Kevin Wishers on the list
you know the regulars are on the list and Lordeem was one of the guys who if I needed a show
I know I'd get a show from him just fire him off an email but there you go it's yeah and all
that brilliant work he did it which was a conference he he did stuff from I forgot that yeah but
that that was that was very good actually it's very some brilliant interviews he did yeah absolutely
excellent anyway tattoo is organizing a eulogy thing so if you if you knew Lordeer he influenced
your life in some way can you fire off an email to a tattoo or fire it off to us and we'll make
sure that tattoo gets that so that is the bad news and now for some good news I guess is honky
McGoo and the guys over at the Linux logcast are taking over they are not taking over Kevin
Wishers going to be doing the stream John Newsteader's mumble server Tash is going to do the
etherpad and they're going to be doing the new year show this is now how many years that we've been
doing it woman let me four five don't know let me just check one second fifth year trunkate silence
hopefully we'll be doing this works and your hacker and public radio show will be available
for your delectations starting tomorrow actually as 10 am I need to remember oh that's when I'm
actually going to work so I need to remember to start the stream so we'll be starting tomorrow
which will be actually far far too late because by the time you hear this it'll already have a
card so so not not to worry about that but yes you look forward to that coming down your podcast
land very very soon cool cool cool hey by the way Ken your chip monkey voice is still still happening
I just thought you know what to point out as people listening to this in the in the future
what's happened to Ken why does he sound like that well we don't know what's happened but it's
don't seem to be able to fix it is that right well to be honest I had to work 11 hours today so
I got home completely forgot about this ran in and just plugged in the mic so I'm talking chip monkey
I'm talking chip monkey it'll it'll happen before and I thought it was linked to
to the software I was using but now anyway this is HPR it's not about the audio quality it's
about their contents yep so long as one of us not chip monkey I should try and speak very deep
and slow okay how about I do this then we have a call for shows at the moment because we're
running quite low so but by the time you hear this hopefully somebody will have submitted a show
so let's have a look at that anyway so much for doing a quick show Dave and we have no new host
this month that is very sad news for me very very sad news guys why do we have no new hosts
it's one of those things can't have them every month or I'm sure you could I'm sure you could
now let us do the reviews of the shows platoon doing tabletop gaming which I believe is a series
yes it is tabletop series and it was dungeon year RPG card game if you're keen to play and you want
to use the rewrite platoon's rewrite of the official rules or as rewrite touchups of the unofficial
rules neither of these are unique and soft but platoon humbly believes that they're a lot easier to
comprehend than the online or in the box yes I I had to go and have a look and see see what they look
like and of course he's done a brilliant job they look really really good he is yeah it is
he's quite good at this stuff and he has tapped into a another a seam of HBOR type shows which
I'm very glad to see because I'm always I'm always happy when the new video opens up you know
like a John Cobb's car this has been one of the best things for HBOR episodes
that's very true John was John was here a little while ago by the way he's in on he's on holiday
at the moment but he's he's got better things to do obviously then yeah sorry I'll just
jump for an up in here on time just acknowledge it and he said he was he's in Honolulu and I had
a complete and that's a brain fart and couldn't couldn't work out where the hell Honolulu is so
there you go anyway back to yes back to shows we actually got some a tabletop game here and we've
been playing with the kids and I'm actually contemplating doing a review but it wouldn't be a good
review so I'm not 100% sure that I really want that my first show would be a negative review of
a BOR game but so anyway we'll see were there any comments Dave on that one there were no comments
on that one so Katie part for color correction a review of the Katie color correction sweet by
Gettys who is doing an awesome episode and I deliberately listened to this one without without
reading it and I felt I could follow it very well he has a wonderful voice for this sort of thing
yeah it does a lovely job doesn't it yeah yeah it sounds just a tad low but you know it's
it was very very very nice and clear that's just because you're used to my chip monkey voice nowadays
it's because I'm getting deaf probably it's don't blame yet it's so on the community news episode
there were which was the following day clarky our resident northern what do we call this
Scandinavian correct my doider which is de-order so it's de-order which is plans rather close to
de-order so guess what Dave I got my this was about the blinks tick that I was getting which I got
and I got one of these de-order things and there's an instruction on how to do it on the blinks tick
website guess what Dave they have a new PCB in the thing so again oh no oh yes oh no you
should contact the blinks tick people because I found it into the very very responsive to comments
and questions and stuff check it out it's cool because he's got you know he's got a nice
you know handwritten you know on the invoice that you get it's a handwritten jerican enjoy your
blinks tick and thingy with a smiley face it's kind of nice so I might give him a drop in the line
because I'm actually interested in this just got the one with the that you can power LED strip
as well so I have a few questions I don't really want to blow it up so I think I know what's
going to work so I'm just going to fire them off and you'll see if that helps yeah here's yeah
definitely recommend contacting him he's he's helped me out with one or two things in the days
when I was starting messing around with these things so go for it do you want to do the next comment
the longer one so yes this is claque again I'm saying it right yes yes claque claque is definitely
now right I was a new to you to go my job here is to butcher people's names so yes he's talking about
overview of slack alternatives so he's talking about shall I read it out verbatim it's quite long
yeah probably bring this up again in my coming overview of slack alternatives yes I know what you're
such a show but before I forget the problems with naked xmpp with multiple clients with clients
coming and going are these if nobody is online at the moment your message will be lost in cyberspace
and you may or may not be told that this happened yes indeed if you have several clients online
they have priorities set to determine which client should get the messages delivered to it so what
these xmps do is that they add the ability to store and forward so the server holds any incoming
messages and delivers them when you get back online and secondly carbon copy which means all
clients currently connectable get any incoming messages rather than just one of the clients
thirdly message store which I'm sure I'm not I'm not sure how it's handled but I suppose the server
can back fill the connecting clients so that any messages received since last time will be sent to
it even if other clients have already received those messages I'm just inferring this from comments
and from the titles of the extensions I haven't actually used them talking about naked xmpp
is probably not fair because these extensions are supported by several xmpp servers including
the original e java d project and the rather popular prosody project okay cool thank you
and clacky sends another one gone arousing regular expressions I did not make the rejects comment
in a sort of ha ha only seriously frame of mind not allude one my initial reaction was amusement
that anyone would make the apparently futile attempt to convey rejects over audio followed by
the love of the hacker ask pure devotion to the medium that would drive someone to make a serious
effort followed by a certain level of surprise and delight that the rejects unsusable as it is for
audio actually carried over and was understandable so part friendly mockery part genuine delish
well personally I think that show from now on any show that mentions rejects should get an
explicit tag what's your reckon they yes yes don't go there I'm not saying anything no no no but
yes the it's he's raising a point that's always I always hesitate over because I do this I
I read out regular expressions and all this sort of stuff and I wonder sometimes that I really
shouldn't be trying but then how else to communicate it is meant to be something you're talking about
and then pointing at a written example or something and we hope that somebody's following along
with the written example so yeah it's it's a problem but I still think it's worth doing
personally yeah it's a nice reply very because we we defend quite a lot of time laughing at
them last week inferring that regular expressions was in some way a niche fetish of somebody on the
internet so yes very good yes to share I think it's a indeed indeed Steve said ham radio topics
this is not the first time Ken has met a call for ham radio topics I would be interested in
willing to do some shows on the topics but I struggle a little to know how to approach it what
will the show what show would you like to see an overview show of the hubby show of any specific
topics with anyone like to cover collaborate is series what would you like to see Ken answer yes
everything and overview of the show of the hubby yes a show on a specific topic yes and would you
like to cover collaboration the series absolutely yes 100% yes yes yes yes yes and yes followed by yes
so all of the above and and quickly please yes that it think about the start you know nothing
about ham radio and I'll be that guy because I have so many questions and so and there's a guy
Mark who now is avoiding talking to me because he's a ham radio guy and he sits down for a lunch and
it's like oh you know completely discussing the difference between a capacitor and a
why why is for example today's question yeah and people can actually answer this a capacitor yes
is a bit like a a a not a but a ballast the bladder bladder you know in a mechanical engineering
you you you have a bladder that fills up and then it empties out again so it's like a balloon
kind of thing for electricity so it fills it up and then they air you fill it up a water I guess
and then the water flows back fill it up a water and the water falls back so it is sort of passing
AC current and it doesn't pass DC current the water goes in and that's it stops because it doesn't
pass DC current yes the books seem to refer to the fact that it does allow a little bit of DC current
so I'm not sure I'd like things and capacitors I like things and radios how to build a crystal
radio how to get started what you need to do your ham radio exam where can you do you have a radio
exam what are the frequencies allocated in different countries what are the different topics that
you can evolve in how to get a good radio how to pick a good radio how do you get a second hand
radio yeah I could go on and I'm more than happy to do this as as you can tell you see the problem
with this is like I've got interested in ham radio in order to get into electronics so it's not
the goal itself it's they I just want to know everything about everything and every time I touch
something I kind of need to know all about these components it's not enough to know about a
capacitor I need to know about a resistor and thingy and thingy so there you go yes yes I've been
told because I'm probably a similar similar level lower level I've been told try not to use
plumbing analogies when it comes to electronics and electricity and stuff because it works but only
up to a point and then you're really in a mess no no that's fine I can I can get that but
it looks it works like this but it doesn't because you know there's a certain amount of
so like with a diode stops electricity going through but there is a backward voltage that
goes through I can get that you know I I understand but for a capacitor when they're
expanding it to say no current passes through to the other side and yes when later on when
they're describing it it works a bit like this and then there's some DC current that goes through
so I'm a bit confused so it's just me maybe maybe it's just I yeah I couldn't I don't think I
could answer although I do know that they're used in when you turn AC to DC and and bridge rectifiers
and all that sort of good stuff if there are only some like electronic engineers on the netter
who could explain these things people with experience with oscilloscopes for example which will
be another good show how to use an oscilloscope how to use a voltmeter you know even a power
voltmeter what voltmeter would you get where do you use it what are the dangerous things why are
there two connectors why are there two holes in the voltmeter blah blah blah blah anyway Steve if
you want to do a show with me it would be awesome we need to pick a time when it would be available
to do that cool very cool I think I've talked enough about that so the following day was sorry
for going off and ran to everybody I just imagine now listening to this chipmunk going off on
on a hammer radio knowledge following day was knowledge interconnection and the tie express hack
learn things that empower you and intellect you with others of your knowledge by spaceman you can
practice programming away from the keyboard and hacking at the same time so he gives the example
of going into a toy restaurant and using using reuse in the bag and stuff so there were 10
comments on this and I'm going to there's been quite a few comments on the rest of the show I'm
going to hold all of all of those comments if that's okay till the end where I basically he has
you oh okay I'll do it now so he has spaceman has used some explicit language and people met
the fair point that they not in this comment put on other shows that HPR the assume it's a
friendly podcast and in actual fact it can be if you subscribe to the clean feed and details
on how to do that if you go to the to the HPR website and you go to get shows then you have an
RSS syndication page and you have a list of all the org feeds the two week org speaks and
MP3 which we're not supposed to use and then the entire audio feed which you got to be careful that's
a massive massive big feed then under advanced settings there are several different options that
you can apply you can put in explicit equals zero so that will give you display the host content
display content marked as clean by our host so only the clean content all the other stuff
marked as explicit will be will be filtered out for you so you're going to guess
less shows but there will be quote clean and you that is with caveat that that's up to each individual
host in order to do that so if you go to the give shows page you are agreeing to two things
you're agreeing to lots of things so I'm going to show on this if you don't have time to listen
to all of this the last show of the year will be gone through all this explaining what the HPR
policies and procedures are right now where they come from how you can influence them and all
that good stuff so you show will not be moderated so I'll just read that off we do not vet
moderator sensor only shows on the network which was due to do that and that's also so we don't
do any moderation but we also there's an element of trust involved in that and we do check for
audio quality and spam so if we do get spam shows coming in they will get deleted without
without fear or remorse and if there's any doubt to whether it's spam or not we'll send an email
out on the mailing list but I think that we're pretty good at identifying spam at this stage
we know yeah we've got better over time yes because when we there about four or five years ago
the site was absolutely overrun with spam which is why we approve all the comments as well
and we put them in the uh akameh akameh the spam checker filter software in there
so um okay I will continue on here the other point is your show will be signaled as having
explicit content and that means that it will be inoffensive in every region of the world
so when dealing with explicit content uh that is best suited for mature audience it has become
traditional to include a short warning at the very beginning of the show before the intro
to allow listeners time to switch off the episodes should this will desire so that is um that is
the thing now one important thing that uh I would like to point out that there was a bug in the code
and as a result of that bug all shows were remarked as explicit even though they were clean or not
and in conversations about this topic it's a very valid point was brought up going well this is
just in the XML feed how do I see it on my feed reader so people do want to subscribe to the shows
and we'll know that for example my shows will be marked as explicit but more than likely it's
only a passing uh a passing thing that gets used or your shows are also marked as explicit but
I think you rarely use the f-bomb in your shows so um but I I know that when I've done shows on
IVF and other shows that I plan to do on euthanasia and stuff I will definitely put in a you know
that there's nothing explicit or whatever you know fence there's nothing offensive about those
shows but I do think that at the beginning of those shows I've always put in a you know a warning
for people to know that okay uh this is this is going to contain heavy material that you might want to
you might play the shows in public but you might also want to do it uh at a time when you are
emotionally ready to hear that show or delete it as as the case may be so it is a it is uh the trust
that we have in the various different halls to do that now and I understand that as a new new
contributors come on and new subscribers come on uh which should be the same thing actually
that um there's a perception but all this information has been agreed on the mailing list and it's
also on the website and it will also be read out to you in excruciating detail with a text-to-speech
engine and the last show of the year which you will already have heard by this stage
so that is uh that is pretty much that so in actual fact nothing has changed we don't
censor shows we don't listen to shows beforehand um but we do um want to accommodate the people
who are subscribed to the clean feed so therefore we um uh i have modified two things they on the
website it also says now whether um uh we we've always said it's when it's uh flagged as
greater commons what the license is and we also i'll display the explicitly or clean flag as well
so you can listen to that and as a result of that that automatically gets put into the
text-to-speech at the beginning of the shows so one one kind of gotcha that we got there was that
one of the shows has the f word in it prior to uh saying because it says the title and then prior to
the saying of the explicit flag so i think it might be a nice gesture for people if we could avoid
using um x you know experiment what's the word experimentatives?
expletives that's the money that's i had to think there for a minute no problem
tonkaid silence nobody would notice dude uh if they could avoid using expletives in the introduction
and also in the show notes especially in the introduction because then it'll come up and say
this is an explicit show it's by whoever and then we have the intro coming on and that gives you
the chance to pause the show and move on to the next one so you know barren mind people might be
driving down the highway and 18 wheeler and need to change lane or whatever before that happens so
give people the time and the second thing is uh that i'm a little bit concerned about is putting
uh what's the word again Dave?
expletives without you when you're mounted?
yep in the show notes as well because we do deliver the show notes to other sites like archive
org and i'm a bit concerned that we might violate people's terms of service there so uh that would be
a thing for example um if we were uh rebro Augustine somewhere like uh on the ham radio brands because
we've been talking about ham radio there there's very clear rules about the type of language that
you're allowed to use um and obviously there we will be using the clean feed for that but the
problem is that these shows will still appear in the clean feed uh on the on the website itself
because the website does no concept of clean feed or explicit feed if there's just everything
so you see the sort of problems that we know might run into and if this becomes a problem for
HPR as a project which is dedicated to sharing knowledge i would uh need to pop that to the community
at that point so let's move on to the next uh i'll just give you a quick rundown of some of the
comments that uh yeah it's pretty sweary um use pretty sweary uh explicit vague uh has been part of
there so it has been um it has been flagged i say and stuff so basically this entire discussion so
okay the next show a dice mixer plateau reviews the dice mixing tower this is uh was a pretty
cool device but rather expensive yeah i know i saw it and i thought oh a christmas present for my
daughter because she's very much into some said before game playing she wouldn't she would have
liked one but the price plus shipping could have just been ridiculous i was i was on the site and
i was hovering but yeah it is quite expensive but it looks like a beautiful thing
i really would like to get my hands on one just to put one together but
alas pendigras as they say yeah yeah my son will be in New Zealand in the next year so
okay i'm to pick one up while he's there so then the following day and the day after we have
uh uh clacky with uh mill to myself my first employer oh this was so good this was an absolute
gem of a show that i wanted to you know physically print off and put down where the developers are
there there's no such thing as a temporary fix it will always be his advice like about the
never do a proof of concept do a do a um you know power on presentation and what you think because
if you do a proof of concept it will go into production yes i know exactly what it means yeah
oh absolutely it's some extreme wisdom here as was why he made a note of it's it's it's got some
gems here and it's so so true i've not worked in this sort of environments per se but uh i can see
the the practicality of the advice it's it's amazing yeah dodo dodo dodo dummy said i've only just
started this app but i wanted to stop and comment so many of my prototypes are running in production
as we speak many of them still with original non bugs nobody ever got around fixing i learned
not to be embarrassed over this after all they put them in production and it bothered to fix bugs
for years and years wow i know the feeling i there is a i worked in my first job as a mechanical
engineer and i worked in a company the med shower employers and to this day i walk into DIY shops
around europe and the printing thing that they you know the terminal transfer labels on the thing
are still using the same software that i developed oh my god how do you even find it a uh two
eight six piece each runner line is beyond me wow yeah yeah yeah i know i know it's um as i was leaving
my my job uh sort of hand doing a knowledge transfer to people who are going to be doing similar
sort of stuff that i'd been doing i gave them lots of advice about you know this was all about
registering people to use the university facilities and stuff like that gave them lots of advice
and uh i think as a consultant i was working to consult and i think they because it's part of
that thing where you know the the the argument the thing people say when you in that sort of
environment is oh the best is enemy of the good if you heard that that phrase you know you can't
take it to perfection you just have to make doing game with it but thereby you end up with real
horrible bulges and messes and uh they didn't listen to almost anything i said one of the particular
things i said was make sure you delete the student accounts with people that have left and then a
few years later i was then you've been deleting stuff no have you had any problems yes what were
the problems well we ran out of Microsoft licenses well there you go tell us yeah yeah yeah there
was expression there's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution yeah yeah anyway
yes there's some some excellent wisdom there do you want to read his reply oh sorry yes yes i was
wandering off um okay no hold anyway uh clec says reproto's in production you have a point
maybe my suggestion to make sure the prototype cannot possibly be taken in production is to
extreme i agree with you that one shouldn't uh be embarrassed over it when it happens bad code that
solves a problem and doesn't eat more maintenance resources than it's worth is good code
i think it's one of those pieces of advice that like all ration mark good advice has a dynamic to
it that should not be taken too far in either direction your projectile will be put in production
is a warning as a warning is counteracted by but perfect is the enemy of good i didn't see that
yes yeah but best best is the enemy of the have good yeah yeah yeah if your proof of concept actually
solves the problem maybe it should be put in production i think the new one's lessons to take home
from this aphorism is aphorism sorry uh is this the hacker should be aware that their code may be
put into production at any time so that they can make the right balance of decisions on what
quality it should be when presenting yes very true so long as you're aware that it can happen
then you know you might hold off the presentation for another week or two just to get it right
you know or make sure that the piece that you're that's not quite ready isn't actually ready at that
so yeah not good advice very good advice yeah yeah yeah i i sort of heard this and thought
i'm so glad i don't work in that environment i um when i joined my my last job
18 1981 i was the manager of the entire university's mainframe and also chief hacker so i just
did what i was appropriate nobody knew what the hell i was doing they just trusted me to do it but
that was that was just such that was so different from the world now it's probably a bit unrealistic
even then but you know i could do i could cope with modern world no i think today it's exactly the same
they i got advice from one of the they from a chap who i want to mention who he is because
it'll become obvious who he is uh yeah just write it and then it'll be used okay fair enough
yeah yeah yeah if you spend if you spend hours and hours debating it the architects and engineers
and everything but if you write and install it then it's there that's it it becomes legacy code
anyway the following day we had install open bsd from linux using grub who i didn't even know
this was possible which is absolutely excellent and uh it did a very good job as uh explaining
how to do it and this i marked in my uh absolutely know how to do this because it will save you
about that time when you can't boot from anything else yeah yeah i was surprised it was even possible
to be honest uh i don't have a need for it but as you say it's it's very good to know that it's
possible and sigflop came in with open bsd nice to see other people running bsd feel free to do bsd
shows folks keep doing them we have never rejected the show yes dev dedicated to all the people
who say linux instead of GNU linux and there were quite a lot of comments on that so um again
same thing again uh the language and between the intro and the outro you can say what you like
selan is us flagged explicit uh selan is of interest to hackers and it's not spam that is the thing
um but also remember remember the whole point of hpr is sharing knowledge if you're just coming on
to ruffle people's feathers then there's a lot of point in your show all right next day data privacy
farlands are bust conversation in response to common summer last episode about google it
and uh bill did another show uh about uh google which also had quite a lot of uh irritated people
actually uh there must be something in the water this month day do you want to read the comment
yes yes yes sorry i'll just check in my not say that bsd was uh but other people have come
into uh about uh about the show in passing on IRC and stuff so bsd says i have to disagree
hey there bill great episode i think you made some good points but i have to disagree with you
on a few things i don't want to spend too much time going into it but in general i don't agree
with the notion that just because the because you can't expect to have total privacy on the internet
and that so many companies asked for so much of your information that we as consumers should just
throw our hands up in mercy and say take it all we should be able to make informed decisions about
exactly what and with whom information is shared many people might subincluded don't necessarily
disagree with sharing some of this data but huge eulers and privacy agreements that google
like create make the transaction of information for services almost impossible to understand
also the closed source nature of their products do not allow users or experts the ability to
validate the claims made in the aforementioned agreements in summary i do not object to google or any
other company making the consumer product i just wish they were more forthcoming with their
business practices and therefore um selective on which services i choose to use it does make a
thought provoking conversations so thanks for that and i would say to that comment that i would
have been a better episode because he has a lot of logical fault in there and this is this is just
this i really have never liked the common system anyway because of the common system being so spammy
but i think we have 260 slots if he had taken the time to put that into a show it would have been
it's such a good comment we're wasting all these comments on the community news show day
if it's what i'm trying to say yes i do do do to understand what you mean yeah and i agree but
it's it's that thing where you want to i would guess anyway you want to respond and the
comment system is there and you can respond fairly soon almost immediately um whereas a show could
be anytime into the into the future i know that that's not the argument you would prefer i use
i do not disagree to people from doing shows but but you know you can understand why
why the the show's solution is not always the one that presents itself to people yes but this is
a great response to the show and it could be a great show in itself so i agree i'd love to hear
they hear the show yeah yeah especially a little expandable and i point out at the very last
episode remind me the last episode about the china thing which turned from a small comment
and i see into a fantastically detailed show that hopefully we'll start on many more but we'll
get on to that in a minute so folks trying to avoid using the comment system and record shows
instead especially when we're have a call for show episode up speaking of arc regular expressions
using arc stay tuned as be easy record some sexy regular expressions for you with the arc language
no i'm diverting for you i'm diverting for you i'm sorry but it wasn't very good show very
entertaining very caption captivating show yes it's easy does a great show i don't like this one very
much and they i did not know that those uh call on alpha non-call on things were a uh
puzzle standard which is why i see them all over the place yes yes indeed um there's yeah i
i like to actually put a list of them in here i think there's more but i don't honestly remember
it's a good problem one of the problems with all of this with the regular expression stuff is
there's so many of them every there's so many variant and it's really really confusing
you know to somebody coming new to regular expressions saying okay so i just do a backslash
blah and i get this yeah but only in this if you try and use it in some other system it doesn't work
etc it's it's it's a mess it really is a mess i wish yeah but posics have tried to smarten it up i
think but yeah but also square bracket call on s p a c e call on square or close square bracket
that is silver balls i mean i understand slash s or something whatever the the equivalent
slash w uh whatever it is is you know two two unverbos i don't know what the episode verbose is
but you know what i mean it's uh at least you get the concepts you can then adjust
i find it now a lot easier even though uh you know you go to a new program programming
language and you find out okay what the regular what's the regular expression here
this is kind of what it's like you know that there's got to be some sort of signal for start
character start of line and there's some sort of thing for end of line and there's some sort of
thing for one or more characters you know at least if you know it can be done it's it's like the
galaxy question allergy they both the spaceship because the newer could be done yes yes yes it
once you've got the principles then you can extrapolate from them i know but yeah it just bothers
my OCD or whatever it is that goes under my head i understand that it's not as i'm sorry i'd
go and lay down after i'll be fine chinton roy says lots of useful info great notes as well
very very true there are a few times when uh the plosive p's make it hard to listen to what
recording setup are you using explosive p's i guess no plosive is is correct word yeah is it
yeah yeah it's is what you get if you don't put a put a um thingy filter in front of your microphone
it's a called pop filter yeah and it's called explosive yeah it's it's a linguistic term i think
okay very well somebody else to record a show of this that's absolutely fine too you know
do you know i yeah that would be interesting do i read that before i'd heard the the show and
i was listening out for a minute i didn't hear it i think it might be a combination of my crappy
headphones that use on my uh sounds a clip and also the fact of my hearing is going
but i i didn't actually find it find it difficult to imagine clinton roy's got some very very good
audio setup i don't be just i don't know what mine sounds like anyway sorry yeah i'll do this one
shall i um please please yes and i keep distracting myself so read lots of useful info says be easy
yes i know i don't always use that plan tronics usb headset because of that reason
it does the best at reducing background noise i have to remember to position it correctly and do
some tests before recording yeah i i had a recording with my phone the other day and uh it also just
came out terrible so yeah sometimes what yeah i've done this i had a headset and that was all for
yeah gone again folks i'm gonna tell you you're not gonna like it content we will always always if
it's audible we will put it on the nutter if you have a problem with that you can fix it by
recording your own shows with perfect audio quality yep and again i will tell you that perfection
is the enemy of other perfection is the enemy of what of good the best best is the enemy the goodness
yeah exactly because uh i know that we have people who contribute and they're not that worried
about their audio and the people who are spending an awful lot of time on their audio produce a
lot less shows so um yeah at the end of the day if you want uh if you want your shows to be up here
on hpr it ain't a show unless it's on the server okay following day soldering a soldering fan practicing
soldering skills by hacking together a soldering extraction fan now i know Dave that you're listening
to this show going this guy just soldered two wires together and he thinks it's the best thing
that ever happened and it is it it absolutely is if you if you if you if you you knew to it and you
managed to achieve it wow it's a great feeling so that's a good thing to share i think it is because
it isn't that hard it isn't that scary once you do it it's the very little to it and once you do
the whole world of soldering becomes open to you in fact i had a spare soldering iron which i
thought i will bring that into work and just yesterday just yesterday folks one uh one on my
headphone the left the right headphone uh cop stopped working and i talked to myself hey hey can
you have screwdriver set unscrew that uh headphone took out my soldering iron and sure enough one
of the wires was loose took out my soldering iron hooked it up and work soldered the thing up
screwed it back together five minutes later perfect set of working headphones it's awesome take a
project like this that's really easy to do get yourself a cheap soldering iron and go for the broken
stuff suddenly becomes fixable again absolutely awesome thank you that's all i have to say on that
the ability to take stuff that is probably going to go to what would in some kind of context be
thrown in the bin and to to turn it into something useful is a brilliant skill and we should all
be doing it we should we should all the following day we had baking your bread to the season and
iskios is baking your bread Swedish style and i dislike this type of shortive why do i just like this
type of shortive uh concert makes you hungry and you don't get to taste is at the end that is
sort of annoying if there was just a way to like have that bread well i suppose you could make it
myself well that's it's always the way yes yes yeah it's a good one for the kids yeah so it's yeah
oh i love this episode it's brilliant i learned a lot from this um i make my own bread
i've done for yes i know many many years and i bought people silly with it the subject but
but i've never come across this combination of ingredients and methods so it is very very interesting
and i also want to try it he had me at porter i uh there i used to have porter bread in Ireland it's
lovely absolutely gorgeous lovely winter of bread yeah the use of uh bitter orange which is
several orange which used for marmalade uh is fascinating i would never have thought of that in the
context of bread and yeah nice and tangy i've had that yeah yeah yeah and the business of scolding the
rye was is interesting i'd love to know what's actually going on there when you when you
effectively boil the flour and then then put boiling water on anywhere and let it cool i don't know
what it does to the flour it must be doing some some strange magic there cool dark cooking shows great
stuff keep keep them come on all all messing aside this this this this precipitated a whole thread
of discussion you're well probably silliness is probably the best description on the on
new social yeah because it was it was flagged as explicit that this caused a certain amount of
amusement um you know and then there was a there was a tirade of um there was a pun storm
jokes about using using bread and baking related puns so yeah yeah well i'm the explicit stuff some
when the discussion goes on some horse like myself do not agree that they there should be any
explicit or thingy like cuz it just leads to problems like we're having at the minute and uh
on the other hand on the people don't agree with that and the community has decided to go
in between of those things and i respect that and um that's where we are i guess so this is why
some clean shows are flagged as explicit and there's no guarantee that the clean show marked as clean
will be marked will actually be clean i do try to because here's an important point it will get
released and i listened to the shows uh in the evening when i come home on the train so there's
going to be at least six hours before a show goes out and um now it's flagged explicit in the media
itself or clean in the media itself so by the time if the host has met a mistake and there are some
whatever in there that would make it not explicit and uh or make it go from clean to explicit then
it's going to take a long time to fix that and i would prefer not to fix it so that's that's another
reason so you're relying on the host saying that it's clean or not in every region of the world
it's just the nightmare and mess and yeah enough it's not about censorship it's about practicalities
just keep saying that to myself to shiba liberato 100 CT episode about the quirks of getting a
to shiba liberato uh open running for gaming and this was uh where he had a trouble
getting a windows 98 the original windows 98 to work and Steve comments about the windows 98
updates nice show retro computing is cool and uh the liberato sounds like an interesting piece
of harder as an aside do you or anyone else have a good repository of all the service packs and
updates were released for windows 98 and old windows flavors interesting so mirror shades who's
who's the host on this show uh don't we said um apologies no it's okay there were there are
actually a slew of updates and fixes windows 98 and 98 SE that have been released over the years
summer official and others are not blower a few links to maybe help you out also i'll provide a
link to win world which is a valuable resource for old os's that can be a paint find sometimes
and there's list of links here just hope that helps that looks very useful and steve replied it
does indeed help thanks for boasting these by the way uh i wanted to say about because you mentioned
in that show that uh yeah windows 98 you forget how big a pain it was to set it up but windows 98
as an administrator of an entire uh european operation but windows 98 computers was a lot
easier to set up than windows 3-1-1 with it's uh high mem.sys and all that jazz and auto-exact up
bats and trying to get a net where running and all there that was nightmare so windows 98 was a massive
improvement and overrun and not do it overrun windows n t was what we had yeah i was quite
scared about before or after that was before this was it yeah i was around the same time so the windows
n t did you know about the windows n t the legend of and windows n t was uh supposed to be an extension
of the vms fax so w v n yeah and yes yeah yeah because the quite a lot of digital employees went up
and worked for um microsoft if you look at the guts of windows there's there's there's a lot of
signatures of um deck software in there so yeah um so that was quite stable but the problem was
it uh was two rigid two rigid in the way it was more windows xp uh style and then yet a
lot of software that would only work on windows 98 because it's at 16 bit mode and all sorts of
stuff so we were trying to get everybody moved to uh empty boss the vast majority of software
and drivers and stuff but all still only work in compatibility mode on windows 98 so there you
uh those were the days indeed indeed anyway art appreciation sometimes an art appreciation but brine
and this is this is actually quite nice is this now the second in a series could it be a new series
have we opened a new vein Dave well we we should certainly be watching out for that to
pronounce to that question yes indeed i found this show fascinating i listened to it on my way
into work past graveyard and it tutored me up no end which is an excellent uh an excellent
thing to say about a show yeah i i'm very pleased to see more art relate things on an hb
because i don't have much of an artist or anything but it's just good to have a i have a broader
view of things in the world i think it's a good good vehicle for it is brine a potter did he say
something about making is he talking about him he himself making um ceramics of some sort
because his his his love is avatar is a is there other attractive looking uh surely not dev or he
would have submitted chills already going into excruciating detail of his passion here on hb
which of course will be of massive interest to hackers well i'd be i'd be i'd be i'd be waiting
i'll be waiting i'll be waiting for loads and like i actually would love to uh potter as well
with the kids um they have some mortar issues but they just love the concept pottery but it's
very difficult to find somebody who is who has the patience to teach somebody who has motoric
issues now i'm not saying there are lots of motoric issues but some motoric issues to make pottery
that was uh it's hard enough to find yes yes i can understand that but uh still
to love to do love to get shows on it absolutely yeah you know if i could if this is something
i could do in the house you know uh you know those get started cater or something but oh yeah
that's a thin veil to have them do more shows first oh i never realized oh there you go
oh great i'm so so subtle as a chance are they have a subtle as a chance of following day
Christopher M. Hart did you want to all comments you want to read the comments you go you go ahead
come do so this was spaceman who says i love no you're on you move forward you haven't done the
episode god you leave god you hello it's my fault i yeah yeah move to i was no comment i jump i
obviously hit the button when i said no problem so this uh next episode was working amateur radio
satellites a brief overview of how to work your first satellite and it was awesome oh my god
this is exactly why i want to be in hammer radio to do this with satellites did you know Dave that my
first job in the Netherlands was um a as a doing satellite ISP i was working a satellite in space
with a 20 meter dish Dave did you know that 100% dedicated to me i could use all i want while one
transpired on it it was absolutely awesome and i don't want to be i want to be able to do that for
these satellites this this was just i really listened to this show three times it's brilliant
yeah yeah well i'm really on satellite too i'm really on satellites what more do you want
why don't you press yes yes it was it was i found myself somewhat boggled i have to say because
there's a lot of information to absorb that absolutely all all the better for that of course but
yes it's amazing and this is exactly there was a few a few things in this where i was going okay i've
heard that topic before i heard that that abbreviation before what's it about why is it there oh by
the way all these codes the seven three codes anybody who wants to do shows and a hammer radio
all the codes the native alphabet abbreviations all the terminology used in hammer radio that will
be absolutely awesome anyway it's based on coveted actually if you want to do this let's see
and as you start it yeah uh spaceman says i love your kid mad respect for your son just thinking
about satellites i grew up with no intellectual interest in it for anything just playing world of
warcraft it's kind of sad thank you for all your documentation cool that's a nice comment yeah
and the following is spaceman had another show uh fucking botnets how did they work and this is the
this is the problem because if we do the text to speech then the fucking comes up before and now
we have this is an explicit show because i've used that word um which reduces the audience who's
listening to the community news you see this is where the problems arise guys when we go into this mess
okay uh anyway um yeah how to deal with it people put a void putting
bad words into the into the bad words again i don't like that are they explicit please
expletives thank you Dave putting expletives into the titles and the show notes that would be awesome
and just do whatever you want between the intro and outro that would be great but aside from that
i would have liked to have um more information on the on the on the actual mechanics of how to
uh how to do this because i would actually like him to do a GNU social how to set up a GNU
social instance and how to do botnets on the GNU social instance because this will be absolutely
perfect for a few applications that i have where you could post messages to a queue which is
essentially what we're talking about here so um spaceman if you want to do a few more
shows going into more detail i would be definitely interested in listening to them
well yeah it's an interesting subject it um i was confused the difference between a bot
which i had assumed or something which listened to a messaging channel and a botnet which
i assumed was something where which was you know related but was was out often to uh to attack or to
um to it's usually a term used in the context of viruses that uh that that are commanded from a
from a central glater like i see or something like that so there's obviously a relationship but
but you know it would have been good to have expanded more on what the difference between the botnabotnet
is and how you would write one and you know all of that good stuff yeah the botnet um i don't
think he was describing a botnet necessarily i mean he says botnet but i i think it was a bot
because there's one single bot going to one single thing which then is networked so it's a bot
anyway it's uh the bot and even a botnet would be a useful thing for legitimate purposes it's a
perfectly uh perfectly good topic which uh feel free to expand on expand on expanse or expand on
expound so the following day we had building some some board with an android app with uh app
inventor and droops walks us through her to build android apps with uh app inventor a block based
language similar to well this isn't this isn't the show but it's similar to actually if you've
ever used that so it's like dragon drop stuff very interesting and i particularly liked the fact
it was a fart board i can completely i can having kids myself at that age i can completely
understand how that would be fascinating absolutely yes yes knowing droops i do it does not
surprise me the least in the least that he has a wide selection of fart noises available to his
every command yeah indeed indeed it's uh it's the obvious thing to do i mean what what a what a
smartphone's for other than to make interesting fart noises and spissman says free software why do you
make software available on the prior prior to your platform because he did this hpr is not a free
software advocacy platform although it is quite a lot of people are using it for that but it's about
technology it is anything that is of interest to hackers just because we happen to do quite a lot
of stuff on free software platforms does not mean that we will exclude any content that is of interest
to hackers so fun with us as both droops feel free to reply yourself fun with oscilloscopes
taking a look at oscilloscope music by mirror shade i suspected i had heard that this was possible
but i spent the day watching these on my second monitor they are absolutely brilliant i quite
enjoyed the music actually i i follow uh what's his name tech moon um though i haven't watched
huge lot of his stuff yeah my son pointed him out and because we were talking about stuff like
wire recorders and and other old technology uh i simply had a tape recorder and i was younger
and used to use that a lot you know all the sort of splicing and making tape lists and stuff like that
and um we were talking about he said we should check this guy and he's got tons of fascinating
stuff with this this yeah and he did a really good um talk about you know what this is all about
and demonstrating it on his psiloscope we bought specifically for the purpose and yeah fantastic
and i actually like the way he fixed the tectonic uh tectonic but a little bit of that oscilloscope
although it's not it's a vector score actually yeah it's the difference which is kind of cool
i don't quite understand the um i'm not quite up to speed with but with the the difference
in that respect strongly suspect it would be a free software versus open source discussion
day if you got into it if vi versus emax yes so probably probably but uh yeah he um i've only used
to psiloscope to small amount usually with an electrode stuck into some animal the other
but oh thank you do it for that no i was i yeah i was a demonstrator and i was post-part
and that was we did quite a lot of anyway you probably don't want it no better actually do
a sure on that day for you let's see let's see what the commons are on that one
they probably don't do that sort of stuff anymore but yeah i mean i i was the one who caught
the cockroaches before they did nasty things to them but yeah they still do that i watched a
particularly disturbing episode or something the other day and i was thinking to myself
guys are is this ethical what you're doing my daughter doesn't seem to do
live stuff with live animals anymore um so but anyway uh yeah but what a fantastic show thank you
mirror shades for bringing this to our attention and absolutely cool yes all of these amazing
science it's many which i've followed and i do enjoy the music actually Jeremy
Benderson stuff is weird but wonderful yes and it's it and i'm not a big fan of techno i must have
met but it's uh the music does compliment the the drawings it's it's amazing stuff and you have
to see the quake and the psiloscope video as well is there is there is there no device that quake
plan it's it's quite astonishing but then it's similar techniques to
CRT monitors and stuff isn't it yeah exactly yeah i remember back to based as opposed to
rendering lines scanning yeah exactly so yeah yeah but but back in the very early days of
of workstations when monitors were round i remember going to computer science department in the
universe so i was at and sings and playing um space what you know that
means it was something that asteroids wanted yeah asteroids yeah yeah yeah and and that was
that was a vector thing it was it was being drawn drawn and read through the screen not by a scanner
but by a by vector so yeah so that's amazing that's just cool it's just cool and that's what we're all
so in my bill said ha ha well actually he said ha this seems like something right up my alley
have scopes will tinker also i will do a whole series of shows for Ken on components because he
seems very interested in them in my bill i love to do shows for Ken okay maybe that last bit wasn't
in there but it's obviously what you think yeah yeah exactly especially about capacitors
i will do a show for Ken on capacitors and my bill i hope in my bill is sitting in bed listening
to this you know and my bill do a show on capacitors what's a capacitor in my bill
yeah yeah absolutely we're all going to have super capacitors in our electric cars soon aren't we
so that would be good to know so the following day at league podcast with no swearing and then we put
in to the show notes which might cause a problem for say we put this up an archive done or go
whoever might cause us a little bit of a problem there we need to now check the terms and conditions
that all the shows don't get thrown off because of that so anyway i posted a show to say my
comments are as official and this is my official line this ongoing discussion shows me that some
of you are new to the community and are not often speed and montage players all about this
is absolute fun we're all busy so i've recorded a show 2195 where i read out the about page and
the stuff you need to know page so if you could all focus on recording shows that are of interest
tacker and mic ray points out nobody commented on your good or clean podcasts but the swearing resulted
in a tidal way of comment when was the last time you switch on the news and had to listen to the
news reader telling you everything that had not happened that day actually they they one of the
book bears again this is people new to hpr will not realize that there are very very often no
comments to shows which is not to say that people didn't enjoy them not to say that people didn't
get anything from them it's just they didn't comment on them and the first comment i ever got
from a show and i've mentioned this several times before so i take it i quite often say this stuff
and people knew to the podcast network have not heard it so i'll go over again so apologies to
everybody else who's heard so the first time that i got a comment on any of my shows i think was
two years into hpr and that was after two years of today with a techie and it was a comment from
somebody in japan about a ubuntu comment that i had made and it was going yeah but ubuntu
just as worth it yes dude because that was two years ago so you very rarely get comments on your
episodes which is exactly why we do the community news show to make sure that everybody knows that
people listen to their shows and they're good shows and just because you're not commenting does not
mean that people don't enjoy the shows anyway moving on back to my grace comments
censorship it is childish and i need to suggest that there should never be any censorship
would you expect a podcast about how best to kill the greatest number of innocent public going
about their legitimate business to be censored how about a podcast extolling the virtues of
sexual exploitation of minors since you mentioned animals and harming them seemingly in the name
of a carnivorous lifestyle how about a podcast about the best way to kill food without having to
bother about pain reproduction noise i would be just as likely to switch off a podcast in which every
other word was awesome as one in which every other word was fucking uh what was f asterisk
asterisk nothing you or i can do with linux is awesome black holes are awesome as our huge storms
supernovae sorical all of our suggestions the size of the universe etc but not linux that's
just noise like unsuscerate expeditives expeditives expletives the one we've been using i get that
into my head i'm sorry Dave i remember i remember the nixon tapes watergate it was all about
blah blah blah expletive deleted blah blah blah remember that nope that's how i remember it
actually deleted delete yeah okay today podcast was good and more to listen to congratulations so
Matthew Jones reply are also comments uh w2f doesn't matter how much this kid says uh
fuck the podcast was flags as explicit no actually it does it does matter uh because uh it's in the
description of the show notes and as a result we now have to check wherever we've distributed
to make sure that that doesn't violate their terms and uh conditions so yes it does actually
cause problems so saying it within the podcast is absolutely fine um but again i've said this
before and i'll say it again in fact if i may do you have comments Dave by the way i don't know i
keep going uh sorry did i not press press push to talk uh no i'm good i'm good
no i um i did comment to uh spaseman on fragdeb as i usually do to people um who
new hosts that come on i try to um if there's stuff that comes up i try to discuss with the people
directly but spaseman does not have an email address so the only way i can communicate with them
is unfortunately in public because fragdeb doesn't fragdeb syndication doesn't allow and there's
not a comment to on fragdeb we appreciate the service does not allow me to quietly communicate so
everything i say is in public when sometimes you can discuss things with people so i hadn't
intended this comment to be private but it has been made public so i'll just read it out okay far
be it for me to tell anybody what to do apart from my children of course i have no problem with
them using bad language but i don't think it's appropriate actually for me to read out this comment
without not reading everybody else's comments so what to do Dave bear all the comments are on
the episodes if you're into it to read them if not don't bother so we'll move on yeah
yeah it's um we were trying to make this fairly quick so yeah so much for that
be a good reason to to care to press on i think the lowdown and what's up in the Taiwan
street which i respond to i don't get the whole Taiwan us china thing and i did not and this
was this came through ira c and he said maybe i should record a show and i said absolutely yes
this is a fountain of knowledge i had no idea of any of these things uh had occurred
because of my very poor very irish related uh historical uh if it didn't affect Ireland
i don't know why i think about it um but all of these are interesting topics every link that
he's given could in fact be a uh show in itself and his pronunciation is absolutely awesome
he has worked in um far east i think but he's not based in hong kong so whether he speaks
mando and i don't know i'd love to know uh if if that's the case but he sees very very good and
knowledgeable as well and i thought it was a very fair um look at the facts perhaps there are people
who think it wasn't in which case record a show but uh yeah it was uh very interesting i love
this i'd like to know more about chinese history is on and uh it's a brilliant yeah absolutely
brilliant show and the notes are superlative exquisite with fantastic which is astonishing yes
which i was looking at on my phone and and uh trying to figure out the bits and pieces okay they're
all from uh the Wikipedia and whatever but brilliant brilliant and each of the links in itself this
would be a a wordly of episodes i haven't um followed the the links much but i will be doing so
i didn't know a little bit of this but but partly because uh my ex-wife was from the far east
is from the far east and it's put the past tense there but um so you know there's a
bit of discussion about china and chinese politics and so on and so forth but i did not know it in
this amount of detail um if you have seen the last emperor of china you can get a little bit of an
insight into some of this another way and i also um i never realized why Nixon going to
china was such a big thing and uh this this mix that's very clear yeah i didn't know that other
there's um certainly the the epithet nix are in china there's an opera or something is that
that was produced called nix and in china but um yeah i got a lot of strange and useless
information rattling in my head but uh this this concentrates things most most wonderfully um also i
like they uh did you know i don't think that's uh you know it was a military juncture on a military
about the rule of of Taiwan so yeah always good to have more information about stuff and history
i think will be an excellent addition to to to the show you bay network yes and and analyses
like this are enormously valuable um if you listen to um oh now i'm going to have a mental blank
the history there's a guide to this history stuff podcast it's name is gone from my brain at the
moment but uh yeah it's it's just amazing to have different views on history different analyses
of of historical things because that way you get to to start to fully understand these things
i was terrible at history as a kid but uh but i'm learning more as i get older yes excellent and the
reason we're recording the show today because tomorrow's show will be all you need to know about
uploading the show so how Dave are we going to review that one in the future if we say we never
listen to shows that are in the future well we get around that by me having done the show so i know
what i spoke about which was basically a rundown of all the policies and i've kind of alluded to quite a
few of them in this show already so basically uh as Bill and Ted says what does it be awesome do
it's be awesome did we do the comments on claques show but was i asleep when you did it not we didn't go for
it so claques says himself first repercussions question mark china seizes american service
submarine drone right in front of the ship controlling it people are speculating that this is a
first act of retaliation against the president elects indication that he will favor tyrantese
independent and it gives a link for this yeah i heard the vbc speculating um what uh china and
north korea would do when trump gets elected that you can expect some sort of signal to be sent
and i think this was a signal that was sent and i commented fantastic shows please do more of these
shows yes i agree with that so an hour and twenty one minutes Dave so much for a short show
yes i don't seem to be able to do that i'm afraid yeah i'm not finished the comments either
comments from last month uh mirror shade who was replying to home brewing sorry the comment is
from uh mirror shade and the show was a his show about home brewing and i'm thinking
of making the whole thing available but i want to do a new recording in audacity of the original
i still have the original tape but i need to get a new casserole player in order to play it
hopefully we'll get this done relatively soon and that was in response to um frank's question about
um uh it was about accents and stuff wasn't it um i think he had a um in the show he had a
the full recording of his uh his father was it and we asked him to record the whole lot and
and put it in yeah it was a relative anyway and uh it had to distinctive accent
yep yep so looking forward to that then managers should do that and mirror shade commented
on dark cults tabletop game by clad 2 saying that he loved this uh i was introduced to
RPGs in fifth grade when a friend brought this copy of adnd player's handbook to school with him
i actually discovered uh piliad's book system thank you
thank you Dave sometime later i'm really liked it although it seems not many others
cared about the system finding it bulky and cumbersome which i understand still it's one of my
favorites this game looks to be remarkably engrossing i'm going to have a try of it with my wife
thank you very much you can do the next one then so um have i got the right one this this is
see i have line so shut down sequence system d by clad 2 and it's by c prompt great explanation
right yeah yeah yeah yeah see i'm trying to be ahead of the game this time but then i
i got got what i did i messed it up i thought i'd messed it up and uh and and anyway great
explanation says c prompt great explanation of how system d worked with two services like this
i started working system d services went back to this show to get some info good stuff i just
wanted to point out that in the show notes there's a little bit of a typo and uh he explains that
under the fake halt service you have listed in the unit section etc etc however the
right below that you call the service fake dot service rather than fake vm dot service you say
it correct in the audio but the show notes have the typo so thanks we need to fix that Dave
yeah yeah yeah i saw this coming i haven't got ranta to doing it but uh i well we will we will soon
sort that out come in five on daily notes and to do lists with markdown by Norris by Norris
himself he uh there was a question about what does uh the two asterix slash md bit do
and it doesn't do anything special but all the files that have uh combined it to read me are
named by date and have the mds of xo2 asterix md matches 2012 uh as well as all the other daily files
the only reason for the two asterix to be there is in case there are some other directors i don't
want to include with the read me matt says of course thanks i wasn't thinking about the date starting with
to the cheers matt we may have covered some of these but let's do the manual we did do them we
did not record it not uh uh yeah yeah yeah so let's just do the manual as a as a as a course and if
we repeat them the next month we repeat the next month what's in my freezer by iskis uh he said
thanks do you want to do it sorry that's what i'm not good at this i need uh okay go line up the next one
Dave yeah i'll leave this one uh said thanks thanks for your kind comments sorry for the slower
reply the reporting device was zoom h2n as for the translation of the world these days i often find
without using Wikipedia for that i usually give explanations of concepts etc and that way one
can be a bit sure of what to say in the foreign language as english is a foreign language for me
obviously obviously i wouldn't use Wikipedia for translations are as a source in general i quite
often use Wikipedia as a source find out what it is um english and then click the dutch and then
find out what the translation is on the dutch side that's a good idea yes so the neck was
i'm losing the actual show so excuse me a second was this two on six five was the next one yeah
the comment on that yep okay so i'm not being totally idiotic good and this was
in julian said thanks a lot for this episode gave me some ideas what else i can do during long
trips i have a question about the lectures from uh kahn academy you've mentioned is there any
intended way to download these videos directly from kahn because at the moment i'm downloading
to my computer and move them manually on my phone i mean it works like this but it feels like an
unnecessary detour also i had to laugh when you said that some podcasts are like radio shows
because my favorite podcast chaos radio is an actual radio show they just put the show online
along with music news and weather forecast but i still understood what you meant with that comment
of yours and we then have a comment uh by uh dutch blitz tibleta game by steves saner and
nourished said uh great jo i was following a lot uh i was following along thinking how fun this game
sounded when you said how everyone plays the ones and that there was no turn i realized how much
fun this game could be the history of the game and the culture was nice to hear as well ex and show
steve also commented thanks for the comment indeed the fastest barely controlled chaos of the game
is its appeal you can dissolve into hilarity at any moment very nice nice when people commented
shows de morris had a show driving a blinked exclamation mark as an internet of things
device or actually introduce a thing device i think would be director that was that was the
joke i made yeah yeah so um right uh i'll do jack kulp and you can do yourself playing date well
is date well yeah okay see here's me because because we said last time we we would we would cover all
the things up to the point at which we were recording last the last show the last show was
recording on the third so i the the only things after the third was my comment where i
replied to my no that no there was my graze comment that was number five that one we hadn't yet
covered last time okay yeah micro says uh do you want to do that yeah okay micro says mq tt
and hardware monitoring hello david i can't say a lot in detail i'd asked him what he had in mind for
using mq tt i can't say a lot in detail but i've worked before on desktop client software which
monitors the telemetry served up by microcontrollers embedded in communication equipment is by the
french metro systems it all stems from an oval hall of cons equipment that happened after the
mon blonde tunnel fire highlighted that the system used by all three emotive services involved
could not communicate with each other the original protocol we developed was bespoke but since
the explosion in iot and other such things customers are now much more fussing about the protocols
in use and having the meat standards well a lot of folks are trying to stretch the point with
s n m p especially version three no since it supports encryption but in my opinion this is an
incorrect use of the protocol which is designed to exactly what it says on the tin managed networks
i agree it's lost horrible protocol every time i've avoided it as much as possible
since mq tt already has found use in railway systems and complies with sent elect
just the standard i think it's not we may be able to persuade customers to abandon them it's
use of s n m p and adopt mq tt so i replied to that saying thanks Mike interesting project
i don't know that mq tt provides a great deal of security itself there is all the indication
built in but the documentation seems to suggest that using tls or VPNs for the security
of messages yeah yeah i just thought it might be a little bit too lightweight in that regard but i
don't really know okay so we have the news on the mailing list new year's usual announcement of that
i also did changes to the site on the rss feed i've met several changes to the website so the
choice of explicitly is displayed more clearly this has been included updates to the text to
speech website and rss feeds so if you've noticed anything weird on the feeds please contact me
lost and brought sent like two um uh tattoo sent the announcement about Lorde's
eulogy so if you can please do that there was a lot of discussion about uh
spaceman and uh whether you know are there you know about the explicit flag and so forth so
if you're into it you can read all that stuff there um foster m 2017 i uh put out a request
for to reserve some slots nobody had a problem with that so i've reserved the slots
um michael has requested the announcement to do speaking clock at various different shows
and uh he's looking for people to do promos about eight seconds i've sent back a request because
yeah i think it's a brilliant idea it's at the kos computer lab uh k k k k
uh excuse me the annual kos communication conference in germany so he's looking for as many
people as possible to record a speaking clock so for example a it's just three hours three minutes
and thirty three seconds on and he's also saying you can add in stuff like uh the next time code
is brought to you by hacker public radio or at the next um it's twelve o'clock it's beer time
you know that's sort of thing so i have i read that if you uh have other languages other than
english or you want to do it in different accents please feel free to do so i think it's a brilliant
project and uh will be kind of cool to uh get the name of hgar out there so tomorrow of course is
the twenty four six hour show which will have happens by the time you hear this but you want to
hurt it on the feed anything else we need to mention do i don't think so i think we've covered
everything there okay i'm going to stop and go and have a chat with my wife before she goes to bed
all righty thanks Dave tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of hacker
uh public radio i'm very tired Dave i'm very tired
