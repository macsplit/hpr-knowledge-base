Hello and welcome to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
Today I am revisiting my Spambot Honeypot, partially responding to, well, partially responding to
RTSN's comment about how it did and any kind of stats.
So I did look and from when I first implemented on our public site on
February 16th of 2021, up until today, which is May 29th, 2021,
I have 661 messages submitted from the form.
Of those 527 were identified as Spam via the URL method and that left 134 being sent
through of the 134 that were sent.
38 are uncought spam and there were 96 valid messages.
So overall, I think it's doing a pretty good job of getting rid of the worst of it.
The 38 of the 96 is easier to deal with them and makes you less likely to just give up.
I was actually thinking of just shutting down the form.
I'm not sure how useful it is, but it does look like it is getting some valid use.
Keep it going.
Anyway, I also, as the title suggesting your own dog food, I know in my last show, I ask,
if there were any HBR listeners who used speech-to-text, screen readers, speech-to-text,
wrong direction, text-to-speech, the screen readers.
If they could give feedback, but I thought I should actually just try it out myself.
This will be typical usage from a visual user who does not very familiar with the screen
reader technology. I'm on the latest version of POPOS, which is basically a, you know, based
front-end. So I'll be using the default speech-to-text, text-to-speech.
So let me see if I can get that turned on and get to my forms.
So we can hear how they sound. If my method for hiding those extra fields works
as I was hoping it would. So let's see. We'll find settings and where was it? Accessibility.
To screen reader, turn it, turn screen reader on.
Screen reader on, screen reader on.
Okay, let's appears to be on. No. I need to get to my show and get to my site.
Let's see if I can get it to...
Well, now it's not.
What browser am I? I'm using Firefox. I am in private mode.
Oh, and I see if I turn on. I'm also got...
Why is it not? Maybe I need to close down fire.
Access your window.
Rodex, I will make a cube of overview panel.
Firebox, where's Rodex?
Within a firebox, private route.
Within a firebox, private route, in train.
Search with dot dot dot dot.
Okay, I get up early.
Except I was in private and I didn't save my...
You see if I can find my...
Oh, what's wrong?
Left over, back face, code.
LTE, left over, select J, D, R, B, here, V, R, D, K, back face, K, I, E, I, O, T, O, R, E, F, A, H, O,
Pre-H, R, R, T, Search with dot dot dot dot, go.
Or enter, but left hand in the middle top of my face.
The DPS, code, and slash, slash, dot dot.
Capture public radio dot or slash,
S, dot, B, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V
Here, V, here, V, here, V, here, V, I don't know.
I don't know if I didn't wait long enough, I entered my name and I had to hit tab twice
to get to the submit query, but it didn't say submit query.
I don't know if it was just too slow, so then I hit it and then that's when you heard it reload
and it does show.
So that works and it didn't give me the extra field that I noticed.
Let me try this again and see if maybe...
Oh, let's see if we can get something else.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now that's what happens if you just enter the form, let me see if I can...
So now I tab, it's not...
For some reason, if you tab to the...
Maybe this is just me not understanding how you use the...
The voice mode.
How do the entry form, like the field for putting your name, if I use the down arrow...
No, that takes me...
It's like it...
Okay.
I'm not sure...
Getting to that submit query is kind of hard from the...
I don't know.
Anyway, I mean, it does appear to work.
I'm not getting that other field, at least in Firefox.
So let me jump over to Chrome.
What?
What happened?
Chrome.
So it moves.
Okay.
There we go.
All right.
So it's red the whole thing.
Now I'm in the inner form to enter my name.
Except the...
Not...
The only end shows up in the entry form in Chrome.
I'm not...
It's not showing my character.
It's not showing my character.
I didn't have to have it, I got to submit.
For some reason, it didn't like ROAN or the ROA, but it left the N.
So I'm not quite sure about that.
I don't know if that's something I've done with the form.
Or me just not understanding how to use a screen reader.
I know there's navigation that gets associated with it.
I'm not quite sure what's going on there.
But the hidden URL field doesn't show up and I didn't, you know,
it didn't sound like you didn't hear it as I was tabbing through.
So that's good.
So overall, it seems to be working with the screen reader.
I think some of this is just me not really knowing what I'm doing with it.
Okay, so I do want to see what it's like on my work site.
So this is in Chromium.
So I'm already there.
There's a lot of completed mess in any of the questions.
And finally, we may receive a response within 20 minutes.
Okay.
So that's it.
Submit your questions below.
Questions and finally, we may receive a response within 20 minutes.
Or as for a distance, please call 1-800-Wish to be contacted by an icon within 20 minutes.
It seems to go sentence by sentence.
And it did put me into the first form for my name.
So let me do that.
Oh, a graphic top and leaving form.
Okay, it doesn't.
Okay, I can't type my name.
Okay, so it does.
I can't name my name.
I don't know what's going on.
I'm saying it's misspelled, but probably because I capitalized.
All right, let me.
One password menu available.
Press the power key to connect.
Okay, well, having doesn't do well.
I must not have.
It doesn't tell you what field you're in.
What do they call the attribute that.
But says in, you know, let's you say what the field is.
But I don't have it labeled.
So maybe this is not good for speech readers.
At least if you have.
I'm trying to.
Like I said, I don't know.
Maybe this is just.
Me not understanding how to use.
And how do I get out of the field?
I don't know.
So return takes me to the next one.
And it tells me the name of it as an email entry.
Okay.
See that you know.
Let's have.
I don't know.
Let's have to say subject.
All right, well.
I guess I got a little more work to do to actually make this accessible.
But let's.
The purpose of today's webinar.
I don't even know where I am anymore.
For today's podcast.
There we go.
I'm just going to see if that didn't form field.
This is actually it.
And I guess I'm going to have to maybe revisit this again when I figured out.
How to actually make this accessible.
Or at least more accessible.
The.
I just.
Sometimes it works.
I don't get it.
I come.
So weird.
When I first tab to it, it won't say like what it is, like phone entry.
But if I shift tab back to the previous field and shift tab forward to it, it does say it.
So I really don't know what's going on.
I guess I really need to look into this more.

There it is. For us, you suddenly, that was what I put down to let people know that you
shouldn't be using this if you're using links, sort of like a standard, you know, when you're
in a standard form and you're turning it in. But it doesn't seem to let you actually go
to the input. So, I'm not sure. So, the system issues that you can't actually put in there.
I'm going to go over to Firefox and see what we got there. This will come in.
Let me just try it. No, I'll do it in private.
Double-You-Go-Lens-3, Commodore.
It works with us. Go for it.

So, that's all on this page. So, can we really run you at A-Sash Canada?
One has 800 questions. And by leaving me with an email response, we did 24 visits.
Please completely contact it by a high comment.

I know that it's the message here, which is bad in both.
Okay.
Firefox seems to skip it.
I mean, if I use the tab key, this is problem.
It's not going to get to send.
If you use the update, that takes me back in the down.
It takes me directly to send.
So there's still room for improvement.
Obviously, there's a lot to know, but it does seem generally speaking.
At least the concept is solid for screen readers.
I obviously need to learn more about how they work.
And I guess, obviously, probably test this in windows on a windows screen reader also.
But at least I guess it's a step in the right direction.
Wasn't quite as simple as I was hoping.
But I guess there's always room for improvement.
All right.
