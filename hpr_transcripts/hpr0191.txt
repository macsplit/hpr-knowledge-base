[♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYS
So welcome to this way for the executive group, how are you doing?
Fine, fine, mind the production, that's great, that's great.
So, if you could do anything interesting to us today, how does your computer?
I thought about something really interesting about the TV or what it is useful.
You can take things that you've recorded, and one of the menu options is for your computer.
It's all I took, the opening of the elephant sand, maybe we have it for a couple of people who have worked and missed it.
Did you, did you, did you, did you, did you enhance it?
Did you load these rolls on the card too?
No, no, no.
But it actually puts on a phone, maybe you have a stick and you want it automatically.
And it actually puts it slowly puts on the TV.
So I said, you have to put it on the TV and follow it for like four hours on the TV.
And you just want to do everything, ask for a point CD, yes, like in the TV.
And it works.
So in my spare time I can get on the TV and watch it.
Sure, yes.
The burns are right on the box, I'm a mystery V box.
I don't look at a burn on it.
I'm going to put it on the TV.
What's our, the burn is so, I think I tried to out a TV player and work for a movie.
It's really frustrating that actually.
I think that I knew that it's a loving, what's going on with stuff.
Yeah, it's head off.
Yeah, I thought it'd be really useful when we were recording like,
we had our shows and we wanted to make a key to deal with it.
And because we've done so many systems right there too,
so you can slightly check through my washroom and call them.
So, how do you bring that to your computer?
Which one?
Well, still alive.
Long so alive.
And it's dead.
Close the camera on this one.
Yes.
So how do you want to build graphics?
I want to build graphics.
I want to build a whole school.
What's that?
What's happening?
Back paper.
Back paper.
I turned it over to you.
And after I was about to make a scene.
It's not an orange scene.
Yeah, it's an orange scene.
You just have a better look at this screen.
What does it do?
It just reboots over and over.
You can go for a while, it's kind of flicker.
And I looked at it and the passengers are all buckled up.
Whoa.
There you are.
There's a lady in an outsider near me.
Yes.
His little hand is good.
I'm going to go.
Yeah.
I'm trying to try that other way.
The other way is the power supply.
On the video card.
Oh, video card.
Yeah.
Oh, video card.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, you can't break it.
Of course.
You can't break it.
Of course.
Practice your soldering skills on it anyway.
You shut your machine off?
Usually I don't.
Yeah, because that's actually that's hard to run a video card.
Yeah.
Anything else.
Turning it on and off to somewhere.
I'm just assuming they were crap passengers.
Yeah.
Probably there was like a ground under something
and it just started to mess.
I'm sure a little bit that's like Chinese labor.
Yeah.
Some of those caps are new.
Only have like a $200 dollar light.
Yeah.
No.
I think that's weird.
Stop running.
Big feet.
That's how it should be.
Big feet.
What do you want to do?
Turn it around.
We'll just go over.
We can't slow down.
Oh, like this.
Put that back up.
But out of the time.
It's too late.
Oh, sorry.
I just kicked the arm down and saw our.
What do you do?
So you're going to do it.
I think it does.
The practice of normalizing it.
Did you?
Did you at least check the...
Yeah.
That was the case.
You should be right.
You should be right.
Probably you just stay.
It doesn't seem like probably the next round will happen.
Okay.
Maybe the title is probably the title.
It looks like there's some stuff right there.
And then I have to wait for you to know how it works to do it.
I don't know how it works.
I don't know how it works.
Well, I don't know.
How many flyers do flyers?
Two, three.
Well, I'd like to want better.
I think we have a flyer to it.
It's a scroll driving light.
So I'd like to have one, which goes out in front of the table.
Which people are walking they'll be able to see.
I'm going to access the color plotters if you need a banner.
A first step.
Okay.
There's a banner.
Got a couple HVs.
Got lots of them like that.
We have to open it about south for three a day.
Oh.
Should we all organize it here and open it?
Did I do something for fun?
Yeah.
Probably flyer.
There's a bunch of ones there, right?
Two of them?
Like twins over there.
Oh, it's a fence.
Oh, it's a fence?
Oh, it's a fence?
Yeah.
That's a fence.
Three all the time.
Yeah.
And then remember we have two weeks actually for advertising in a library.
So we shouldn't have so many people can actually take the fence.
So maybe we need that maybe too far.
There's a lot of CDs.
That's everyone around the country.
And that's what we do.
What is south for three a day?
Three a day.
Yeah.
And what is the addition for buying this out there?
And I think that there was more material.
It's not dry fully clear.
And there's a lot of stuff from there.
One, two, three.
I'm sorry I didn't get on the wall all of a sudden.
There you go.
I got a whole big apartment for all of me.
All of a sudden.
Okay.
It happens to be a cell phone.
Time is up.
Let's see what that is.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
Where is that?
It's in the middle of the sky.
Oh, it's in the middle of the sky.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
So how is the car here for you?
It's going.
It's going.
It's going.
One to drive a stick stick.
How are you going?
No, I can't walk.
how he is dibding stick for me now
is this your weirdy stick for me now?
how's it going?
okay its not stick for me now
what is his name?
it is停
well...
how was it going?
okay, its
its empty
rush to get wrong
tested in ambience
jumping gaff
jumping gaff
here
morocolerator
Accelerator and then use the clutch. Most people don't put enough on the accelerator and then feathered the clutch out
Oh, no, so you don't want to do that. You don't want to let the clutch out that fast
No, it's tough. It's tricky
Oh
That's not going to work out. It's still looking for the
Well, I don't remember
There's more
And I know that one guy was really bragging about it. Is there good?
Not this one
And the other one was key to rescue
I don't know
That's exactly what I'm used
I'm sorry
Whether or not
So you can put a tail right on it. You can put a tail on it.
Why do you want a detonary sign that they would give to offer a air?
Yeah
I don't know
So
I can see it
It's just a tentacle
So you send that piece
Sashore red that when you get this
And that's why it's a Sashore red that I've been used to
He was in a jail
I don't know that he
He doesn't happen
He's been here
Did you have a shipping calculator at all?
It seems like shopping carts are pretty easy to do just with a paypal
You know, paypal by now if you don't want to pay for the credit cards
But then figuring out the shipping
I can't find any good way to do that
Like paypal's shipping calculator is really cool
I love what you say
This is a good deal
You have just big shipping and this thing
Yeah, that's what I ended up doing
But we got some of these plots and stuff from Canada
And I had just pretty much eaten the difference
What do you do?
A lot of times they say, well Canada is in Canada so bad
But we actually shipping is a bad deal
So it's going to be good for a fact
Sometimes there's more junk like that
Yeah
They want to be able to do it
So it's going to be better not to try to fly something
Yeah
Yeah
That's cool
I love how it makes sense to fly
How about you?
I don't really know if it was hard to fly
I got to be right there
Since you didn't know how well I went there
So I'm trying to do it again
So I'm going to help you
Okay, I'm going to help you
Okay
So Suci just like you
No, you're on the...
You're on Canada growing up
I can't decide I can't just fly and I'm going to go
Is there the problem?
It sounds like standard
Yes to me
Yes to us
Last time you asked the problem
Yes, the text got a lot to see
I hope that you liked it
But this is for you to like your new hardware
For all of us
You need to stream and try all of this
Let's see if I can do it
Yeah
I'm going to throw it about that
Increase the goodness
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
That's why you're excited
You know I'm throwing it
It's a good thing
I'm going to crush it
It's a good thing
Right, I'll...
It's a good thing
It's a good thing
Yeah, it's a good thing
It's an idea
Do you want to see what you want to see that afternoon?
I don't know.
That's a funny stuff.
But I think this is a funny stuff.
There it is.
Is that it?
Yes, that's it.
What else to do?
Is that the X-keyboard?
Do you have anything else?
Yeah.
Where's the receipt for it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I was preparing it on the wooden vehicle.
That's the price stuff.
I got a permit for it.
I'm sorry.
I'll go shopping.
Where are the two beasts?
Are you doing this by...
Are you getting all the extracts or the surfers?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is there any local supplies around here?
So you basically have to order them.
No, no, no, no, no more.
I have to do anything to fix the case.
This is going to be really good.
40 grounds may have some stuff.
Yeah.
Small.
Yeah.
And it was a liquor store, too,
that had some brewing stuff, too.
Like the one on Wood Street.
I never went there, but somebody told me there was a liquor store in town that had some
minimal amount of brewing equipment.
Yeah.
I know only about coffee grounds.
But they don't have all the stuff.
They don't.
Nobody around here has any grains.
Go to any office.
The Midwest supply.
They've got anything really.
It's just terrific.
I go to Barron.
It's a wristband house.
And there it is.
There's a guy that's sitting up there, he's at the man's notice.
He's walking and, you know, you can actually get working.
Yeah, that's close to him.
How far is Barron?
About sixty miles.
Sixty miles.
And it isn't big on the nowhere.
I've been thinking about actually,
just that's why they call me for mentor, not a call me for mentor,
but just a food grid plastic.
All you really need to do is kind of hold for the airlock and seal it.
And...
Well, people, they do it in a...
Well, you can do it in a six gallon bottle back bucket.
For a lot of people, they do it in the glass.
Basically, it's cardboard.
It's a festival.
It's like your water bottle.
300 grams of plastic is free.
It's free.
I can just go get a big bucket from somewhere,
because I don't like garbage.
Oh, I was...
Carboys work, yeah.
Carboys are called?
Carboys, yeah.
They have lots of plastic bottles, they call them better bottles.
But usually...
Bakery's are good places to get five and six gallon buckets from,
because they get like egg yolks and things like that and five gallon containers.
They're throwing more of them away than they know what to do with,
so if you want to do it on a cheap, go buy a bakery and see if, you know,
they'll part with a few of their buckets.
They usually arrive on the line.
I know.
I know.
I know.
You can do that too, sure.
I know everything here is those big buckets,
but the sealable ones.
So, they've got an air pipe.
So, as far as we go, it's still working there.
So, that's all I was doing.
Well, I tried to set up the report,
and we are going to be reporting.
So, hopefully we are reporting today,
because somebody's computer doesn't work.
And somebody's buying a computer.
I'm just blanking.
I'm just trying to, you know,
to buy a computer,
and you'll be doing what you're doing.
That's right.
I'm going to turn it on.
All of you, okay?
Any surgeries?
No.
We didn't go this year.
Yes, we're here this year.
Oh, right.
We're all...
Right.
You're trying to plant chiptiles,
because that's 10 minutes old?
Is it a mill?
You can plant them.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Is there something else?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't plant them.
They're given through business.
Yeah, they're schooled and get the computers we wanted, so we'll give them a way to the school and send them for the next year.
And I've been setting up squirrel mail with a new Ubuntu and a phone.
When we cut the power to it, it wouldn't always come back up when you put the power back on.
It's supposed to run unattended with no screen, no keyboard, so you know, it's got to come back up by itself and up.
And it turns out that you have to add this line to the...
It's one of the growth, or you know, that boot menu that comes up has a line.
And I had to add the word IRQ pole at the end of the kernel line.
And then it comes up just fine every time.
So that was a little bit.
And then squirrel mail seems to be...
At first it seemed like blazingly fast, not going well.
The machine is really great. But then I sorted one of the columns, you know, about the emailing and it took forever and I had that on.
And this is hardly any better than the old machine.
So then I googled...
Because I've been trying to speed up squirrel mail for a year, probably, that's why I ended up getting a new computer and not.
When I put in squirrel mail, slow sort.
The first Google thing that came up was the answer to the problem.
I said, there's a lot of clean squirrel mail where you can tell squirrel mail to let the mail server sort the mail.
Don't do it itself, you know.
So then instead of the script doing all the sorting, it just requests a sort of list from the mail server.
And it's just like that.
But I made that change on the old one too.
And all the old ones are fast, nobody can tell the difference.
That's a good thing.
Yeah, they don't think it's the new machine.
So you can't take that.
Yeah.
And I also had to learn how to use R-Sync in order to R-Sync together in the mail directory so that they were up to date.
It was dog diversity.
Yeah.
It took me a lot of the figure out how to go across the network with that, but there's a lot of good examples on the web.
And it was funny because I learned about Searching with Google because I've been looking for probably a year on an offer to be enough squirrel mail.
And I thought I read everything that Google could find on it.
But all you got to is just change one search term.
All of a sudden there's a whole bunch of differences.
Oh, different replies.
Well, when you have searches, what are you going to do?
You can let me know.
So let's say you have Searching on it.
Oh, player.
And that's all right.
That's mine.
So you can be sure you didn't mean old player.
Yeah.
So you had to do this.
And you want any search results to put them up.
Right, right, right.
So what do you do?
You got two double brackets.
Yeah.
Or I'll say you have old players.
Let's say Linux.
And you want to see only what is your Linux.
You would say plus Linux.
Yeah.
If you say, I don't want to see anything, but it's Linux.
So you can actually make it a little more specific.
Why don't you try this to put your search.
And then you've all heard about Linux.
Right.
You can take out words that are listed in the top of the links.
Then you don't have to wait for your search.
Yeah.
So you're not going to want to go up anymore.
Yeah.
So you're limiting.
Yeah.
You start off with everything.
And you just eliminate the stuff that you're going to want.
It's a lot of stuff.
It's a lot of stuff.
It's a lot of stuff.
But that's a second time, though, that I looked for something for nearly a year on and off.
And then finally found it.
And once I got the right search terms and found it in Google.
Then I can find it anytime I want.
But the other one was about an ethernet card problem with Windows computers.
You know, it makes little networking.
And I looked all out of it.
And then I find it to Google.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are other search endows that do just with good job.
Yeah.
Well, there's some very good things.
I'm going to ask you sometimes.
Yeah.
Who is actually right, right?
I just heard of a new one.
Will we tell you what a search engine wants to be?
Yeah.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Anybody try this?
It was big news.
And it's not big news.
Yeah.
It's done.
There was something that they were displaying wrong images.
Certainly.
And six or three.
Four.
Four.
Oh, when we are here.
I'm researching on a new tool.
A log of research.
A log of research.
And I got some interesting results.
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know what?
This one, this is the way it is.
I think I was the old one.
He's on there.
So, so just a dumpster.
Yeah.
That gives a new dimension to free software.
Is this for sure a bugger?
Okay.
That's fun.
Search engine.
That was a no you know.
Cool.
Cool.
So cool is, it's toast, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
It's not happening online here right now.
It's already a platform.
No, it's available.
C-Y-L.
Use Google and search cool.
You want to find it out?
I'm sure.
I have cool.
Cool.
Yeah.
Mine's not coming up for sale.
They changed their link.
I don't know.
This is, oh my, my network's telling us why.
Never mind.
This is two weeks ago.
What did that happen about?
And this is, this is the Jewish network now.
The Jewish network.
The Jewish network.
The Jewish network.
The Jewish network.
Yeah.
So what it is.
I think this is.
So, a way that they have the best search engine.
But if I would be running by search engine,
I would be saying I have the best one too.
It's a different way.
And also, it's more this way as something.
Yeah, I like the little.
You can get a lot of information.
I like that there's a little more text from the page.
Yeah.
But it's almost not enough information.
It'd be too long to search for you.
This search actually failed.
Because before I was searching, I found our website.
And right now I do.
So, I'm not going to use this.
Isn't that right there?
Oh, but it's a search engine.
Right.
And I didn't reach it.
It's a search engine.
Okay.
What's that mine?
Yeah.
So, it's those history.
It's gone.
It's gone.
Awesome.
Okay.
Oh, you guys.
Oh, we had a very musical week this week.
Yeah.
We, there's a program called Keykit,
which is kind of a graphical way to write music.
And it's mostly used.
It's a keyboard way to write, produce music and algorithms to make music.
The interest to me was it will not in Linux.
Linux MIDI drivers are not good enough for it to play an internal synth.
So, it only worked with an external MIDI device.
I'm not sure why that is.
But the thing that was interesting to me is that I ran across the way to get the unos
and the 2x2 MIDI support, you know, the M audio, things to work.
The problem with this, there's some deal where it has to load firmware.
And there's no e-prong on the device, you know, from the 2x4 up.
It has a prom that has the firmware on it.
But there's a way to do that.
I haven't tried it yet, but I don't want to use my other 2x2 to do it.
So, I bought a new one all when it comes.
I'll let you know whether these instructions work.
The only problem building it is you got to load the Athena widgets.
You know, the program uses those WX Athena widgets, so you have to load the libraries for that.
And then the other usable thing was we all probably had some naughty things that we did in our past that we hate to admit to.
But there's a Windows program called Buzz.
It's a modular tracker synth and BuzzZa, which is a newer window clone of that.
Well, there's actually, turns out, a Linux version of this tracker modular synth called Aldrin,
which I thought was very clever, because why would they call it Aldrin when it's a kind of a clone of Buzz?
Well, of course, maybe you children don't remember, but there's Buzz Aldrin who went to the moon.
And it builds very easily.
You got to put numpy and the C, I think it's called, it's the Python C types that allow Python scripts to talk to or to use C code.
Those are the two other extra things you have.
None of those come with what we're going to.
I mean, there's things you just have to go get.
But the only extra things you'd have to put in to build that are the Python C types and what's called numpy,
which is apparently Python routines that handle some number crunching.
And then it builds very easily.
And the stuff, other stuff you need, which is called, it's a library called,
double ZUB, live ZZUB.
But that comes with the source for the program, with Aldrin.
And if you don't know what a modular tracker is,
it's a graphical thing where you pull different devices into the window and hook them up the way you want to,
who can modify wave files.
It's a new thing.
It's a nice music.
What software are you trying to use that didn't work with that first?
Oh, any of them.
I mean, you know, like QSynth or it won't work with Keykit.
The guy who writes it, he's the guy who programs for the AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey.
He's been doing this for a long time.
He's some big guy with stochastic music and all,
and that's what this program is best.
But then he basically says, you know,
this will not work with an internal synth.
And I've never tried quite a few.
I've never gotten it to work.
Well, it complains about the Linux MIDI drivers.
There's something about the MIDI drivers that don't handle all the stuff that this program.
And if you try to do it, you'll usually get a message that says that all the MIDI information was not sent.
There's like a SysX.
Messages or whatever.
Yeah, I don't know enough about the internal workings of it.
I mean, I'm hoping I'll fool around with it enough to know more about that.
But, you know, he just insists on having a breakout box.
The bigger ones work.
You know, anything over with it, bigger than the two by four,
the USB drivers will load, you know, the firmware and use it.
But there apparently is a way where there's a way that somehow with the smaller ones,
like the Uno and the two by two,
that you can use this FX loader.
That comes with, that is on the Ubuntu list.
And there's one way to do it with that.
And then there's another way where you can rewrite the UDEV instructions,
so it'll know how to load the firmware.
And I've got instructions for both ways to do that.
I'm going to try them out.
I'll let you know how they work.
Use those FX load commands to load with the sound base.
I have a sound card that's got the MIDI synthesizer built right on.
Use that for load with the sound base.
I haven't done anything with the actual firmware.
I don't find it doesn't have any firmware.
It's straight to the hardware.
Well, apparently it's the file that comes with the installation software for Windows.
So what you have to do is start that installation on somebody's Windows machine.
Stop it and then pull this file that you need out of the temp file that it's created.
And then put that on your Linux box and use the FX loader to load it.
That will be a good job for wine.
Yeah, wine will probably do it.
Yeah, and also I'm driving for a pretty much the end of the wrapper.
Now let's do it with the full-speed firmware.
All right, I'll let you go and drive it.
So that's it.
That's a little more progress on the duck house.
Duck house.
It's already built.
Well, the frame is up.
It's a kit for a greenhouse.
We're reinforcing the frame because we don't trust Wisconsin snowloads on a particular kit.
Is it fun to be like a duck castle?
Yes, it's pretty elaborate.
We should get T-shirts that say ducks best friend or something like that.
Because we treat those ducks pretty good.
All right, one piece of specials.
All right, then you can pull the eggs then.
Well, we do like the eggs.
We do like the eggs.
The Indian runner ducks are better layers than many other.
And we often had the neighbors lying on the floor hiding,
or we came over to try to give them some more eggs.
So.
I have to say I don't met their houses.
I have a smile.
We have a listener right now.
Oh.
And he's.
He's.
Sort of the community degenerative with.
Oh, it's easy.
I was.
That makes a patient podcast.
So.
Well, I don't know how to do this.
I don't see stuff yet.
I've never.
Never managed to practice.
Maybe 80s.
You need to take the day off.
I might have to.
I might have to.
And just to do that.
I've heard you could pick up girls that way too.
So I don't know.
Maybe you could try.
I might be early on.
I might be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
I'd be early on.
So what does he want?
He's asking a question.
He's asking a question.
He just wants it out first.
He wants the, he wants the, where he's ripple genes prince
basement.
Good.
That's going to be a question of mine how do you你好 girls.
Yeah, well, that's not, you know, throwing the eggs in this,
you didn't even want them on my style.
Sorry, oh, I see.
You got a safe shot.
It's fat.
How about you?
Yeah.
I've been working out a menu for our software scene and continuing working on these workstations here.
So I haven't gotten much done with the menu yet.
I just picked out a good looking CSS template.
I've been working a little bit and trying to figure out how we like things.
This is the template so far.
It's kind of dark.
No, I think it's very readable. That's very nice.
I love it more graphic.
It's a little more art.
Telling us what this website is.
A little more art.
They have actually icons with...
Yeah, no, I plan on doing that with the software.
This was just like about open source type.
And then there's a link to list of applications.
If you think there's something about these...
There needs to be more info.
Let's say one page, that means that you want to create two pages.
So you have a whole page and then you can actually go from one page to another.
And take a slow look.
Yeah, that's what I plan to do is to go through multiple pages.
And just to keep you on tip-to-toes,
we started talking about the software we are going to do.
And I broke it out into different groups, categories.
I guess from 2012, you could go through what you think.
A lot of things like that.
We probably should go and check the licenses all of these.
Yeah, that's what you're saying.
I was going to double check the licenses.
And I don't know, I'm trying to find some.
Just a little snippet of information for which site or something.
Package.
In that PDF file, what I was trying to ask me,
which is an outside of the freedom bay,
there are a lot of these programs.
There is actually this description.
Along with this description, somebody overwrote.
I'm fairly consumed away.
So let's say I go to the bottom.
I collect these guys out.
They're like an NSM.
I couldn't find a license.
And there's a pigeon.
Which is, I think, doing the same thing.
Yeah, I just wanted to include.
Well, we can fiddle a lot on the software.
I just wanted to include more options in case people would rather use something like that.
And that's my option.
I, you know, there are games.
So I found a few more games for, let's say I open this.
There's stuff for kids.
There's stuff for kids.
So I can save it.
We can find more programs like that instead of two of the same.
You know, it's not completely true because of that.
Self-packed class and the GVM is excellent.
Yeah, I thought that some of the stuff, like Dr. Python,
I had for Java integrated development environment,
if somebody's going to the library,
and they're going to pick up a CD of open-source software,
I figured that somebody that's using Eclipse or Dr. Python,
probably wouldn't be able to find that themselves.
I really wouldn't get any value to this.
And the other thing is that if we have a CD for things that people aren't going to understand,
I think it's going to scare away a lot more people than it's going to work to try it.
We want something that people are going to understand,
more games.
Yeah, more games.
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
So Dr. Python is gone too.
And then composer.
Maybe potty blocker.
Maybe keyboard.
Maybe keyboard.
Maybe keyboard.
Maybe keyboard.
Maybe keyboard.
Yeah, that's a lot more common.
You move to the keyboard.
For instance, you know, and I do it quite a bit else.
So these two go on?
Yeah.
I would say, yeah.
It's got for games.
Well, for kids with ducts, things.
Okay.
Okay, three times.
What is it?
It didn't put down on something.
Yeah, free.
Battle for Weston.
Pretty well, that's the open source game.
What's it called?
Battle for Weston.
So it's a space strategy.
Oh, yeah.
I'll find it.
West on the DPS and OTH.
That's my outside.
Oh, West.
West.
You guys are too big to answer my question.
I'm having a few questions.
That's like the boy.
Or at least the other one is the boy.
Right.
That.
Yeah.
Isn't there be web browser?
I mean, that's a...
That was on there.
You have a web browser.
Oh, okay.
Oh, we got blender.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
So open.
I can see right here.
Open office.
So here's what it is.
Email client, right?
Oops.
I'm sorry.
Then let me turn it over.
We have blogs.
People are hard to decline.
Fireflies, forebrothers,
U.S. blockcats.
Picture.
Let me know.
It's better.
Blockcats.
Picture.
It'll do job.
I'm excited about it.
It's just like juice fire.
Yeah.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
You know.
I'm here.
I don't have that.
Is it good?
Uh, but it is bald here.
It's bald.
Video content.
Yes.
It could be.
Yes.
There was one of my electronics things.
We were a little blurred on that blender.
Or that.
What we did created.
I guess we had our own families.
Yes.
I don't know.
Except if I was starting on a movie.
Okay.
Yeah.
Take a long time.
Yeah.
Let's take a long time.
Yes.
There are eight people for the teams.
Whatever it was today.
Grab it.
What was the name of it?
Big wrap it.
Big part money.
Yeah.
Big part money.
Give them eight months.
Eight people.
Eight months to do that.
What's that?
It's 15 minutes show.
Was it an animal?
Like computer animals?
Yeah.
There's a lot in there.
That's what I was saying.
They had actually done any breaker farm.
A lot.
About something like GTK pod.
So people will really appreciate the advantages of free software.
So they won't have their iPod controls.
Taking them to the online store all the time.
I don't know.
GTK pod.
Yeah.
I don't know.
GTK pod.
Oh, probably not.
There is.
Yeah.
There is.
Yeah.
There's an amateur windows.
No.
It's not.
I think they want that for it.
But it is not as well.
They do.
There is.
No, I thought I saw an amateur windows yet.
But I think we have to install some other crap and stuff.
So then we have.
Like a scheduling.
It's an IRC.
And I applied.
Do you have Thunderbird?
And there was an X-Chat.
It's an IRC line.
And then I could create it.
So.
Obacity.
Blender.
Do you have a better one?
No, I don't know.
So.
Be careful on your X-Chat.
So it's good and better.
Well, Pigeon, I don't think it's IRC.
You do IRC.
You're even.
You just do it.
There's a lot of people use Pigeon to IRC.
Okay, I used that out too long last night.
Thank you.
For those connected.
AOL.
Yes.
Yeah.
Your Pigeon car is doing well.
So no.
X-Chat.
Might as well.
Might as well load that one.
Yes, of course.
And I put it there.
I think it's on C-Mart.
I don't think it's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
It's on C-Mart.
So we have a somber.
What is it?
Yes.
Somber.
That's a player on music player.
Thanks, Jack.
So we have an LCD blender.
Again, pain.net.
Some people requested that.
H-State.
Zara, Zara.
So if we have a pain.net, we'll take this one.
Is there a fruit?
It is now a fruit.
It is a result of starts to increase.
So you do there?
It's really a two-serving stuff.
You already?
It doesn't have all those sources.
It says that's at my two license.
Um.
Yeah.
People from the market.
It's a lot of stuff like that.
We have to remember that it's all commercial.
It's all commercial.
Last time I saw it.
So it's all commercial.
Which one was it?
It's all commercial.
I don't know what came down there.
So we're trying to keep it clean.
I think that's the right way.
The question is, what are the other recommendations?
What I would like to get is,
I know.
favorite ones.
Pink State.
Scarulous.
Taxicar.
Then there was a rose dart.
There's a little part of it.
Yes, I guess.
Definitely a good book.
Celtics, it's new eyes on what it was about for
media production software.
I mean you can do story books.
You can take, like, reported with the rider knowns, stuff like that, QCAD, and the right
tracer go around, that's probably a bit of a bit of a wonder.
P-O-V-Racer?
No, it's a...
P-O-V-Racer built in.
Yeah.
P-O-V-Racer?
P-O-V-Racer?
P-O-V-Racer is not a very, you know, non-experienced user friend.
You have to be pretty sophisticated to script it.
It's great.
It really is, but you've got to know how to write the code.
Although there are some front-ends, there are some, you know, gooey design things.
And I can't think of the name of any of them right off the hand, but there's several, several fun-ends.
Yeah.
I mean, that certainly would not be something like that other stuff that was...
If you knew about that and were using it, you wouldn't be going...
The standard Windows user is just going to go right to wonder and start making problems with wonder and wonder.
Is this at all the gooey weight there for you?
I'm pretty sure a blender probably uses P-O-V-Racer, or...
You can't use that.
It's also radiosity.
Yeah, radiosity.
So I think that is...
I don't know what games.
We have feedback on them.
So, what else do you ask the boxer from?
Freeze, freeze.
Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
Freeze.
Freeze.
It's a clone of...
...the civilization form.
So that's the game.
Yes.
I'll show it through there.
I know, by sure, those games will never fit on CD like that.
Well, Sudoku, I mean, there's another basic, you know, windows kind of game.
Like, almost all those games are a tale game.
Yeah, you know, games?
Yeah.
But I don't know what must not be enough, but recall if you said it was a small and small fight.
Is it small?
I thought the media would be big.
I could do it.
What does it do?
I don't like here civilization or something.
Civilization?
Of course.
Simulator, Sim-Sim City, or?
Someone like Sim City?
Yes, I do.
Or you create a society and you go...
And you say, it doesn't matter?
Let's move on.
We can't!
Okay, so we have Q&A, we have PLC, Saunburn, things, utility, the backup, R, I cannot say that.
Yeah, Adam is trying that and he really likes it.
He's saying it's very similar like a single backup, but it is cross plot 4 and he can go what it does.
It creates like repositories and from any operatives you can go to any repository and you can go through the plot from up there.
And you can do full backup, incremental backup, or you can virtually increment the backups.
So he was quite excited about it.
Saunburn's it, I didn't know it was easy, but I know that I use Saunburn's it.
What is this?
Bootsy, what is Bootsy?
Probably just views, I guess.
Violet?
That's his name, so do we know what it is?
No, I think he was right.
I'm going to get from that on that website.
Yeah, I'm going to use it for legal purposes.
What is it?
Do we know key pass?
Yeah, key pass just keeps your passwords and you just log into it once.
It's like any of those Robo code pass keys or anything else.
I think it's useful, it's a useful utility.
Yeah, there's also a new cache and there's a Windows version with new cache now.
Yeah, you move.
Yeah.
Okay, we have two for space.
One with some, it's a lot, so Larry.
And the other one was, I cannot say that.
So that's the other.
I think it's open search license, but I would have been a final license there.
Here's your register.
See, if your register blows out, you can open this program and you can say,
Oh, what colors do I have?
Is this your, yeah, or register?
Resistors generally don't blow up.
They just, they know, really, they know.
Yeah, they know too.
I'm sure it's something I already have.
They can know.
There was one, I don't know what it was, I thought it was something called like K3D.
Yeah, I don't think there's a Windows version of it.
So see if you're learning, if you know that,
the way it will be coming.
VLC will play.
VLC will play.
Probably anybody who uses that register one.
I think it was very few.
It's pretty anyway.
You know?
Oh, be creative.
Yes.
Okay, this is a little circuit simulator.
So who is going to use it?
That is a little bit bad.
We'll probably use that.
Yeah.
And that is a resistor one.
It is.
You know, simulate circuit is slightly more possible.
Let me go.
Okay, but it was two.
Let me, it's like your first nice school program.
Let me tell you what I was growing up.
That was a year ago.
I was actually doing some electronics.
And I bought me a resistor.
And then it was staying on the spot to find out what was the bother with the resistor.
There's those stripes.
And then this program.
You just take the first and color change.
Now where do you take the third color?
Multiply by that is zero.
I can grow a lot in the program.
The next one is always gold.
Unless you got an expensive one.
Silver over.
That's your tower.
I don't understand how gold is worse than silver.
I don't understand how gold is worse than silver.
Gold is harder to see and the brown case.
And if somebody wants to want a Spanish,
you have that and I cannot pronounce it.
Does that one talk through your speakers?
No idea.
Just let me out.
All right.
I know what Spanish is.
It's a D.A.
And Taco.
How about Luna?
How about Luna?
It's a weird one.
Service.
Yeah.
You should learn service.
Luna.
One more.
Beer.
Service has beer.
And you never ask for one more beer.
You just say one more.
Luna.
You have to have that category.
So there's a composer.
You have to have that category.
You have to have that category.
You have to have that category.
So there's a composer.
So somebody is going to be
waiting for a few people improv pronto.
What does Xing Xing do?
What does Xing Xing do?
What is Xing Xing?
What does Xing Xing do?
What does Xing Xing do?
What does Xing Xing do?
What does Xing Xing do?
So wouldn't secure a file manager say more of what it does in terms of describing it?
You have to look beyond windows and you have a clinic server and the only way to get to it is to use this guy.
You have to get to your files. It's just like pulling it into a model that's going to be interesting.
Yeah, I get it, but I just don't think secure copies tells you what it does.
And you should say secure file manager or something like that, you know.
Guys, I guess. Thank you.
What kind of reaction is this kind of reaction?
Yeah, I mean, if you're going to try to get these people to see what this does,
I mean, I just think file manager to a window's person says a lot more about what it does.
Why don't we not have a prescription to promise you a blog outside and find out about that?
Sure, sure.
Probably want to end in all of the descriptions.
Possibly.
The same way I heard my audience midnight commander to go across the network, you know, for a while.
You know, like, because you can run that.
What was it? It can.
Yeah, I can.
But according to their help, I can, but that's as far as I could get with it.
It's possible.
You know keeps...
It's a year, and that, the current agency.
Okay.
This what the ass is supposed to say Buck began.
Blue Informer.
Storm same support.
Nobody said pork and whore in the Spanish forest that I came around in this picture.
What I read is that NG countries, I use, in fact NG countries, now we can do that.
NG countries, now we can do that. It's pretty good.
And with the games, we have 25 people who rent the city to sign out.
They're right here. That's very certain. Now we have more workers.
And we produce more workers.
We use it a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a
pound, a pound,
a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound,
a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound,
a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound,
a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound, a pound,
the big table, the information, and then on a Sunday free of date, we will be our
shiokas delivery, and we will have the flyers and handouts and we are planning to have a hundred
C's for this.
How do you talk to that guy at all?
Do you think he'd work with us because it's...
Did you?
Are you a talk to the guy?
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Are you?
Are you?
Okay.
You promised that last year, really?
I didn't promise anything except for that fly.
You got the fly?
Yes, I know that you had a way to go to your hotel for a few hours.
Right.
He's trying to annoy us enough that we'll chip in and buy a new video card or something.
Oh, how do you like that?
Do you?
Yeah, it's really a nice warm factor.
Well, this had been available at the time.
I like these better because you got function keys for one day.
Well, you really miss them if you don't have them.
The last big brand had 10.
Yeah, it's a brand new one.
Yeah, it's a brand new one.
It's got a nice keyboard.
Yeah, the keyboard is a long one.
That's a nice keyboard.
Very nice.
How's the battery life?
Oh, yeah.
Very nice.
Very nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's good.
It's good.
Oh, yeah.
It's good.
It's great.
It's great.
And wireless, I imagine.
Yeah.
Wireless.
Wireless.
Wireless.
Wireless.
Wireless.
No idea.
Cool.
I thought there'd be a lot more of that size of computers all by now.
You know, like for back to school kind of things.
But there's still $5,600 laptops.
We need to have Geralt listening.
See?
Would it be awesome?
It's amazing.
But nobody's actually checking IRC channel.
And I can't be reading into checking and checking.
Because it's got her connect plug.
Oh, still a toddler's there.
Yeah.
Look at that.
There we go.
Look at the gold there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's the open source being?
Oh, that would be cool.
That would be cool.
That would be cool.
Just click on it.
That would be a lot of work.
Sure.
You can highlight it.
Oh, you got those click on it.
It would just make it easy.
You know?
These are people I've just always said.
Oh, it's huge.
Oh, it's huge.
Jesus, wow.
Look at that.
Wow.
And with your key lessons.
It's got everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that tremulousness actually really good.
Oh, yeah.
Tremelessness.
I actually thought tremulousness was perfect.
Oh, it is.
Yes.
You actually get into it.
It's, you know, a TV strap.
That looks cool.
It's a lot better than the running around right.
It's shooting at people.
It is over there.
I don't know.
Have you tried it?
I don't know.
Have you tried it?
I don't know.
You've got to be in the middle of it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I've got bored with quake.
You've got to be straight.
So might like to see you face.
Boy, yeah.
You've got to be harsh as well.
Which one?
What do you guys say to your name?
I don't know.
I never say it.
When was your reason to live with you?
I don't know.
Somebody logged in there so he's still active.
All of them must have been that.
I'll tell you what it was.
No, it says right here.
Who's your info?
Who is it?
The purple is called...
No, the purple is called that means it's a pigeon.
And then here is actually your address.
Right, but on her E.C. it's the correct name.
It's the correct name here.
I think you can say that.
And if you have the same address that I have,
it means that we are coming from a single.
That's what it's...
It's my name, my name, my name.
When you first have the address C,
then you have something.
But I think you can change the address.
That's my name.
What it says is the right one here.
Yeah?
It can be the same name, right?
And now you can have that.
You can just close the chat.
Unless it can't be because you're both coming from the same name.
I don't know.
Yeah, I just don't know.
Unless you're...
Yes.
You could have...
In a server, you could type.
I don't know.
Oh well.
That's what the...
I don't know.
Then you can turn it off now again.
Logon.
Logon.
Remove.
You're all deleted.
And I can't.
Troll of backspace.
Backspace.
Restart.
We test.
Who is we test?
Testing again.
It's like...
Press.
Press.
Press.
I just want.
Test zero.
Test zero.
Test zero.
Test zero.
It's already been test.
This is the first second test.
No, the second one is...
It's actually the first one.
The first test zero.
No, the first test is just test.
That works.
You have to go on.
Oh, yeah.
It's you too.
Toss the chopsticks now.
Yeah.
Think you want people to just slice them.
Well, it's...
That would be her...
Her potato is...
Toss the chopsticks anyway.
Okay.
That works.
Test had two point zero.
There it works!
There you go.
Lean six.
So, we're going to have our other things here, Super Tux, Super Tuckers, Super Tuckers
Park.
I actually get to call it on.
So, I played in the street these two, you know, but well, there's a lot of traction
in the car.
So, Tux is good too.

be used on the web because it I'll stand with well and it's a good way to put
redirects and things like that in there.
So here just type the text you would just send it in that text folder.
So you can still have a link in the video or is that the down page in there?
No, the plain text email it wouldn't be a hot link anyway and you can put the URL there.
