Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another edition of Hacker Public Radio
Community News this time for January 2017. Hi Dave. I can, sorry, this is where I traditionally say
joining me tonight is Dave but my head is all over the shop so how about you? It's fine,
it's fine. There's another bloke here and it's me. Yes. For those new two HBR, HBR is a crowd
crowdsourcing podcast network that releases shows every weekday Monday through Friday and to give
everybody who is not on the mailing list and you should be a background into what's going on
on the mailing list and then the HBR community in general we put on this show once a month and it's
in, it's been moved around a bit this time due because of one thing and other which we'll no doubt
get to. Actually it's far stem is coming up this Saturday and we go down to that and well I'm
going down to that and as a result we're just too busy to to record a show on that Saturday so
we moved it to Wednesday and then you had some issues then as well. Yes, it looked like sand
completely failed on my my usual workstation so I'm running a full laptop today. It took me,
it took me all day to get ready. Yeah so I'll have that and thankfully I'm not sounding like a chipmunk
this month. I don't think. Now you sound good as far as I'm good soon anyway. For some reason
they got stuck at 44.1 kHz and when I went to 44.8 that fixed it but then when I plugged it in now
again this evening and went to 48 kHz or whatever it was I was sounding like Barry Manol over while
so. You were. Is this your zoom that you're using? Yeah that's the one. That's what I'm doing as well
yeah well that's what I'm doing as well and so I could sound like chipmunk too wow. Yeah
or normally it didn't do anything but it might be just something decided to get smart and intelligent.
I need to remember to bring my all my recording stuff as well. I have impact because it's
I need to go to get my stuff together and then go to work and then from work I'm taking the train
Belgium down to Brussels from there and going into the where they're setting up the stands and drop
off some of the posters and then hopefully I might be able to get some interviews because there's
something like 74 different tables this time. Wow yeah yeah and I know that there will be more
because they they media lounge and they open hardware section has always people who kind of
you know start demoing stuff on the day. Well good luck and yeah enough about I'm also
processing all the Hitzbj√∂rs shows the New Year's shows in the background so I will be hoping to
stop this from time to time to enter in passwords and the like. Anyway do you want to go ahead
and welcome our new host we have a few this month? Yes we have two new hosts and the first one
is Reg A who was on he was on the New Year's show quite a lot I think and proving this repressuring
people into doing chores actually works. Absolutely yeah yeah well done and well done Reg for
for Steppe Lurge and we also have Hannah of Terror of Sol which is the most wonderful
and absolutely awesome yes. But the the the commas I got I just had to change the layer of this
thing so that the it was quoted so that you didn't think there were three people there. Excellent
and so on being a geeks all about. Oh dude don't get me started. So the HBR 2251 is just downloaded
give me two seconds till I checked to make sure it's playing okay. Tronkade silence hopefully we'll
do what's the thing. Okay that one looks good I'll just process the next one hold on. Okay we're
back. Dave can you hear me? Yes yes yes it's as if we hadn't ever been away. Excellent yes I'm on
the last one now so I was telling you earlier on that the because it converts all they're uploaded
in August and because it converts it to PCM they go out to five our segment shows which blows up
the amount of free space we have on the VPS and as it only happens once a year then it's it's not
that big a deal but yeah anyway every year I could guess but to clean out stuff and then why
is there no outro on the end of this and then all right okay anyway so starting with the first
show let's go through the shows and we had it was HBR community news for December 2016 and we had
no comments on that and the following day we had why you should not say free software which is kind
of my tongue and cheek suggestion that we should treat the term free software as a bug. Well yes
yes English is a bug as a version in that respect isn't it although when I was going through this I
did I did thank you was tongue and cheek but the tongue and cheek Irish people have trouble saying
tree tongue and cheek and but actually it makes sense see I don't know why he picked free software is
if he had picked free dumb software then we wouldn't have had this problem yeah I know I know
it's yeah I guess we get used to the fact that there's so many meanings in English English is a very
very difficult language in many respects isn't it yeah it's a shame I mean
everybody knows that there's a difference between the word free and free you learn that in
in you know national school secondary school and somebody is educated as RMS and the like
definitely knew that there was two meanings of free yeah maybe he didn't appreciate that it would
be played upon or misunderstood it's like theory and theory it's a lot of the anti science people
attack science because it's only a theory but theory means something else in science so you know
it's another one of those words don't believe it for a second I think he was trying to be funny
you think yeah so many as a canoe software canoe is not unique it's hilarious what does it mean
canoe means canoe is not unique yeah yeah there are lots of those at that time
anyway but if you use that for at first I'll see if I can ask him I'll definitely be asking
the free software people so you've stored up a lot of a lot of comments so if you want to read the
first one or whatever yeah you sure yep I'll do my all my replies if you want yeah okay the first
one is from my zoomed space man spoke spoke wrong but like what about freedom is the question how do
you get the point of freedom matters across in that sense open source would be a bug because
seeing the code is not equal seeing the code is not equal to free software it's possible
to not be free even if you have access to the code people need to get educated and get to know
what is going on with the software I'm laughing because no matter what topic free software free energy
veganism nutrition the majority of people just want an iPhone that scratches their butts really
I've never come across one of that and watch their drones synchronizing channels but yeah keep in
mind that open source doesn't mean you're free so what word do you want to use I suggest free
lever or free with an explanation there isn't it still around it's probably because there aren't
a thousand ways to say freedom so then we have McNallyu saying life has language has a life of its
own you present a solid clear argument Ken thanks for the show my understanding is that if
is that they are a mess and code didn't fully appreciate the bug until people started using
the term free I it's a runtime bug and once it's entered common usage it's hard if not impossible
to alter the usage from a self I can live with the ambiguity my mind by minding context and saying
free and open source software when there's likely to be ambiguity and Brian says liberty
let me say freedom I believe we mean liberty I have no problem with Libra Libra is obviously
not quite sure why actually as it conveys the message without much misunderstanding I have a
problem with open source as much open source is still proprietary and I replied space man yes freedom
matters had they named it freedom software then there would have been no disambiguity and I refer
to the fact that he himself has used free software that he is referred to the fact that freedom
matters so had it been called freedom software there wouldn't be a problem McNallyu I don't believe
it was a runtime bug as it was loads of examples at the time of both paid and gratitude software
aside from levels of freedom the term free was also known to be the opposite of paid at the time
changing names has and this is changing names has been done many times in the past post-gress
inkscape word press Maria DB Libra office Jenkins it's all part and parcel of how free software works
armass himself puts the better name of opens well what I meant to say well open source as a reason
why open source was so popular and a brand I reported the bug I leave it up to you to submit a patch
because that really don't want to suggest other options there but I didn't go back and look
at bike magazines which are on narcov.org okay there were plenty of advertisements in there for
where you could buy tapes for money of free software and there was also places where you could buy
by applications that were proprietary so both were both were being shipped cratis as in zero cost
and both were being available for being paid so at the time it was well known and I also went
back and had a look like WordPress have a look at the busy calc word star word perfect lotus one
two three these were all applications that were around at the time so I cannot believe that the
concept of having to pay for software was not normal yeah yeah yeah I worked on a boroughs machine
many years ago and they did actually let you have the source code free I believe anyway
universities are odd places and sometimes you've got special special deal but we certainly had
access to the full operating system code to to hack around it and we did yeah exactly and it was
and rms even said in some of the speeches that yeah it was not on you know they
you've got the tapes and you paid for the tapes and you paid for transfer that was a different thing
that's why you know people he's never had an issue with people charging for
gonna do software yeah yeah anyway moving on moving on how awesome is
geeks geeks geeks that's the one thanks he did explain that it's French unfortunately should you
look geeks look geeks we and why it will take over the world yes exactly sorry brain
can you can you do this one because my brain is busy looking at the htbr conversion that's
gone over here I don't want to miss since the upgrade we're waiting to upgrade the the
ssh keys don't work so I need to paste in the password so that's why oh right oh so the distractors
I wasn't aware of this I am looking forward to the day when we get moved to this new server josh has
promised us yes indeed so yes there's quite a lot of comments on this one and geeks is a packaging
system as I understand it yep but it yeah it sounded very cool but yeah it's not too cool for me
I suspect anyway I think it's handy from the point of view of if you're doing docker containers
or stuff like that that you want to keep control over particular libraries and versions so it did
seem quite interesting to me but yeah I really feel I should look into it be more just to find out
more about it but and claque is very very keen about it he starts the comments with the with
the comment to himself saying correction 8 sink 0.3 and the show notes are already out of date apparently
Chris released that version two weeks ago and then Brian says please more preferably basic examples
of user package management I've installed it and really liked it but as a non-programmer I'm a
little horrible well into its system management fair enough Jonas says interesting it's interesting
to know that there's a virtual end thing type thing for an entire user login as well as a distro
I'll definitely have a look it would be great to hear how your co-host is getting along with using
geeks in his current setup a year later and claque said slides this is not entirely helpful without
it's from a presentation I met or maybe someone can lean some information about it and he's got
their thingy x episode idea there are at this we'll do as improperly on your show
well he probably will he's he's a way on Chinese in a year at the moment he's a he's out in
Hong Kong as far as I'm aware so he's probably quite busy good stuff good stuff so he also said
every every day package operations the most common operations I do are geeks environment
I won't read this whole thing where it's not that's a sure that's a sure right yeah it's a lot
that yeah just jump down to basically it's too much to um the next jump to the next comment you
mean yeah please yeah but I can't read this what is the last last bias opinion see my laptop screen
is tartaried working programmer like many programmers out there and stuck in the narrow focus of
my job I found this episode informative and inspiring big thumbs up he said cool what more can
you say from an episode John this truck is worth its weighting gold cope is replacing the throttle
precision sensor on his truck when the check engine light came on it turned out to be the
the throttle throttle positioning sensor and then my bill says when is the new truck eventually John
will do an episode when he repaces every last piece of this old truck that's a good comment I
like that yes still the same truck it's still the same truck yeah absolutely yeah and
somebody called Ken Fallon says no this truck is worth its weight in shows John replies just
getting started don't worry y'all I expect this truck will give me episode topics regularly for a
good while I'm going to guess start a motor and initial coil within the next year spark plugs at
least yeah yeah very good just paste it in the other show but that's that's actually why I don't
have a car div is just maintenance and while I didn't use it any episode one of the future of free
software series where it's an introduction to the series and he was trying to post it and then
never did so both the rest of the shows would be interesting to hear the remainder of the series
yes indeed yeah that was no I made to myself it's looking forward to the rest and then we had
Lorde's Memorons and yeah this this was this is a good show thanks to the two for putting this
together I was very moving I thought and an extremely well assembled and introduced by
Clarke too very very sad that a young fella like him died so young absolutely absolutely
droop says dragonblood dude it's hard to listen to this episode thinking about you being gone thank
you for being there for me and for everybody else too I wish I had been a better friend to you
I did laugh when they mentioned long-grabbling conversations I just hear you saying well droops
it was a great episode and it didn't do you enough justice you're a great guy and we are all
the lesser without you well said okay the following day makers on YouTube I'm trying to learn
to make various things watching YouTube to find information by Dave Morris Dave did you know
the whole concept to cause an effect the butterfly thing yeah yeah yeah this caused my nose to
Philip days yeah yeah yeah this is that's the YouTube effect I think or YouTube download or whatever
I have a script which I promise to do a show before on on you know just for fetching YouTube things
using like a bash pottery type thing that so I just put them into that and download
next morning all of a sudden a terabyte of dis space had disappeared
these are prolific people yeah I'm I'm glad to see so many women doing this
sort of hardware stuff absolutely not only like you know just hardcore real engineering going on
here yeah yeah yeah yeah because I was I was shown my kids on the couch and then you know there
there were various different people coming up so it was really nice to nice to see that
yeah absolutely yes my my daughter's also about both my son I'm a daughter a bit my daughter
and I were looking at some and she was visiting over Christmas and stuff so yeah yeah yeah it's
good to spread the word so there were a bunch of comments on this one Mira Shade says
awesome suggestions I love Jimmy de Resta and I've spent more than a few hours on his channel myself
looking forward to checking out some of the other channels you posted yeah and then Victor
all said thumbs up I think making things as healthy so what if factories make things better and
cheaper it's not about that it keeps it's about keeping your handyman as a handyman we don't have
to be so dependent on what's available we have options good point don't dummy although to be honest
none of quite a lot of those things you would never see coming out of a factory and the quality of
them being far higher by virtue of the fact they're manufactured yeah yeah some of them are a bit
dodgy but I mean some of the taking what's her face let me see here Laura Camp for example her stuff
is just art rolled up in her oh she's brilliant she's absolutely brilliant yeah she's she's since we
able to do anything she turns on to yeah yeah yeah she's a definitely a role model I said to my daughter
there somebody you should you should emulate her yeah she's she probably said shut up
hundred breath at least well I definitely I deliberately did not try to say that because I'm trying to
I'm and this is something I want to bring up on the interview with that's coming up shortly and
how not to overdo it you know what yeah yeah it's just nice subtly to be going all to be watching
somebody and then you know it gives subconsciously a message that yes it's not all men in this
feel that it is it is possible for somebody to be to be respected under just under engineering
capabilities oh absolutely absolutely yeah yeah it's my daughter and I have a have an interesting
relationship they sort of banter at one another she probably say the same to me at some point
dad you should watch this you might learn something oh yeah no harm so did you want to do that
why should I don't don't do me I think it is because it don't with the doubly on the end don't do me
I've never thought I thought I'd done me for the last ages I do apologize it takes a bit of reading
why why did you swan eggy so it's easy actually eggy swan he says is another I like and actually he's
very good so I don't watch him quite as much as the others but and he says I'm a bit of a dive in
all of us stalker and Paul Sellers de Resta primitive technology I like magic to me and he points
at some YouTube channels a YouTube channel yeah absolutely awesome I think this is a I need to go
through some of my series as well that's on my list as well of things to do I've already promised
that last year but yeah so he missed this last sentence already was watch most on this list but
there are about five haven't heard of can't wait to check them out he did you should we do the
the last comment because even though it's yeah for us put added today it's still probably worth
doing so Jim Weder says do you like to do what do you want to do no I'm actually processing the
sure when you hesitate I see what you're doing don't don't hold on don't let on no no no no no
no I said to take it oh gosh yes yes everything's fine anyway he says treat list I think you
meant great list but maybe not I don't know you definitely put some time in in being that you
were able to put a great list together I know when I was doing my search for great builders I could
learn from I made sure I watched many of their videos until I felt confident and comfortable
about turning to them for ideas and techniques thanks for turning me on to a couple of new names
I hadn't run into yet can't wait to watch some of these since I really agree with the rest of the
list so yeah this I always enjoy sharing lists I always enjoy other people sharing lists it's
you can learn a lot from from these these things podcasts and YouTube and stuff although since I've
started my list I've taken a few off because they've gotten bit by the bug when they start getting
more popular than they sometimes they deviate from their core values well yeah yeah it's the
sponsorship deals and all that stuff can water them down a bit as well but yeah I'm not
doesn't bother me so much as then you know you're putting up they're putting up videos every week
and start giving opinions on the US elections when you're thinking oh right for enough yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah just having a mad piece platform to be able to do these things I guess
yeah anyways just give me one second I want to check the audio yeah looks good
so oh yeah there was one thing about all the woodworking shows so it doesn't seem to be a hobby
that you can get into unless you've got this physical space in order to do it yeah I'm
thinking about them all in common and they all got a router they've all got a saw table they all
got a pedestal drill they've all got a vertical saw so right there that's a big shed from my point
of view even if you know well yeah I agree I agree but when I worked at Lancaster University I had
a flat and had quite a reasonable sized bedroom and half of that bedroom was my workshop and I
built some furniture in there quite successfully I had to watch about you know stepping at a bed
into a pile of shavings or the odd nail and the floor and stuff but but you know it and that
was all hand and stuff you know it was done with a brace and bit and a hand saw and stuff back
in my day yesterday down down joining is cool yeah yeah no no no I don't know I just I'm very
into electronics at the minute and it's a lot more compact that's yeah I'm very tempted to
to acquire some of the those large tools but I don't know I've only got a small
an ordinary one car garage so I'd have to sort of make the end of it adaptable somehow yeah
fold up whatever yeah but you're right you're right you want sort of a giant two car three car
garage with loads of room for tools ideally and lots lots of money although the money didn't seem
to be I think if you could go round and get you could you could you know get away with reasonably
cheap stuff if you're lucky give me two minutes I'll be back yeah okay all the HPR show all the
new your shows are posted and the feed validates and there's no weird XML okay you good I got that done
okay the following day we had not so smart how I'm fault troubling disk I owe issues
and this is an excellent show and will be absolutely boiled away for my um disk issues when they
yeah yeah yeah I um I've never had to do this but as you say it's it's good to know that somebody
somebody gives you pointers to to have to deal with these sorts of issues when you when
they do need to so yeah good for that yeah so the following day we had a maskan for 10 dots on
MG and this is an issue with the vulnerability scanner and destroying discovery times from eight hours
to one hour with mask and that was pretty impressive I must say yes yes yes again a little bit
outside my my sphere of existence but still good to know yeah it is especially with reading our
internal policies about running this sort of thing would be a career limiting inside your own
organization yes it's very you know it's very interesting to see somebody's daily daily job you know
that uh you need to check all these ports on uh if you're running hosting services to see what's
open and stuff so yeah yeah yeah absolutely good look into it so uh quick rumba tips and some silicon
packets now what was he doing putting silicon packets into a toaster oven do you have any idea
well um I made a note about this because I was thinking silicon what is he what is he does he mean
silicon you wrote silicon and these are sort of things I have to check so silicon's the element
silicon is SIO2 silicon dioxide and it's the naturally cooling mineralized in quartz sand etc
and silicon is an inert robbery polymer using kitchen implements etc that's quoting my notes um
and so I have to deal with this man every day well yeah something bend in my brain I'm sorry
but uh silica gel is what he's talking about silica gel is the little packets you get in stuff that
needs to be needs to be uh kept away from damp and he's talking about the fact that you can if you
heat them to a fairly low temperature uh after they have got damp you can dry them out again and make
them usable yeah that's what I thought you meant but then he was talking about putting them in when
you're cooking a turkey I forget what temperature is only about 110 or something Fahrenheit or
something I'm not sure I forget what the temperature is for yeah well I thought he was talking about
using them in the cooking process to keep to absorb the moisture of a turkey as you roasted
that that I didn't get probably because I was stuck on the silicon silicon it's just a curse of
curse of having a brain like man no friend so operator if you could do another show explain
in that that will be awesome thank you see what it did there see what it did there
yeah yeah now that I posted all the other shows I can focus on getting getting people to do more
shows podcasts I listened to by red J excellent list uh quite a few actually that I've never heard of
before and that have come up on other people's lists again and again I need to book an opiuml
file together yes I know it's on the list yeah as I said before people's lists are always
fascinating there's there's too many sports ones here for me but that's just my my prejudices but
now there's some there's some good stuff the few I if you're listening to I'm sure you do too
damn darling and people like that yeah cool no don't listen to downcarlin for the very reason that
when people are seeing how long they are I already have a podcast list that's going
cool well if I put another podcast in I know need to take a podcast out so that's that's
that's not good I yeah yeah I listen to podcasts all day long but I'm still at three gigs of
unlistened to so I need to be listening to two simultaneously I think Paul E.B says update on
Linux the diets probably recorded the podcast before the new sweet house which is true Linux
on dice which really was a great show ended in the new year but the two guys went on and started
late night Linux as follow up podcast so they are now over at lidnightlinics.com
since you put them on the list I'll give TLLTS another go I could really click and get it into
the first time I tried best wishes and thanks for all the content as far as TLLTS goals you need to
do tronkate silence yeah yeah I do I do I can shrink them quite considerably and speed them up
and everything and red j replies the Linux latex update info thanks Paul B I had not listened to
the last two LIDOTES podcast when I submitted my list thanks for the info yeah shame about LIDOTES
but there you go well they're don't plan yeah the new the new show sounds really good I like the
um i key dochety and uh fail him whittily as they do so the following day we had
neighborly greetings we covered the title podcast recommendations and well wishes NATO alphabet
so we got some podcast recommendations in there as well so that was that was kind of great
which was a cool thing to do I like that yeah I'm leaving it a while before I do the translations
and add them to the opium l file but I I will do that I have already
are you are you maintaining an opium l file for the hpr site then
but that's just you volunteering there well the last time I did a podcast listen took two shows
and there was an opium l list with it so don't don't don't get me started yeah yeah yeah so
windigo said what a cool spin on podcast recommendation topics I didn't think I could even
formally be introduced to the NATO alphabet and your recommended podcast sound intriguing as well
thanks and welcome to hpr Clinton Roy says thanks thanks very much for this it was wonderful
little episode I heard this on a plane with all the noise and surrounding all the noise surrounding
me it was interesting to really listen to it with my headphone noise cancellation off and work out
how good it was at carrying information when there's a lot of background noise
god dummy we called it five not five if I'm not mistaken the total five for five tree for tree
when I was in the army I heard that yeah yeah I've heard that both yeah yeah yeah yeah like the
nine are business just to make him more more clear but yeah tree is probably because of the
yeah I imagine where that came from there was yeah I can't I'm not actually a liberty to say
there's something quite amusing happened this month with that where was I kayak camping yes kayak
camping is really fun and an affordable way to explore outdoors and get away another episode from
Louisiana apparently and commons by this with by droops obviously who was kayak camping
mongo says camping the right way I just listened to your excellent podcast and kayak camping in
Louisiana and have arrived at the right way of doing you have arrived at the right way of doing it
and I enjoyed the story for me there is nothing better than walking up waking up in the
great outdoors I tend to camp for many years sometimes with backpack or bicycle but mostly from
the car and usually with dogs cheap gear mostly real food nor tech thank you for the podcast
and drip says thanks thanks for the kind comment mongo after listening to the podcast again I left
out something cheap gear is not the same as bad gear you want quality gear but not to pay pay much
for it if I had a four hundred dollar tent and an ember burn a hole in it I would be be much more
upset than when my forty dollar tent gets a hole I try and test everything in my yard before
relying on it tent under sprinkler as to not bring worthless gear with me good plan good plan yeah
yeah absolutely this kind of goes along with the more stuff you bring the worst of a time you have
gear will get dirty and tear and melt and get lost none of this stuff should be so precious
that it ruins your time have backups of important things fire starting water filtration navigation
and just roll with it hmm cool and I said another vacation destination he just invited us all to stay
which he did and droops replies vacation destination can you know you're always welcome though if
you overstay I might just leave you in the woods and come visit sometime and bring your battery so
you can keep running hp I like a champ excellent excellent and john cob says not a camper I'm not a camper
would you make it sound like it's almost something I might want to try some day very much very much
a case in point for me I definitely want to try kayaking around the waters here in Louisiana
but I'm not sure about camping about the camping bit by the way I never realized you were in
Lee Louisiana give me a holler if you ever come through left yet cool was he talking to me there as
well yes I think that's another invitation for my inevitable trip around the US yeah yeah yeah
I think he invited you long too yeah by chance I'll turn some penge in the garage there some time yeah
professor John cult there at the uni he said I could keep here for
oh yeah nice try yeah the guy with the broke down truck
caliber a little ebook server by John cult as I'll quick run down how to share your ebook library
using caliber server which actually has turned out to be something that I intend to do right now
well not right now fast and blah blah blah blah blah but I got bought an ebook reader
cobo touch two and yes I'm wondering if I like I'm still early days so I'm having a look at that
but this seemed to have stirred up a bit of interest yes it's yeah I found it quite intriguing I
didn't realize it had that capability it's a very cool feature absolutely and it's nice to be
you know to have a library in the house essentially just kind of cool yeah yeah yeah and
dad dummy who'd been very busy posting comments but not as busy posting shows Dave nice
good voice I've tried this and it works great I don't remember if you if it was noted in the show
but you need to supply the port number on my kin 3g kindle with a keyboard it's hard to read the
page had to play about with the display settings and reload the page when the page got garbled but it
did work I think I'll probably plug in the 3gs if possible though because it takes me a while to
get to the page work much better on the Kindle DX okay John cult replies ports whoops yes must
have must have port number appended to oh glad it worked and he just tried it this is again
dad dummy I just tried it from another GPS 3gs and it worked fine so I compared the two side by
side and noticed the display on one had a problem I didn't notice that while reading books with
that in mind I've changed my mind and we'll use this 3gs excluding the one use this for the 3gs
excluding the one with the display defect interesting yeah so cool stuff another thing for a Raspberry
Pi as by the by reflections on freedom of speech and this was by Murat Shades and Drupes says
well said very well said exclamation mark yes this was this was an excellent show it's really well
well reasoned I thought Bill Miller comments hello hey great podcasts and I agree with you
pretty much 100% I may not even agree with spaceman but I totally support his right to express his
opinion no matter how offensive it is to others hope to hear more from you absolutely but I don't
think anybody was that particularly offended by spaceman it was just the the forum the the location
where it happened I don't think they were expecting it you know yeah in that position but I think
we can we can pretty much refer people to episode 2210 is HBR's stance on freedom of speech
from now on this is the policy yeah it's a good one I mean so and as well it's well explained too
yeah absolutely cool I love it actually in that in mind I was I don't know if I should say I'm
lining up a an interview with a guy in work who's who works on what radio stations public access
radio stations in the UK and was interested to hear that we have content so I'm going to
probably do an interview with him first and then see if there are people on the network who want
to submit tech shows or stuff over there in which case this clean and thingy clean and explicit
becomes you know if you are putting shows over there then they would really need to be clean
and somebody would need to listen to them and say okay this is this is not going to find some
we bankrupt some public access radio stations because they put in naughty words and for your
hour shows oh yes the seven band words in the states and all that stuff yeah exactly if you're
a 22-11 my broadcast workflow how I'm done on managed listen to and delete podcasts or as I put
us how to over a kill oh my god damn did I not like reference to your overkill comment in here
yes I can completely understand how this happened but at some point at some point a refactoring
of cord is required well yeah that's what I said yeah but it is it's amazing how you can
it's a bit like that sort of woodwork thing again you've made a chair and then you've added a
sort of table on the side and then you've you've got to got to think the cover over the top of the
head and you know it just becomes ridiculous which this does but yeah it's got good ideas in there
I think good ideas for me but it's just overkill as you say you are right while the problem is
the problem lies with your SS specer being so loose and the atom spec being so strict that you need
to deal with all the all the intricacies that people have done in between either deliberately or
accidentally or one way or the other and then this you know it's it takes 10 minutes to write a
podcast client and it takes 10 years to maintain it yeah yeah yeah well that's really the point
I think Bash Potter was was brilliant and it's in its time it's just brilliant anyway but it
it was fine for its time but it's it's you know it doesn't have so many exceptions
yes it's because you know I sometimes think a different approach would be to go and say to people
okay here's your RSS feed is completely you know crap but then you know other we should be thankful
now that you know we should be thankful that people are still producing our SS feeds because
after the Google reader thing that they talk and all's dive yeah yeah I know I know I'm
I'm enough of a nerd to actually sometimes go and point out deficiencies in feeds to people
and I've had one or two reasonable replies and a few where they've told me to go and boil my
heed as they say yes yes yes meandering cyberbunk and the mini disk the cyberbunk history of the
Sony mini disk by kubnu and I found this because personally hated the whole concept of the mini
disk and it's a proprietary nature but I found this a very interesting show nonetheless yes yes
it was very it's quite timely for me my son had a mini disk and when he got fed up with it and
wanted to go on something better he left it with me and I was I found it in in a box of interesting
things the other day and I was thinking what can I still work is a portable mini disk plant
what can I do with this so yeah and I didn't really have an answer to fit I might do it it was very
interesting to listen to this as a consequence you know sometimes I think we're living in the matrix
when stuff like that happens you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah what are the odds yes
yeah great show listen to your show today and I brought back a lot of memories as well I went
through almost the same thing in the timeline of your tech lifetime there and reminded me that some
of the great and not great tech items we used to guess to and where we are now don't tell anymore
I still have some of these don't tell anyone I still have some of these mini disks wall
and kovmo to have an answer oh god butchers name that's why I don't remember my name on the
text to speech I think it's only it's only fair that text to speech gets to butcher my name
every show yes yes I should have listened to Adam and he was when he said he was did he say
he was maybe he didn't I don't know how he says anyway he says it's starting to become a bit of
disease picked up a rack mini disk deck of Craigslist still have not told the wife
yes I can I can understand why you would do that though yeah it's tempting tempting
Matt says mini disk brought me here mini disk is still gone strong and it was via the mini disk
face group group the Facebook group that I discovered this link as an online group they are
approaching nearly two thousand members and shows that there is still a subculture for the format
welcome aboard that's cool no no cool stuff yeah absolutely I didn't realize until I saw this
comment that there that it was still such an interest in the moment dig deep because it sounds
like a cool thing to be playing with oh it's only a matter of time before the hipsters come along
thank you mini disk is cool we we had a magneto optic drive thingy on some machines at work
and it was never all that good and the drivers for it were rubbish and it got taken off the machine
and put in in the storage cupboard I was really upset when I discovered that one of the senior
managers decided it would want to be thrown out it could have thrown it in migration out of
I'd have played with that for certain anyway following day clay body basic clay theory
this is in response to our request for Brian to do clay body shows thank you this was awesome this
is how you start a series absolutely absolutely yeah yeah yeah absolutely yes yes what a wonderful
response could yeah yeah that was just yeah yeah yeah and really well done to I've felt that he'd
maybe done that he'd explained this before to somebody but well if you have some I mean this is
again liquid gold I was I was thinking of this very show for you know brought as a sampler for
broadcasting and on radio stations the reason I was talking about because there were
syndicate shows among other people and we've often had times here where people have asked to syndicate
shows so it would be nice for us to syndicate out some you know the best of HBR to all these radio
stations 14 or 15 different countries around the world kind of nice yeah cool yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah this is this yeah this should be great continues on with this because that gave me a really
nice understanding of of basically the signs behind it was pretty cool yeah yeah yeah I made
links to myself to go and look into you know what is kale in night what is felled spa and and
all that sort of stuff have you got those because that would be no harm to kind of fluff out the
the old show notes there with a little bit more with a link to some of the stuff so if you have
your own show notes can you pop them in there I will I will do that yes yes I yeah I would have made
made links if it if it was me in these notes but then I'm you know I'm like with show notes but
yeah few more few more links would be would be good yeah I will see what I can do okay cool
the following day upgrading vehicle lights from halogen to led by john the man kulp
and steve says what about the blinkers which are indicators for the rest of us it was pretty funny
I was I was sitting there listening to the episode while you were changing the both bulbs I was
thinking of myself you know I bet the led bulb would mess up the timing and the turn signal signal
no blinkers and then you're at mandem and at the mend and Dave atendem thank you if I ever get
bladder working here are they the the the trigger word will be Dave I'm not sure what the
replies going to be yes next nicely done I was waiting for you to say that last bit um Clinton Roy
says so if you replace an inefficient bulb with a highly efficient led and a resistor of the same load
you're actually saving any power at all which is a good question I think yeah well the answer comes up
next probably not says john kulp now probably not saving power on the blinkers but if you get 10 times
more lifespan as they claim as they claim and brighter lights it's still worthwhile and he also replied
to steve saying while you're you're way ahead of me I didn't even consider that this could happen
to the blinkers until I actually happened and then I had to do research to figure out what was
going on I don't understand electricity very well but all on our second if if it's drawing less
current the the reason the resistor is there and somebody is going to be in my bill or whoever
is going to be your jezra is going to be thrown stuff at the microphone and can you have no concept
of electricity yes come on and explain it to me but if the reason for the the resistor there
is because it doesn't it doesn't have it's not drawing enough current so therefore the car
thinks that it is not the bulb is not there but the putting a small resistor there to give it a
slight amount of current will give it will tell the car that there is a resistor that there is a
light there but that doesn't necessarily need to be the full resistance of a light bulb I guess
I am going to imagine so yeah yeah but then again in this case even if you are burning the same
amount of power or using the same amount of power you're not necessarily you're not necessarily
could be converting that to light or heat on the bulb itself on the other hand you're driving
a fucking car guys go with public transport the the resistor is in a metal metal body
it has to be fixed quite quite firmly to a metal structure but yeah it's got a big
little heat sink on it so it's turning the the current into into heat yes but it will not
necessarily need to put it in the 12 watts that would be there it would not necessarily need to
convert all 12 it could be six watts if you know yeah I would just do not trigger the car
sensor but then again it might be it might be that you actually need to have real light bulbs sorry
I'm just working through all of this anyway because I am as you know trying to better get a better
handle on electronics in they myself anyway I also posted smoke and hot canvas LED lamps from
their big cloud.com channel where he takes some of these light bulbs and basically does what he
does best. Is there explosion involved I haven't seen that one. Just some of the melt gauve you put
them in the wrong way and your cheap stuff. Oh right right yeah yeah oh some of these nasty Chinese
ones because you get sort of matrix of multiple LEDs in it and a thing for a high powered spotlight
type thing got you. Yeah I think these ones were just little like circuit circuit boards with an LED
on both sides and that was it and they were just run that they had their maximum whack. Yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway I was going to say there's a guy who made a made an LED
torch that was incredibly bright and the amount of heat thinking he had to do to be blowing up
was sold out right there. Yes and did you want to do John then? No there you can. Okay John says
yikes mining up canvas so hopefully won't have melt dance. Yeah good stuff. So the kickstarter
from the Omega 2 plus first time walkthrough and this was from Jurello, Arduino
related device series and I did not know about the this actually I did I had a little look at the
time and but never never got into it. Yes yes do you think you meant that to be kickedstarter
because to be honest I noticed that I didn't notice it was going through. I will I will just
go and fix that when I get a second. Yeah I sort of vaguely heard about this Omega 2 but
I hadn't paid a lot of attention because it was IOT and I'm not sure quite to the keen on IOT
stuff in general but no I think it's a it's a good beginner kit but the thing about it is
the thing to put me off it was there are so many different modules that you could get and by the
time you get the more you're like 250 euros down the drain but yeah and I've already invested in
you know the whole Raspberry Pi ecosystem. Yeah well actually what I'm what I've ended up
happening is like I got the Raspberry Pi because I'm interested in turning on lights and stuff
and I was thinking oh that's that's interesting I was learned about that and then I learned about
that and I think Arduino is around you let's learn about that actually if I'm doing about
Arduino I can do it with integration circuits actually how do I just start this work
let's see who's this one. Yes you can yeah yeah it's easy to turn it with with bags and bags
and leaves and leaves of stuff don't get them. If you hear what this that's something I just bought
from from my Pi0 which turns it into I want to try and connect a serial device to it to see if I
could drive it to from a Pi. So it's a little serial interface that you stick on the on the top
serial Pi0 so you know it's I probably yeah I don't know how long it will take me to do it
years probably but could no doubt we will get a show on that when it gets done I shall certainly
tell you back thank you thank you I actually did a I went through the because I've been buying stuff
I ever since I've started doing tutorials and stuff with the Raspberry Pi and you think oh well
I'll get I get the I'll send away for that and I'll get that and then it goes back three weeks
later and then you know you have to bring kids to wherever and then you know life catches up with
you so I've actually this weekend went and did an inventory using Markdown and all the things
that I've purchased and have their and it's in gate and I have all their their you know PDFs
and breakdowns and links to the site where that explains the project and what it's used for and
oh cool that is really good yes but you know the virtual I think was and my bill who suggested
potten when he does a project he puts it in the components into a static bag and then keeps
the track of it so this is kind of my idea of doing the same thing only one in a Markdown
excellent yes I keep a ring behind it with this paper and I shall also do that because that's
quite handy but I don't actually have space now for a bookshelf yet out here but once I digitize
all my archive tapes and CDs and video tapes then I can have space but that's another project for
another day probably some woodworking to make a brochure and then change the handle
idea working a all alpha oscar 8.5 with my son and this was the absolute coolest episode sorry
this was my ideal episode and there was so annoying that he didn't get a contact
it yeah I thought oh yeah right I'm not all that much into amateur radio I was really
fascinating I was so rooting for him to to get through and to have a conversation or something
so shame it didn't didn't happen but it was it was it was quite gripping actually yeah yeah yeah
I am this actual thing this actual thing here is actually why I want to get into amateur radio is
for the tracking the satellite I just think it is so cool yes yeah now that was that was an
excellent show what I actually want to do is rig a an aerial and antenna so that it can automatically
track the satellites itself using motors so you don't have the the inconvenience of actually
having to stand outside that it would do it automatically and I don't know how that is the
end goal isn't that was that guy post him last year yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you'll be you'll
be following his in his footsteps or something that's what I was trying to to do with a little
yaggy antenna and see how how we do they have the automated relay stations that do the tracking
as the satellite comes over they over the horizon then you report back the signals from the satellite
so people doing what was this people doing where they get amateur satellite where there's a space
on the satellite that goes up they'll put in these amateur satellite boxes for you know universities
and hobby groups and then they'll just launch them because hey it's they couldn't fit anything else
in in that space and then you put the space up and but they don't have ground control stations so they
the idea was that you could get a global ground control network so that was what they were doing
very cool yeah yeah absolutely loved that show and the following day was building a new voice
input device jibber jabber are do you see the photos for this I didn't look I haven't looked in
detail I saw some of the photos as on new social as he was putting it together but yeah I thought
this phone was even older than 1970s it looks like something else of the 1930s you know what
here lord it's it's it's one with the with the microphone on set on the wall in it yeah detachable
earpiece is it yeah it's beautiful that opened up a lot of ideas for me you know like that you could
go a tube on the wall but you could blow into it oh I know indeed yes you just have to pull
a plug out of it and blow down it yeah exactly that would be awesome okay how do you know for that
yes and of course I'm inviting myself over to Jezre's house because that I think would be the
ultimate in museum visits he just have fun though didn't he yeah yeah yeah I wouldn't mind one
of those chip computers I don't know how easy they are to get in the UK yeah yeah it seems to be
a bit harder to get in they're on the states yes but I don't have the time to devote to this yeah
no I know I need to do I really but still okay so that was the shows and where we now we're
talking about are we missed any common stave well there was a bunch to previous shows so we don't
prepare so I do that so we had and groups was commenting our troops did a show on why people should
use handwriting to gain superpowers and Mauritius replied thanks I'm actually a final fountain
as well I love them but sometimes it's hard to explain the fascination to people who don't get it
me basically I don't know about anybody else but I've tried I'm get tired of the why every time
I mention fountain pens good to know I'm not one of the only ones yeah yeah well I appreciate that
did Mauritius know that if he does one more show it's a series yeah yeah we need more more
fountain pensions on the platoon raves about the table top game coup and non-descript says I took
a copy of coup when visiting relatives over the holidays it was a huge success thanks for bringing
the game to my attention cool that's nice and then we had on the why people say should say
GNU Linux FSA said some languages more offensive than others space man I thought for the most
part your episode is entertaining take on the subject mostly agree with with you on the philosophical
points behind it I am strongly opposed to censorship of any kinds FX Accentral don't bother me but
I would just ask to reconsider the retarded retarded as an insult I completely agree that's
me saying that again I completely against censorship but I'm not saying that you should be forced
to do or not prevent it from releasing episodes that use them in that way but I do think it's a
different sort of offense than generic words like folk ones of people just happened to not like
and Christopher M. Hobbs do you mind me doing these comments or do you jump in I'm sort of
following behind slow leave it this was on the Christopher M. Hobbs show about working amateur
radio satellites by Miguel and comments additional links hello Christopher and listeners
cool show now I want to pick up buy on attempts again some comments or answers I'm sat
is the international organization I'm sat-na is an American North American branch there are many
others you already mentioned I'm such UK the Oscar name is still present here's a link that
explains the rules I'm sat page ID2478 in short in the a-o-xx f-o-xx c-o-xx satellite names the
O stands for Oscar the first letter is usually linked to the organization or group that built the
satellite the problem of getting misled but dead satellites can be mitigated by consulting with
the satellite status page which is that I'm sat at a report that status first there you can see if
they're very recently have heard or worked a particular satellite regards Michael or Michele
mirror mirror next comment was by space man on the space man show victor commented twice victor
O comment number one was I love bots but I find it disrespectful when the bottom person it's a
human being I think a bot should identify themselves as bot I don't think anybody appreciates being
deceived next comment was on the side note I think you could share your findings I kind of would
like to open the database of stuff out there that you can download you know you can google anything
in the internet is easy acceptable but I would like to see to own a couple of turbines database
that index of the internet it's nice that you can download the DM or Z database and mirror
shade uh comment by clacky on mirror shades fun with a skills of silenoscopes bubble sort
and loved that the art artist put in a sorting algorithm illustration in lines I'm pretty
sure they're all bubble sorts though uh did anyone here watch the sorting out sorting it's a
classic in 2005 sadly it's no longer part of our algorithm's course we but we watched it
uh as a student body lore it's originally bhs that's the um that's tape the day day day day day
one second day for you uh disappeared no I'm still here I'm still here just give me one second no I
thought uh I'm gonna put a link into the show notes actually do you know what I'm gonna do Dave
is I want to put the link in an email and then send that to you and then there wasn't um so I
the video he's talking about is on youtube from bhs but he thought he was talking about the video
with the um with the dance the Hungarian dancers did you see that video I didn't see that no
he didn't say sorting yeah sorting uh just one second I'll see if I can get the link
so just sent both of those links to you one the first video I have not watched the second one
I have it's Hungarian dancers and they uh they they have like dressed in traditional costume and
they've got the numbers one to ten on the back and then they just do the dance sorting the
sunglasses ago that's absolutely mesmerizing I did this I did a sort thing for my
evening class yesterday and years ago in Pascal and I took in a deck of cards and showed them
in in one of the suits you know how you would do uh do a bubble sort to sort the thing you think
not a whole suit just maybe a subset of it and just actually seeing and demonstrating
in front of your eyes give you great insight into it's just a simple bubble sort it wasn't that
that's it but it's a fascinating thing I was the thing I used to do coming home from the
bubble was uh lord up the turbo Pascal had a had a thing where he could look at the
it had a graphical representation of the sorts and you could put on the the music one of the sample
programs was and you able to play it was brilliant if I happen to be doing this one night and they
my brother's roommate came down walked into the kitchen took the plug of the computer
went back up to fed it didn't say a word yes yes yes yes yes okay then we had a clean
podcast with no swearing a concern listener was saying I'm complete bullshit that people get
offended over words at a particular culture your occupants basements had actions speak louder
for I won't do no back censorship I'm quite concerned that any of this community would bow to
the fascist who desire censorship nobody was asking about censorship people were talking about
the shows been marked as clean and not those marked as explicit okay GWS says there's no
so things not knowledge transfer sure there is no one true method of teaching there's no one single
style of learning the point is that you're out of order that what you're doing it's not what you're
out of order is that you're going to alienate your audience is what it says yeah do you want to
read it yes if show responses stochastic and try not to become a statistic which is nice way
putting it I have no idea what that means no I don't know really stochastic meaning
random according to sort of a normal distribution or something like that so is that I don't know
don't know trying yeah I don't know that it's obviously a joke it looks like it should be
amusing but I don't really understand it's pure beyond my pay grade okay a couple of Brian said
excellent show as somebody with a strong interest in both history oh this is on the
plaques lowdown and what's open the Taiwan straight really enjoyed both history and politics
I really enjoyed this program love to hear more uh victor all says low I used to watch
China on sensor done YouTube I think China and Russia are very empirical complex has the rest
of the word listens to the US right they only act to protect their interests this is just waffle
okay fine they see the US as an intruder in their sphere of influence I think the mainland China
wants stations to deal with agents affairs it is convenient for them but that's what they want
anyway the US country of freedom refuses to allow south to succeed when they want to to
and the say Trump makes Hispanics really angry and religions dominated by Hispanics so much that
they want to succeed the government reviews military force to prevent it I doubt any government
today would allow a region to succeed peacefully okay I don't really know what that has got to do
with the the show because the show basically was very clear that both China and Taiwan consider
themselves to be part of China and the fact that I don't think the US was mentioned at all in this
okay fine that was it that was comments yes thank you very much sorry to uh I'm just a lot
slower than you no I'm not ahead Dave I need to go to bed here I got a good morning uh yes
anyway that was an interesting interesting what else was there oh did we miss the
mailing list now I've been very busy with them uh very busy with getting the HPR uh you know I've been
doing the posters thing for the foster them every time we go to foster them I will I do all these
interviews yeah and just give people a background and every time I spend a whole week afterwards
trying to guess basic things like what the project is about where their logo is and all the
stuff so this time I had a brilliant idea that if we do that beforehand that I could um you know
save myself a lot of work which hopefully I will but then I also volunteered to do some posters
and stuff and then uh wrote a program to convert a spreadsheet into a PDFs and uh actually did you
see the the latest latest version now Dave you showed me a version last week I think it was
right I've done a new one I want to make a soldier the link I'm on my other computer and my
mouse during the other room so uh so i've been following dot com forward slash files forward slash
stans dot pdf yep camp on dot com forward slash stans dot pdf so basically it's got the projects logo
at the top portion of the screen and then it's got a QR code to the website a short blur a big
QR code to the website a left of that then is a description underneath the QR code is the URL
and then the bottom right hand corner is the um location table location the building and then the
table number so I now uh spent a lot of time getting the logos yeah yeah yeah it's quite
quite impressive yeah that's a hell of a task you took on that it was it was one of those
tasks that you know three hours in you go this is going to take me another two hours but now I'm
already three hours in so what am I going to do so yeah but I got it done it's I think it I uh
there are three here but I printed them off and they force are a sorry they're four here but then
I enlarge them up to a three so hopefully they'll be nice because it's amazing like the number the
pearl project does not have a logo that you can download that is bigger than the size of a coin
Google code in doesn't have a logo you know so you just think why do these people like
grob doesn't have a logo that's weird isn't it you just it'd be uh yeah yeah yeah you just
thought it was a great Linux right which has got funding from the Linux foundation uh has logos
for all the car companies that supported yes doesn't have a oh I shouldn't be saying any of this
actually because people are listening but you've got a tiny little logo on it and then you got
other websites like um pre-BSD and gnome have entire pages devoted to here's you can get them
here's the big version here's the version from Mac here's how you book ship up and this is
dues this is don't which is also excellent so there you go yep yeah anyway doing that's very good
you know I'm I'm sad I can't make it this year and so to to see all this good stuff so
yes take a picture take a picture I will do I will I'm not going to guarantee you I'm doing
anything because uh you know what it's like you go there yeah I know I'm going tomorrow afternoon
and I heard that they can they're setting up the stands early so I'm gonna try and I'm gonna pass
out these thingies and I'm gonna try and get some interviews there so then because of 74 or
something like that different boots so it's a lot of a lot of recordings yeah absolutely absolutely
and it's it's usually quite a lot as well I mean every year that you you've been you've spent
just for every every possible yeah I'm actually going to see in it it doesn't do any talks
or anything it's been pretty much off the table it largely isn't it it's yeah impossible which
was actually thinking uh you know you were asking about uh whether it was going to um show uh show
for just 17 the um the one the Netherlands yeah don't you think SHA 2017 yeah that's one I don't
think so I think with that money and you're only starting with that I would probably get a ticket
to Liverpool or wherever all comes got to be and you know just sit at the outcome table and enjoy
sitting at a table with people rather than doing interviews or something 250 euros is the cheapest
price to get in and seeing and to seem quite expensive haven't fully appreciated yeah but then
it's a it's a campsite for a week so you know that's cheap by that standard you know you got free
Wi-Fi you got electricity you got the full works you got the toilets you got the yeah that's true
it's true it is cheap for the for the price and fairness because it's a shame there's not I thought
there might be a non camping price or something you know it's pretty uh I could go in begging on the
HBR ticket but you know at the same time at the same time yes yeah okay fair enough so wherever we
we are doing they mainly uh mail is the email yeah yeah so a lot of chatter about the amateur radio
stuff finally getting the amateur radio people out of the closet which is awesome uh some of the
if you are a ham and want to get involved in the amateur radio round table that's going to be
coming up shortly and it'll be hopefully a regular show where you can um basically answer my questions
and uh yeah I'm looking forward to hearing the show yes yes it's uh it's in the queue now I think
it's it's uh yep it's um but as you know we don't know we don't listen ahead know this very
bad but yeah looking forward to it sounds good I thought I saw since I processed the notes
there was some commenty effect that the next one could well be at different time to be more
Europe friendly so okay so that would be cool yep um let me see they lost and Bronx replied to a
digest he yeah I said can I take you off the digest list and he said no no no I don't want to be
off that list because he likes replying to the digest obviously yep um I lit night linux and you
post a new podcast so uh post it that out um more about the amateur radio there was some trouble
with the Yahoo and the HVR mailing list can you give us some right right right yes yes um what we
have is that Yahoo have a strange policy um on their mail so I haven't got the message open in
front of me just hold on a second so it's they're using a thing called DMARC I linked to it in the
email and what it means is that anything sent by Yahoo uses anywhere is is checked against their
policy so if it goes through the mailman list then what mailman does is it it makes it look as if
it's come from Yahoo because it forwards it and and as a consequence the people the other sites say
oh Yahoo right they've got this policy oh but it's come through another server it's been relayed
so we can't have that so we'll throw it away so um what you can do is there's a setting in
mailman which allows you to to which which which makes mailman deal especially with this case when
there's a DMARC uh policy of a particular sort and it will um change the the way it sends stuff so uh
I switched this on but unfortunately it hasn't taken effect because I think Josh needs to go and
kick the mailman servers but I've asked him to do this but I've not heard back from him so I'm not
sure where we where we stand with this at the moment I'll I'll hassle him again soon I don't want to
hassle him too much for the poor guy's busy yeah oh we're um we're also having this thing with the
mails going to the admin at hackupublicradio.org are getting through the are getting through but
you get uh no user exists message back so then people are sending mails to the HPR mailing list um
so what just fine but um I'm a bit concerned now because I've got all the business cards I've got
admin at HPR on them and I'm going to be handing those out to people so um yes like to get that one
fixed yeah yeah it's probably something quite simple because the the uh the message server on the
em I'm trying to think about now the mta on the on the hpr system is saying there is no such
person there's no such account as admin at um at hackupublic radio which there isn't I mean
there doesn't have to be because it's a it's a list it's an expander isn't it but I think
something's something's misconfigured that it thinks that this is an actual user it's got two
types of security on it so something like that yeah but at the same time we are we are
under attack yeah yes we don't want to have loose security but on the other hand it seems
unnecessary I think it just just needs a bit tweaking anyway let's leave it at that yeah but I
think a lot uh he has another server ready for us um he just needs the time in order to move
everything over um and I think we'll get a major upgrade at that point as well so
so i'll leave it with uh leave it with uh Josh he has never let us down as yet
beef jerky i let Josh dance and i mentioned that because he was in Edinburgh uh at the start
and we failed to meet we have to be failed to meet it was such such a news so it went to his hotel
and somehow i couldn't get in touch with him so uh sorry Josh sorry
anyway you don't exist Dave you're a figment of my imagination you're just in the matrix admitted
it's the robot yeah anyway sorry to interrupt on you go no beef jerky you can do migraine
right has a taste while i find the right taz it i don't do not bother us are doing this y'all do
you know it's not just you sitting there are commenting yeah i just you know why i pay you the big book
i'm using bloody ubuntu over here and it's such a horrible thing i hate it and for some reason i don't
anyway um it's it's got some old and can't can't deal with new things so it was um migraine commenting on
operators show the one where he talked about silica jell crystals and drank them and they
haven't he made a passing reference to jerky so that was it and that was so it's some beef jerky
says we don't have here in the uk but uh i think it's a bit like what they call billtong in south
africa so how about a show about how to make beef jerky with what mike's asking yeah good
answer you have nice on nice on mike yes catching on jesra emailed about the link not coming through
which turns out it's the thing it was a spam folder or something oh is that what happened yeah
yeah okay there's there's a few there's a yeah uh we're also seeing bounces for um
uh tim timmy marshal uh through the mailing list i've told him about it but i don't think he
can fix it i don't know i haven't heard back from him i think after three bounces or something
gets taken out automatically no it's fair number of them but but certainly there will come a point
where it gets removed from the list they're also getting bounces from the tllts guys but
no anymore no anymore no i think they they were reconfiguring their mail system
and uh i tried to contact them and couldn't but then later on i did manage to get through to them
and they said oh sorry and it was because somehow although they were bad addresses on our on a
mailing list so um so everything is sold now i think anyway so we had uh uh flinger roi who sent
a wedge interview from linuxconf.au which i'm looking forward to they're up there on the website
just because we don't listen to the shows before they're posted you don't have to
there's even a feed where you can get shows as they come in uh and i'll leave that up to you
to figure out how to do that and uh he's just interested to know how his new um microphone sounds
like yeah cool and kevan and the troops were looking forward to basically hearing the shows as
am i amateur radio roundtable note show notes it's that's more an admin sort of question
and uh tag interface uh clinton roi asked is there a tag interface uh epst up php tag equals
something or other and the answer is no there isn't but there could be
and uh yeah you're doing a show on that i mean you yes i i'm showing so let's just leave it at that
i think i've got three three shows to do explaining the ins and outs of this stuff i just thought
i thought you'd be happy it was going to be one humongous show but then i thought uh it's not
that's not what we're all here it's not three it's three so first ones in the queue next one
will be long soon so that that'll maybe start the ball rolling i hope although you do have uh
there there is a way to search an archive.org query the collection hacker public radio and subject
raspberry pi will return all the raspberry pi itself it's kind of cool yes yes yes it's uh i was
delighted to find there are nice ways to do in that now you can do some quite powerful stuff there
so go and uh go and hack it and see what you can get and uh spelling fix and how to pull shows on
the various horse people on the mailing list are seeing basically my inbox for the month on
these little issues and things that people have posting shows that we usually just deal with
it's partly because i had minute at hacker public radio you said go away i'm not here
