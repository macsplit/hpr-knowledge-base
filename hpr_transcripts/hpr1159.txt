Hello and welcome to this episode of Hacker Public Radio.
My name is Dudeman.
I have a little podcast on technology over Hacker at Dudemanovie.cz where I talk about technology
but one of my big pet interests is animal husbandry feeding my family kind of a self-sufficiency.
I love playing about with gadgets and do-dads, Arduino, Arch Linux, distros, you know,
I love gadgets, I can't put them down but the point of my podcast is to be interested in all
technologies, not just modern ones and if you've listened I did an episode on hacking and programming
recently but trying to stretch out the appeal to beyond just say one particular programming language
but applying it to our whole life and in this episode I would like to bring to you a subject
very close and dear to me and my family which is food, what is healthy food and what should we eat
to be healthy. Now I know something we've been studying and doing in a very practical sense
for the last ten years. The book I'm going to mention now, the original one is called Western
A Price Nutrition and Physical Degeneration and I'm going to describe a little bit about it
but it's a wonderful book, I'll write some notes and you can find the descriptions in the show notes
but you know there are different schools of thoughts you know if you're a vegetarian or vegan
that there's so many different diets and fats and I am with my wife kind of the person who
is eternally trying to stay open-minded and looking to every aspect there was a point in our lives
where we were dabbling with vegetarianism and macrobiotics and being interested in some of these
things but we didn't find anything else which was which was as sensibly written and logical as what
I'm going to try to describe to you now so if you are a vegetarian or you're that way inclined
if you just keep an open mind and I'm not trying to convert anybody here but I think it is important
to mention some of these things and to kind of start a dialogue or a conversation and
mention some alternative for which isn't in the mainstream at all but if you're able to look
a few of these websites I'm going to mention then you might be fascinated by some of the research
and the evidence to back up what I'm going to talk about so basically I guess I should say you
know if you enjoy butter and cream and full-fat milk and you know fat on your meat and you know
good old-fashioned foods and bacon you know I hear some Linux-y type tech podcast people talking
about bacon you know who I'm talking about door to door and other people you know I love bacon as
well and I want to give you a way to actually allow yourself to eat these things because they are
actually very important but like many things you know there's an element of truth in in everything
you know everything sometimes there's kind of half truth and you know it is true that the milk
today is unhealthy and that's it's connected with the way it's produced and that the way the
animals are grown and the way it's produced and you know it's pasteurized and homogenized and
the cows aren't given proper food and is not even the correct type of cow you know but if we fix
those things and return back to how cows were kept 100 to 100 years ago or how we keep our cows
today because we have a few in our shed outside in the meadows in the summer just for our own
personal personal satisfaction when we drink our lovely cold milk full of cream and I can see
there are beautiful rosy faces of my children but if if if we talk about foods and and know the
difference that it's we're not talking about industrial meats here we're not in talking about
industrially processed milk you know so if I'm talking about these kinds of foods which are demonised
now I'm not talking about the way they're the way they're produced nowadays but the way that they
should be produced on a small scale and to a much higher quality but you know there's a there's
lots of talk about cholesterol and low fat diets and you know rather having vegetable oils instead
of the the old traditional saturated fats lad and butter unfortunately if you spend any time now
looking into some of these these evidence I'm going to try and describe to you now it's all a
great big myth this this this information that's being pushed out to the mainstream media and
the mainstream people about what is healthy um to be honest if you listen to any dietary
recommendations you'd probably be a lot better off if you just ate the exact opposite and the
the obesity epidemic and many of those other things are more attributed to the high sugar diet
and the high corn and grain diet and and starchy bread and what have you and then fats there is
actually a wonderful book called I think it's eat fat lose fat basically the premises you you
don't get fat by eating fatty things you know you get fat by eating nutrient nutrient undense you know
food which isn't good for you because something strange happens in your body
and your body's reaction is to actually cling on to to all the energy which goes into your body and
and not process process and burn it at all and that is how you get fat and this is contrary
possibly to a living you've heard before but that is my job is to to mention something perhaps a
little radical or perhaps a little unusual to poke you all in the ribs a little bit and get us
all to think but the subject I really want to talk about and describe briefly now is the book
called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Western A price and Western was a dentist a very
successful dentist in the US I mean the 1920s and 30s I believe and I'm eternally grateful to him
because he he did what isn't done now very often it seems to me by scientists he did a truly
scientific piece of work which helped in thousands of thousands of people now and he went and he
found healthy people which were in isolated communities which hadn't yet been touched by modern
civilization by the civilized foods like white sugar and processed white breads and the canned
goods and and of course the lifestyle which went with that but they because usually because of
geological location they were isolated you know there was one Austrian or Swiss group I think
community and they were down in a valley and it was inaccessible only by foot in the summer you
know so the whole of the year accepts you know good weather in the summer it was inaccessible so
they had to be completely self-sufficient and dependable upon themselves and they had been through
generation after generation and you know they didn't have tooth decay of course as Western his first
concern was tooth so he took with him his entourage traveling those days it wasn't as it is now
you know you don't jump on a plane and a bus and get driven into the place these places were
inaccessible and I guess he planned for weeks or months how to get there which people's to visit
all this communication and collaboration to to even meet these people and of course he didn't have
an iPhone or an SLR camera to easily take pictures but he took thousands of pictures in the old
fashion way on these glass sheets had them shipped back as well as taking samples of the foods
these people were eating so he can analyze them back in the labs later and I believe he visited
about 14 or so isolated separated geographically around the world groups and the things he noticed is
they didn't eat all the same foods but what they did did had a few things in common and they ate
nutrient dense food and that wasn't and also they they process the foods in specific ways
which we have especially in modern modernized processing plants and the way we we want to speed up
the process now for our foods we have actually forgotten you know I'm quite lucky here in the
Czech Republic because some of this information you know is still kind of common knowledge and
practiced although it's it's probably overwhelmed by the amount of alcohol and sugar that is consumed
here in the Czech Republic unfortunately I believe in in Europe Czech Republic is the second
only to the United Kingdom for obesity rates and and what's it called the sugar defect that people
have diabetes that's well anyway so he he visited those 14 groups and of course he discovered
very few dental cavities in the young and the old you know people 90 years old or a hundred
with perfectly healthy teeth you know maybe damaged because they might have fallen over and
bashed the tooth out occasionally or you know but had very very few you know in the one or two
percent dental cavities and they had dirty teeth because maybe their their food their dental
hygiene was low and they didn't it wasn't normal to be brushing all the time and keeping them
clean because it's actually a myth the the damage to teeth I I'm understanding from all of this
it doesn't occur necessarily from the outside the the the terrain exists because we don't have
the correct food to keep our bones and our and our teeth and our hair and you know all of the
parts of our body strong and that allow and then it creates a terrain where you're nearest and
cavities and then attack us from the outside it's really fascinating sometimes for my wife and I
you know we we study all this and then we we listen to the advice that dentists give you know and
there was there was in the Czech Republic here on a website my wife found and it was you know
dentist advice how to look after your teeth there was like 10 or 20 points and the 20th you know
the lowest priority was mentioned of you know nutrient you know good food but he didn't specify
at all what that good food was well anyway I'm going to try here and mention the good nutrient
dense foods and and then some of the foods which are problematic and we will probably want to
just to give you an idea of the kind of direction I'm going to go in then I thought I would
mention the the differences in the shapes of the people and the tendencies towards the the way
that the children will grow and then what happened to those to the the children of just 10 years after
they those isolated groups of people change their diets after they've been penetrated by the
modernization you know they the roads have been built through to their previously independent and
isolated communities and they started trading you know trading their furs and whatever they
produced locally and sometimes even their food they they started to trade their good food for
canned and processed goods which were had been mass produced and as a result it was quite a
shocking what happened to them to be honest but so the good foods you know some of the things we
want to focus on as nutrient dense foods are you know milk butter fat but all of these all of these
sources of food are from non industrialized and well cared for animals you know so in a sense
I believe and and empathize with a lot of the values that vegetarians have and the the sort of
disgust towards the way that a lot of farming or animal husbandry practices are are carried out
nowadays and so if I'm suggesting non vegetarian type things it's with the understanding that
that those practices are done in a humane and a high quality way we personally keep a few cows
Jersey cows very high fat high fat milk but only for our own consumption and we we do eat the
bulls and the meat but we don't keep them just for that you know I don't enjoy killing animals but
I hope as you listen in listen on that you're you'll come to understand that for growing people
and for even aging or for adults wanting to conceive easily healthy children then it is very
important to have these nutrient dense foods so maybe I should have planned this all a little bit more
and really try to make it a multi-part episode but that's not my way I'm gonna ramble a little bit
thank you for bearing with me some more of the foods you know often maligned nowadays are
internal organs you know liver kidneys heart the the blood of the animal and again you know
we have been trained not to think about these things but in the past those those parts of the
animal if an animal has to be tortured were valued much more highly than just fat it's in
this meat sorry and talking about meat it is actually he found that Western price that it was
very important to have not lean meat but very important to eat meat with the fat connected to it
again that's something else which is much maligned nowadays and it's often true that to find
the truth if you simply follow the money and you know just think for yourself a little bit
what is easier to produce and mass process you know so that they can maximize the profit margins
well it's very difficult to mass produce healthy fresh you know dairy and high quality meat and
you know insanely and beautifully butchered with compassion towards the animals it's not really
conducive to mass production you know and of course these are probably influencing factors why
the information has been told to us as to what is healthy has gone in the direction it has you
know more towards more easily available you know grains and soya and more vegetables and fruits
unfortunately what Western A price discovered is the the foods that we are now eating and
are being told that are healthy to us nowadays these primitively you know isolated peoples weren't eating
you know so I carry on describing the things they were eating so it's butter milk you know
animal saturated fats and plenty of them really much higher quantities and we'd ever consider
at least in these modern days but maybe we should reconsider that in turn on organs you know liver
kidneys brains eyes it's another thing if you have weak and an alien eyes you know the best way
to get what your eyes eyes need is to eat and consume the the elements of your in eyes you know
our brains you know and a lot of these foods are considered to be kind of aphrodisiacs you know
they they give us this potency and energy and there is a reason for that because you know they contain
you know the sort of life given for the next generation I hope you understand what I mean there
without being crude but these things are very true and this this nutrient dense food which gives us
that vitality and I don't just mean in a sexual way but gives us that vitality and energy and
passion for life those are the things that we should be consuming not the the food types which
kind of slows down and make us feel suffragic and keep us calm you know so that's an idea of some
of the the foods but there's also emphasis on how to prepare bread properly for example you know
there's a problem with high gluten in in bread and a lot of the old original grains
what they call there's a greenish grain here
rye that's the world I was looking for a rye bread you know it was and some of the old varieties
wheat as well but they used to cook with much lower gluten but of course you can't cook such
fancy smooth kind of pastries which are more sort of sticky and sort of finer if you use rye
because it's basically the gluten which holds it all together I believe anyway it's it's also
in modern modern times you know we're told that you need to have whole wheat bread well if you
read in any commercial whole wheat bread it's it can be quite difficult to digest and and it needs
to be processed properly and steps in you know very simple old-fashioned technology and it's called
sourdough and you know if you enjoy bread and you're prepared to kind of accept a different
a different idea of what what it can taste like some old-fashioned taste look up sourdough
and it's amazingly simple to make all you need is a best freshly ground low gluten grains make
your own flour of course make it whole wheat leave every bit in it and you just add water you know
wait a few days let those natural bacteria come in and it's really not much more to making bread
than just allowing the natural bacteria to come in mixing the flour getting you know a bit thicker
letting it rise banging it in the oven you know before my wife took over the bread making about
five years ago six years ago I was making the family bread for a good few years before she really
took hold of this whole food as I'm describing now and now she does a wonderful job of making bread for
us also vegetables you know vegetables are healthy but we do need to understand they aren't
nutrient dense there might be some some elements in even them if they are grown in really high
quality you know ground and they can be quite difficult to digest you know and Western A price
he found that they were vegetables and a lot of grains I's probably too much to not enough time
now on too many details to go into but they would be fermented they would be sort of dry that
there were different ways of processing them in order to remove either like difficult to digest
elements you know for example beans they need to be soaked in a certain way to remove indigestable
elements which also make them not the taste very nice you know and vegetables it's beneficial for
many of them to actually be fermented and it actually makes them taste much better additionally a
lot of this processing even my wife has been discovering recently the processing of meats
not only did it allow those vegetables to be stored very easily for longer periods of times but
it meant that they were partially digested and more available and easier to digest less of a burden
on our digestive systems and our bodies and all the goodness more available if they were
processed in this way and there was less need for fridges and refrigerations so there really is
a lot more to for example smoking and and curing meat than just for its taste benefits you know
my wife has recently the last pick we killed she has been curing in vinegar for a few days
and different mixtures the meat and when she cooks it is just so quick to cook and it's so
soft and tasty and juicy it's amazing I can't believe all these years we've been having just
you know you know unsoaked and processed in vinegar meat from for many animals you know it was
so much nicer so hopefully I've mentioned just some of the foods which I mentioned in this book
that the the people's ate but and of course the the things that they didn't eat were the highly
processed foods mostly containing sodium which isn't really the the sort that people are
reaching in the days you know sodium is just the the salt element I'm not a chemist or anything but
I understand it's it's devoid of the minerals you know and salt is actually just like I said
earlier there is a half truth that nowadays a highest salty now diet is bad for us it is actually
true high sodium which is the modernized highly processed salt just like processed sugar
is bad for us what we really need is salty now diet is very important but we need a high mineral
salt and unprocessed processed in in a much more natural software so those minerals and elements
which are very important for us aren't destroyed so we salt is good you know and but we don't
want the the bad highly processed salt with no minerals of course sugar white sugar have a look
up a sugar blues and what sugar does to our bodies you know the strain it creates on the adrenal
gland I believe that's the gland and the sort of the escalating the ups and the downs have a
search for sugar blues and the effects on on the cravings and the desires for for foods which
contain sugar and salt you know we don't have to think too much to try and understand why
is sugar and salt being put to such large quantities in the highly processed foods because
it is very addictive it creates this sort of rush of energy when we have it and then you know
fairly shortly afterwards of consuming any of those foods we we sort of plummet down and this
continue for a few years 20 years 10 years however long of upwards and downwards you know it
creates a terrible strain on our bodies and our adrenal glands and you know if we let it go on
unchecked and it can create more complicated problems but it creates an addiction you know
because we've always craved when they never satisfies us you know so and of course high gluten
processed and low quality bread that's another it's an anti nutrient and and not conclusive not
conducive to healthy people you know but now maybe you're asking well I'm making all these
statements how do I know and how can you tell what is it doing to people you know what do what
people look like who have grown up on healthy food and what are the characteristics the the body
shapes the the tendencies in people who have had bad food well western a price he discovered this
as well as having very very straight and strong and well spaced teeth you know the the people
he found had no need for for dental correction they had no need for braces and or removing teeth
and straighting them like even in his day in the US in the 20s and 30s he was that they were
using braces I understand and and many people had crowded teeth and to be honest you know it's
very difficult nowadays even you know if you if I asked somebody you know why do people young
children why aren't the teeth straight in our mouths why do we need at a certain age to remove
a few teeth either side and then to put these metal constructions on and straighten them you know
didn't god didn't nature whoever it is you know design human body just perfectly you know
well why doesn't it grow straight well western a price discovered and proved and recent people
who have been practicing what he suggests have discovered in their own children that there have
been no need for braces so a few of the practices well maybe I should carry on describing the the
shapes of people so as well as having teeth which actually fitted in the mouths of these people
in good condition so they didn't need braces to straighten them or anything like that
low amounts of cavities he also found that people would generally shorter and broader
were very fine figures you know the the the the the men were short and stocky and stout and they
looked really capable not necessarily because they were working terribly hard but they had that
sort of ruggedness and strength and durability about them which which you don't often see
in modernized peoples I know it's possible to go to the gym and to bulk ourselves up to look
tough but that's that's not the kind of toughness I'm talking about it's even it's easy it's
interesting you know even here in the Czech Republic all the older people are extremely short
you know because of socialism here they they had up to about 20 years ago before the
capitalism was introduced in a rush there was a lot the the foodstuffs were much higher quality
you know the the modern ideas of what is healthy and what isn't the healthy hadn't been
introduced into the Czech Republic so they were eating lots of cream and fat and butter and
they were eating lots of those foods of course along with sugars and processed foods but
um you know in the countryside where where those people had access they looked different to the
people in the cities so they were shorter broader and the reason I mentioned this is because my my
wife my Czech wife's grandparents you know she remembers how her her grandfather was so short
and so broad you know and he was sort of almost as broad as he was short but he wasn't necessarily
stronger I think you know but he was just short and broad and you can still see that as as you
walk around and see the old people especially in away from the big cities and in the countryside
so western A price he discovered that the people in these primitive groups isolated societies
and communities they were shorter broader so you know we don't have to think too far but answer
me this when I was growing up everybody else seemed to be taller than me you know my my parents
and everybody seemed to think well why aren't why aren't I as tall as everybody else and everyone
else is shooting up but I'm not growing as quick as they are you know but it's actually a good thing
you know it's actually good not to shoot up and be massively tall because it's actually a degenerative
disease or degenerative problem connected with malnutrition and you know maybe your your eyes
are going around and you head and you're thinking dude man what are you talking about this is
absolute nonsense well I ask you just to to study a little bit this little book and the website
westernaprice.org and see for yourself if you have any interest or if if you're a tall intrigued
by these things I mentioned and you know so there is a phenomenon now with young people seemingly
getting taller and taller as generation goes on and western A price discovered this and noticed
himself and noticed it in the same groups once they started eating different foods and made the
connection there's a phenomenon now that often the youngest child in the family is the tallest
and the the oldest the first child is the shortest and this is if you consider the nutrition
that the oldest son might have had slightly better nutrition from his mother being the the first
child and progressively as the mother has a few more children and often she would have the children
too close to each other this is this is another idea I should quickly mention that before children
were conceived in these societies you know they would be a little bit strict there was nice
examples in the the I think the the Austrian Alp villages that they would marriages weddings would
occur in the late summer and you know they were they knew why they had marriages in the late
summers because the young children the young young people who were getting married they would have
all seasoned to have you know the best milk and butter and cheese from the from the fast growing
grass from their cows you know they'd have the all the energy and the life from that that spring
and summer you know to to nourish their bodies so that once they got married of course the first
thing they're going to do or one of the first things is to go and start practicing creating children
and when you conceive children they wanted to make sure that the young people the young people's
bodies and sort of health had been pumped up by good food they were other other societies who
would deliberately when when two people were going to conceive before they would try and conceive
maybe six months beforehand they would they would elect somebody in the tribe maybe two people
to travel off every day and to get the right kind of food for both the man and the woman
so that the eggs and the sperm and everything would be at his fullest potential so they would be
able to conceive easily and so all of the DNA and everything which is transferred during that phase
is maintained and is in the highest quality so that the child would have the the best start
and grow well and it's very beautiful and these things are ignored but nowadays
in the main so they would also practice a larger intervals between each child
three or four years before in between conceive in each child and in some societies it was
really frowned upon you know that you're doing a disservice to your to your to the next child
if you conceive him too early you know because there isn't enough time for the mother to really
recover all of her strength and you know it's it's really underestimated the amount it takes
from from a mother be it a human mother or a bovine cow or mother how much it takes to give birth
you know you know maybe in animal husbandry or any kind of animal breeding for pets or dogs
maybe you keep dogs that it is really important what you feed your dog so your cows or
your sheep and of course the same applies to your children you know but often in our stressful
lives we don't have time to even consider this and we are actually told by the mainstream and our
doctors that these things aren't important and we are led to believe that they will fix it all you
know but unfortunately just like in hacking and Linux and computers often is better to rely upon
yourself more and do everything you can and not rely that someone else would do it for you you know
so they would practice a large intervals between conceiving children and some of these practices
to maximize the the health of the next generation because it's very important especially
if you don't have all you know the industrial machines and everything to make life easy
you need to make sure that everybody in the community in the societies is happy and healthy
and vibrant you know it's like the the weakest link in the chain is the one you know that the
whole chain will break for any weakest link so it's in all of our best interest to make sure that
that everybody has the best potential you know and and of course if you're isolated and you
all depend upon each other for survival for the long hard winters and you've got to harvest you
know all your food and and make and do everything yourselves then you need to make sure you're
strong and capable everybody is you know there's no no dead wood so whatever characteristics that
these people have so they were shorter broader they easily conceived they had good teeth
they a lot I mean they didn't need prisons they they didn't have crime or
or societal problems and that's probably a lot connected with with you know everybody being
very happy and and satisfied because you know it does make a difference what you eat if you eat
if your body is for you know you know the feeling if you're hungry you tend to be a bit irritable
well if you just extrapolate that a little bit more and say well if my body is hungry for the
nutrients that I had I didn't give it I what I ate just now my belly is full so I don't feel
irritated like I would be if I wasn't hungry but my body is sort of crying out for the good food
so maybe maybe my body is not able to to have patience in that situation or have perseverance you
know so it really is a prerequisite to make sure that every function of our body is is you know
given what it really needs to to a function you know just like if there's any part of our body
which is missing what it needs and that's that's a weak link in the chain and it's going to cause
problems another thing I should quickly mention is it was a little shocking after I finished reading
this book and I think it's something that opened up my eyes very much is what what do the face what
does the face of a healthy person look like and you know you can't change you know if you've you
and all of these all of these discussions when I'm when I'm talking about you know the shape of
somebody or whether they're tall or short and that's a sign of degeneration or that's not good
it's it's a sensitive thing and I'm really I'm not judging the the sort of spirit or the
the good or badness of that person it's like the first thing a husband and go look at him when
he's buying a horse he should be you know the way he walks the the shape of his legs the horse his
legs and have a look inside and have a look at his teeth well I'm just trying to apply the same
logic so at least we know what's going on I'm really you know don't want to cause any offense to
this I'm I'm not in perfect condition myself I grew up in a in a town had bad food all my life
in except the last 10 years where I've changed at myself after I know about these things and
I can definitely see the difference in my own children even compared to the shapes and the
the disposition of the friends and family with similarly age children or even my my brothers
families and other situations and and even when I make these these comparisons I don't mean
to be cruel or or pointing but just if if you're interested at all it's just as an example you know
so please don't be offended or upset if I say these things but so the shape of people's faces you know
as well as being shorter and broader the shape of the generation is shown in the shape of our face
maybe we're aware of the phenomenon of nose breathes this this is a class of people are a category
and maybe it the doctors seem to think it's genetic or it's it's something inherited because
you know your father or your mother was also a nose breathing nose breathing just means that
your the nasal passages aren't broad enough really and it's very difficult to breathe through
the nose so people tend to have their mouths open and breathe through the mouth and this doesn't
make a person bad but it's definitely inconvenient because we were designed to breathe through our
nose and it's a very important function but it has a very simple basis and if you're about to
conceive children or if you have young children which are growing rapidly you can have a big
impact upon how they're going to grow by changing what they eat so that's one aspect
another aspect is the the shape of the jaw there's there's something called over bite or
under bite and it's basically the the lower jaw kind of sticking out and the the teeth not
meshing together properly and it can be you know over or under one way or the other and it it
creates if you look at a side profile of a person it it either gives the idea that a person has a
chin which is in wood slightly or a chin which is sticking out and this is another aspect connected
with the development of the jaw which is affected by the nutrition you know bones need calcium you
know and I think the best source of calcium is in milk even though that's much maligned nowadays
for good reason because he's industrialized and homogenized and pasteurized but you know raw milk
but there needs to be the fat in the milk you know so we need a high fat raw milk and
even better if there's plenty of high quality butter you know you wouldn't believe the quantity of
butter we eat and if you were to look at me I hope I'm a kind of picture of a hell for I don't
have any kind of obesity problem even though I'm looking and eating as much cream and butter as I can
and plenty of fried foods and lard and meat and some vegetables fermented and some grains but
mostly those nutrient dense foods which I really enjoy but back to the shape of people's faces
you know there is this perception that you know models female models and what beauty looks like
the image which is sold to young people of tall and skinny and to be honest after I read this book
and I informed myself a little bit my perception of a beautiful girl a beautiful woman has
completely or a beautiful boy for that matter beautiful looking man has completely transformed
and I have a terrible time finding somebody that I find is beautiful you know because we all like
to look at beautiful objects or beautiful people you know it's it's very strangely but it definitely
true but my perception now of beauty is broad faces you know eyes which are wider part big fat noses
you know and a child or an adult with their mouths closed you know because the noses work properly
and the beautiful thing is all of this is attainable even if the parents or young
young adolescents haven't had the benefit of the best food once this knowledge is understood
and executed with some conscientiousness and it takes some effort to source these foods and
to learn how to cook them you know and to change our taste buds but the the impact on the next
generation and the transformation from having the tendency towards our children being taller than us
towards the tendency of our children being shorter you know which am broader is it can happen
over one generation you know and you can see it in your in your young children and it can really
demonstrate for you the truth in this kind of nutritional wisdom which I'm trying to share here with you
I think that I'm going to try and make this a multi part I was speaking to somebody just before
I started recording this over on the augcast IRC and he was interested very much in permaculture
and mentioned a few other things which I've been educating myself about the last 10 years since I've
been interested in all of this and I would like very much to to talk about all of this a bit more
and to start discussing some of these things because it really is in the line of in the line of
hacking and programming and it's so interesting and intriguing you know so I look forward to that as well
so I think there will be some future episodes and follow ups to this episode I hope
there there was one interest in chapter at the end of the book and perhaps a little controversial
but it was just a simple study of the the shapes of the faces of conflicts in in the US in those 1920s
and 30s I'm not sure how serious or how far it was done but it was quite easy to observe when you
start to get an idea of these facial characteristics which lead to which are signs of the generation
and basically you know if you have a body which hasn't grown to its full potential maybe
you're sort of stooped over a little bit your head is down your your sort of taller and thinner
than you should be maybe your your nose is is more narrow and you have problems breathing
maybe your eyes are closer together and because your face your whole skeletal structure
hasn't grown to the breadth it should grow your eyes don't work so well all of these kind of
physical characteristics or attributes of your body which have been formed throughout your life
and have been built from what you eat you know as well as of course the the lifestyle of that
person maybe he was kind of in a in a poor neighborhood maybe you know some inner city district
and had some unfortunate background you know but all of those those things you can see them more
prevalent in the disadvantage in the criminal you know and it's in this we're not to poke fingers
or anything but you know whereas the at least in those days the the middle class would have access
to better foods and wouldn't have those kind of degenerative attributes in their in their facial
structures and their skeletal and their and which would affect them you know so I hear sometimes
these kind of charitable organizations talking about you know bringing nutritional food out to
people you know to to help these underprivileged people and then I hear mention of what food they
bring out and I think oh my god you know if you want to help the poor people or even the middle class
people you know avoid all of the the the the the the dependencies on the modern you know interfere in
healthcare system then we need as a foundation nutritionally dense food you know and I'm kind
of I've got over my frustration and anger at it all over the last few years but it makes me cringe
a little bit you know so I'm hoping I've given a kind of summary to some of Western A prices
discoveries kind of describing as best as I can a little a little sneak peek into into what it
might mean what does a healthy person look like what are the the physical attributes the body
characteristics that that you there might be able to distinguish and give you an indication for
the kind of food you've had and you know even if you have a bad body shape it's it's still beneficial
to start eating nutritionally dense nutrient dense foods because you know not only during those
you know I think it's said every seven years our body all the cells in our body are completely
replaced so it's not like our bodies are grown during childhood and adolescence and early youth
and then you know we stop needing any nutritional nutritional food to to keep us strong and healthy
the those requirements continue you know and even in old age maybe they're actually higher or
through perhaps menstruation and and if you want to avoid osteoporosis osteo I think it's all
osteoporosis the the weakening of the bones especially in females in women then then we need
to eat the correct foods you know and perhaps if you I know it's it's it's more complicated in the
US because of the the private health system and the the cost of some of these procedures or
helps that they give you and maybe especially for you people it is actually more cost effective
to to reconsider what you're eating now as the instead of you know saving up to pay for some
medical health system and scheme for your for your later years you know I personally don't
subscribe to any kind of health system I had to go to the the doctors a few years ago because I
broken arm I got kicked by a horse very hard but until that point I hadn't been to the doctors
or anything and I had trouble even believing that I broke on my arm to be honest but maybe that's
a separate story and and all of these things that I'm not saying that I'm the the most healthy
I have other problems connected with with stress you know tension and more have you because
it can be stressful trying to manage all of these things and raising young children and what
have you you know it's a challenge but I hope this has been interesting and I would very much like
to do a follow-up episode and it would help me a great deal if if you've got any comments or if
you'd like me to try and clarify and I think but once again the book is called Trishon
and Physical Degeneration a comparison of primitive and modern diets and their effects and of
course you can find that at amazon or maybe it might be mentioned on my podcast blog which is
Doodman or V.C. Z and another great book which I should just mention as well is Sally Fallon's book
Navishin Traditions and the subtitle is the cookbook that challenges politically correct nutrition
and the diet diet dictocrats and my wife is actually in the middle she's almost halfway through
translating this book it's over 700 pages it has fascinating kind of sidebars the edges of each
page during the end of the book and the middle parts are lots and lots of traditional healthy
recipes and so it's an amazing cookbook with sort of related historical anecdotes supporting
the recipes and sort of little tippits you would never imagine were possible and the first
quarter of the book describes all of the function of this nutrition it sort of justifies and explains
all of these food types and why we should eat them it's a fascinating book and I would highly
recommend getting it and if you speak the Czech language just wait until the spring and my wife
will have it all ready and we're going to try and self publish that so I'm sure nobody here is
Czech so that has no effect at all anyway I would like to thank you for listening it's been almost
an hour now and I and I really should finish so once again thank you very much for listening
