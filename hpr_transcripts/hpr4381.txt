What's not real is not real and the opposite of real is virtual.
This disclaimer, this script was written on an old book, I mean paper and pencil.
Problems, infinite fits, notifications, method of no problem, not engaging in everything
available, not with what the automatic recommendations give, ignore them, talking to whom you want
to talk.
Searching for what you are thinking mind wants to know, discover or be informed manually,
mindfully.
Choose to communicate one-on-one to know of someone instead of getting updated of your
friend by public posts.
No problem, we are tackling with these methods, lack of minimal, lack of meaningful interaction
because we are used to getting everything behind a little screen, by googling, by texting,
by rolling, stone, defeating, and another real problem, the brain rotting.
And brain rot was the word of the year for 2014, sorry for 2024.
We don't have studies on this, what methodology could be used to assess such implications.
It would be strange to know how to get to know the causes of something too big in the
lifestyle, but, and however, there is possibly a not welcome outcome of not having silence
and concentration, I will repeat the same thing, there is possibly a not welcome outcome
of not having silence and concentration.
And we know it as a smaller term, small time, but also in a larger time, like for long years.
Nobody today waits someone to come at the appointed time, everyone does something, and
these are her smartphone, and this might not be so innocent as an effect of our minds,
but again, we don't have studies and methodology would have to be studied to know causes and factors
effectively, if some student researcher wants to know that.
Examples that I wanted to put here, we have numbers and all of these examples.
We have links to the news, to the information in the notes.
We have morals, hinders, and tendons to have morals, hinders, disease across the next
years, mainly attributed to age, which can be a factor of course.
And what about not age, but lifestyle, life habits?
Not only to a factor, we have studies that show that physical activity, yes, simple physical
activity, which is contrary to technology and the necessity addiction, because technology
is mainly what we do sedentarily without activity, but physical activity reduces the
chance of getting Alzheimer's, and even those who end up having, because it's also genetical,
even they have less symptoms and less decrease in mental abilities.
In Sweden, another example, they went from digital to paper, not the other way around,
but from digital to paper, starting now in 2023, as a school minister, Lota Eldom, has
talked to the Guidedan, using the notes.
You don't have a good outcome of having only digital, so you then went to that grand
scheme of things in 2009, and 15 years later, like 2023, 2023, 2024, and from now on,
they are reducing the changes of paper books to digital, going back to paper, texts, and
etc. One factor, one thing they noted, is their decrease in score of the international
reading literacy exam, that Sweden continues great, but it has reduced it's score from
10 years ago, so they attribute it in part, because of the excess of digital.
There is also a link that I want to put to you, that is from teaching across borders,
and the theme is the Brazilian classroom, same, same, but very different, it's from September
2012 to 2022, and it says in part of the last paragraph, at one high school, the graffiti
called decorated desks, are have hazardly placed around the room, the near constant
chatter of the students can be heard throughout the lecture, an occasion of students can
be seen taking notes, others pass the time on their phones, or even openly sleep in
their desks, teachers here typically limit the instruction to 20 minutes, along with students
free time, for the remainder of the 50 minute class, the teacher explains that the students
are unable to retain all of the information, and they are not accustomed to the concentrating
far that long, and the paragraph continues until the end, and Brazil also has an initiative
about digital in its course, and since 2025 this year, Brazil has a national, law-on-nation
void law, that no cell phones are allowed on classroom, do you imagine, can you imagine any
children, any adolescents, any teenager at school, being the basic education from 6 to 17 years,
that is the basic education from the infancy to the youthness, they can choose cell phones or
even portal, even have their smartphones with them, they have to put in wider each school,
assigns them to do, and can't get it on their classrooms, that's a big change, and it's having
mixed results in satisfaction of the students, but in concentration and satisfaction of teachers,
it's going a long way, and thus this program tries to opinionate, that's certainly good
for the overall thinking, one example I heard in a famous podcast here in Brazil, I think the most
least in one, it's called Oasonto, would be the subject, one was a testimony, a researcher said
that when the student had not this smartphone at school, they thought wow, they would come home,
and want to tackle to smartphone, to get it, and having profits of the last time, to recover the
last time, but instead they saw the researchers, the male researcher is a woman,
so that the students could now instead read at home, because the dopamine or what anything that
the brain and habits have formed all these years of having cell phones, all the time with him,
being ours without it, means that when at home he was not on that height of digital, he could
pick a book to read, he could have a silent time with his mind, instead of relying on the
continuous, then normally we have as continuous, this smartphone, or the digital,
may it talk to you, be you a hacker in the strict sense of the word or not, but listening to this
hacker public radio program, to, to special it, to see how we are doing, how we are doing
in terms of real relations, real researches, real living, because no, online meeting is not a
meeting of persons, it's a communicate means yes, communication means, but anywhere near or what
can be called a meeting, let's call the things are, as they are, what's behind the screen,
what is mediated by technologies, is perfect as something done by the use of technologies,
but it's not a replacement of the real thing, and we can't call it as if it is, thank you,
and one was here with you, talking about from digital to paper, from automatic to mind,
mindly, mindfulness, if you want to call this way, without the philosophical meanings of all
they call this, and relying on real, because what's not real, is not real, and the opposite of real
is virtual, bye bye
and our syncs.net
