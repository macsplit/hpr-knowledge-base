So it's not dead, but I like the 3.5 version and the other reason is, you know, the overhead of the cute libraries and stuff
But I want to head and start it because it uses it actually uses, you know, less resources than does ice weasel
But the main reason I started is the fish protocol. It makes
Working with remote directories
super easy in a tabbed environment and you know, you need SSHFS, you need fuse and then you know
There's ways to do this from a command line. There's ways to
Demount directories remotely and access them from any webbrow. I mean, it's excuse me any fire manager
I may not command or email them to whatever, but I like the way conqueror does it. It's just
It's it's just better
And I've got this space. So I figured I'm not really gonna start anything else on here. So conqueror's not hurting anything
What else
Well, excuse me. I can't leave this on that. I or SSI which I think I've already mentioned pigeon
Deluge the bit-toint client. I may be repeating myself. So I'm not not sure
What else?
That that may be about yet
You know some of some of this came with with some stuff. I mean like yeah like that then start Pysol
In and of installing Pyseline. So I've got that
uh
Various that package handling utilities their boar fin stuff like that the alternatives can figure it's already mentioned
That that's more or less it rock spoiler. I think I mentioned a screen tuner of mentioned
That's it. I'm really happy with this
It's not as lightweight as it was and everything on here's lightweight
I think the the two fattest applications. I have a conqueror in
Osweasle, but I have lightweight alternatives with links
I've already mentioned the three applications that I had intended to talk about this episode which were conqueror gftp and
Files it or that's that's three
Graphical ways that come to mind to me to browse remote directories
Like I said, you can use any file manager if you have sshfs or fuse installed to
The mount and view and manipulate remote file systems graphically. You can do it from the command line to of course, but graphically
You know, there they're not a lot of file managers that
That handle that as good as conqueror does not know. I know gnomes gotten it, you know with the the gvfs
But you know, I'm not a big novelist fan even though they have tabs now. Uh, I just like the way conqueror does it better
I
Like I said, you know, you can use your favorite file manager if you're already mounted with sshfsfs
Deposits and you use emlf and to whatever
But g, you know for a long time, I you know, they work. I have to use putty and
Occasionally I use win scp. It's a win this application that allows you to
do scp through a graphical environment
And so it's a win is only application, but the only two really equivalent Linux applications are gftp
And phyllo and phyllo is cross-platform
So I guess off the three phyllo gftp and win scp phyllo is only truly cross-platform
graphical way of
the ssh
Minute, you know viewing and doing stuff with remote file systems
Anyway, I'm beginning to ramble this. This wasn't the most well planned out episode. I apologize
The holidays and work have been
Almost more than I can handle, so I've been pretty busy
Anyway, so there it is for what is worth my episode of hacker putty radio
Be sure to try to check out the colon show tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern time. All right until next time on hacker putty radio
