From the south shores of Lake Irian ash to be accounting, this is another episode of hacker public radio.
This episode is recorded on Monday, September 3, 2012.
One thing the contemporary hacker needs to worry about is resilience in the face of natural disasters.
As this is recorded, the last remnants of the cyclone named Isaac are winding up their existence.
This is the time of year otherwise termed as the height of hurricane season.
A few weeks prior the eastern seaboard of the United States was faced with the Dorecho, which is a fancy term for a storm with damaging straight line winds.
What happens when the network of networks popularly called the internet goes away? This is not an abstract question.
Beyond those malevolent human beings and non malevolent human beings who can create collapses,
the power of natural events is often forgotten due to its unpredictability.
In terms of network design, the inner gambler has shown us chances are taken as the severe event never happening.
In the United States, the lights will go out. It is merely matter when.
And everything will be on the scale of the northeastern block out of 2003 or the destruction associated with Hurricane Katrina.
Sometimes things will be local. Heck, even a surprise appearance by President Obama on Reddit for an Ask Me Anything session took that site down for a while.
The architecture of the internet is great for storing forward communications.
An easy example of that is this very program you are listening to.
Aside from webmail access, email works much the same way.
This isn't the case for the class of people who have cut the cord and taken down any television aerials so that they rely solely on internet streaming from sites like Hulu.
Streaming is problematic. A constant connection is presumed.
Nowhere along the way can that connection fail, where the content being consumed is likely to suffer in its presentation.
Buffering can help to an extent during normal network operation.
The buffering of a Netflix stream at the highest imaginable latency is when you get what you are watching, not from an internet attached device, but by way of a physical piece of media that you receive in the mail.
There is a pertinent quote that is sometimes attributed to Dennis Richie.
That quote simply states, never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes.
As I've stated elsewhere, programs like this are licensed under Creative Commons attributions share like license.
At your looking productions, we shifted to using that license going forward once the Arab Spring kicked off in 2011.
Under this license, you are fully free to go ahead and redistribute materials bearing the license.
Reform adding such programs to being simple audio tracks and burnt audio compact discs, or lining such programs out to conventional cassette tape, is not just possible, but encouraged.
Beyond hacker public radio, things like free speech radio news, rat hole radio, Linux outlaws, and programs on leo-leports.twit.tv network can be similarly reformatted.
Physical media is not dead. Creative Commons is not being leveraged to its fullest either, though.
Now is the time to consider how to hack together a solution to prove sharing without using computers.
Shared listening sessions help increase the reach of programs and ensure others can tune in for shared experience.
Sharing audio cassettes labeled in a compliant fashion works too.
Heck, scheduling rooms at community centers and public libraries can allow for group experiences, though popcorn might be questionable for eating there.
For example, a decent project would revolve around using a vehicle board with LCD attachment to build a portable playing unit to listen as a group.
The tech is there. A bunch of somewhat there provided you do an install, and you can build an audio hardware of choice.
The connecting glue of integration is what is missing.
Depending upon national licensing regime, license-free broadcasting over a short range is possible.
Combining a legal transmitter with software on an old system, and running utilities like Rivendell, a full broadcast day of Creative Commons programming could be released.
You could share your favorite programs to the rest of your neighborhood, where the only barrier is having a suitable AMFM receiver, and making it at the appropriate time to catch the re-broadcast.
Another thing to consider would be leaving copies of Creative Commons license programs, or so-called pardon me, free music scene magazines are kept.
Podcasts are but spoken word magazine issues in many cases.
Leaving cheap audio disks, bearing compliant labels within cheap, paper sleeves would increase access.
Because sets may be harder to deploy for use, local cultural conditions will control in any case.
Read the Creative Commons licenses, think of alternative ways to consume content bearing such licenses.
You'll never know when your access to the internet will go away.
If you're storing forward communications of rich content, you'll still have something available, even if your access becomes intermittent.
To close, we must note a story that arose during the preparation of this program.
A local internet service provider lost its backhaul when a copper thief climbed a pole somewhere between Cleveland, home to the rock and roll hall of fame, and Geneva, the northwestern most city in Asheville County, to try to cut down wire.
This is a rising trend where copper from public utilities is stolen and sold to scrap metal dealers, so as to make a profit that might be spent on, for example, illegal narcotics.
The impacted internet service provider lost access to the backbone, operated by first energy corporation.
The thief got some fiber optic cable that they can't really sell, and users of that internet service provider got a 15 hour outage during Labor Day weekend.
Yeah, how do you predict that one happening?
As economic times continue to stay in lousy condition, threats to access continue to exist.
Bad governments engaging in censorship are not our only worry.
Old-fashioned interference previously termed backhoe interference for the tearing up of buried lines using backhoe equipment remains a bigger danger.
Are you prepared?
