Hello hacker public radio fans, this is EEZ once again with another episode.
This one is going to be really short.
It's just in response to Dave Morris' recent episode that I came out today, which is
Wednesday the 26th of February 2018 and it's about this little bash script that he wrote.
I say little but it is quite it's fully featured and well documented and has really good
best practices on how to write a bash script. But anyway I wouldn't expect anything else from Dave.
But what I wanted to talk about today just really briefly is how I just use the script
in a couple of minutes after inspecting it and looking out it worked.
I tried it out and I'm like oh that's pretty cool and I noticed what I had plugged in in my
house right now out of the six or seven that I own. I only have four plugged in and three of them
were Raspberry Pi 3's one is Raspberry Pi 2 and the three Raspberry Pi 3's they all worked with
the command just fine. But the Raspberry Pi 2 it's my oldest one that I still am using and I've
messed around with a lot so I don't know if I either deleted the VC GN-G-N-C-M-D command which is
the little utility that goes on the pies as a way to if you look in the script that he made it's
the real workers horse of the script it's the thing that is looking at all the able to look at all the
different pieces of information on the device and output them and for whatever reason I when I
ran the command on one of my on the Raspberry Pi 2 it said command not found I found a an article
about it and the other thing that's a little weird is I it's the only one that is running
Raspbian the other three are running of 1 2 6 0 4 but after looking around on line for a little bit
I found a form a Raspberry Pi form about what to do if it's not installed and
and I'm going to put a link to that in the in the show notes as well as the link inside the link
which basically what it says to do is oh here there's a GitHub repo where you can download
the source for this this program and then build it on the pie or you can build it off the
pie and cross compile which I didn't feel like knowing so I just record just went right onto
the pie and it doesn't matter if it takes a half hour I can just let it run and come back later
and I don't know how long it took because like I said I just let it run it came back later but
but yeah you just have to go and and get pull it and then CD into the directory and build it
and make sure you have CMake installed but yeah once once I did that I said well let me think
about this a little bit I can either there's a few ways I like to automate tools like this one of
them is using Ansible and I think I might have talked about Ansible before but it's a tool developed
by I think now it's developed by right now I don't know if it originally was and it's a way to
to do automation and it's it's agentless so unlike some other applications it's agentless
and on and you don't need to anything installed except for SSH and I'll use Fabric which is
for for similar reason because all you need is SSH but in the meantime before I started to do
anything crazy or anything fancy I just made a simple for loop and I have I know the host names
are those for Raspberry Pi so I just said in pseudo code it goes like this for Pi in this list of
Raspberry Pi host names I want to cat the what Pi file and then I want to pipe the output of the cat
which is you know the the details of file into SSH and then do a bash do a bash command of
the standard out which is that file name on every one of those on every one of those host so what
ends up happening is one by one I get a screen full of information about that Raspberry Pi
and if I wanted to I could redirect the output of that and so a text file just so I'll have it
so that's what I did all right now I'll also put that one liner in my show notes
just to show how I used it and but I think this is what hacker public radio is all about
it's about a community of people who like to tinker and mess around with things sharing their
experiences and then every once in a while you find one of those gems that really connects with
you and you you try it out yourself and it works for you and it makes you smile sometimes it can
be something simple and just get something accomplished for a personal project sometimes
it can at least for me turn into a big idea that I have for my company or way to I can market
my my services in a way that I didn't have before but a lot of times like I said it's just
you know doing something fun and and learning more about hobbies that interest you
so that's it for this episode stay tuned for more episodes of hacker public radio once again
I invite all listeners to record this an episode just like I am right now one note about this
recording if it sounds different than previous recordings I'm doing this on purpose to show how
easy it is I just right now looked for a random video audio recorder on my phone Android phone
installed it and started recording this episode and so within five minutes you can start
recording an episode for hacker public radio that's all easy it is now I just have to go and save
this file I'll probably move it to my computer and then just go to hacker public radio but I only
think I need to do that I'm pretty sure if I just went to hacker public radios website on my phone
I should be able to just do it straight from there actually I'm going to try that that will be my
mission for today I want to do this all just from my phone to show how easy it is so thank you once
