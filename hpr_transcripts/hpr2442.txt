Hello, I can public regular listeners, this is Tony Hughes in Blackpool in the UK again.
A few months ago, John Colp released in episode 254,
Night Sounds in Roller, Tennessee and it reminded me that I recorded some sounds in Birmingham in the UK
when I was staying in residential Quaker Study Center in April.
And I said I might release them as a show and I decided to release them now.
So the next 14-15 minutes or so is the recording I made in 1st week of April.
Woodbrook Quaker Study Center in Birmingham.
So enjoy them.
Thank you very much and I'll see you again soon.
