Hi everybody my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of HPR Public Radio.
Today there are two utilities that I wanted to bring you to your attention and before I get
myself in trouble with myself there are two very related utilities so therefore that's why I'm
doing them together. The first one is called Simple Screen Recorder. It's by Martin Barrett.
Martin Barrett.BE for such simple screen recorder and what it does is record your screen. When
you start it up you get a welcome screen you press continue you can select what you want to record,
what audio you want to record, then you go to the next screen you can select the type MKV MP3
og webm whatever and the audio codec you want to use you press continue again then this button
start recording and that's it to record your screen very very simple when you're finished you press
save recording and that's it done your video will have appeared in your home videos folder wherever
you choose to record it so that's simple enough too depending on your desktop I use LXQT
and therefore I have more of these small simple unix like do one thing do it well type tools your
desktop may vary for that sort of recording but now you end up with a recording of your desktop and you
want to you're happy enough with the container format but you just want to chop the bit at the front
and the bit at the end of where you're pressing pause and whatever you might also want to
I don't know cut out bits in the middle and stuff like that so you're not actually video editing
a search you're not doing transitions you're just chopping up a piece of video and for that I had
a little look around and there is an excellent tool called Vid cutter and it's on github.com
as martin vid cutter and it is available for arch debi and fedora make into open suzi and
Ubuntu windows and mac users as well brew and it uses I think
vid cutter so if you open up the log if you open up configuration somewhere the tools it uses
is ff mpag ff probe and media and for all three of my all-time favorite video tools you're
basically greeted with a a screen that shows you the video on the bottom like a your classic
video track you press open media and you import the video that you want to chop you move forward
the time frame to where you want to start chopping you can press the open down arrow keys on
either the milliseconds seconds or hours minutes whatever and you can you can jump one second if
you're the one second thing one minute if you're in the one minute area it gives you an idea of
the frames and then you press start of clip and then you move to the end and you press end of clip
and you can continue to do enough for several different ones and it will add them as chapters
on the right hand side and when you're done there's basically one button and it's called save
media and when you do that it'll chop it to the nearest eye frame modify the video itself and
truncate those those frames for you assembling it together as one simple video really really simple
I like it I like the UI it's really really handy and I've used it several times for bits and pieces
that I've needed to do in the last few days just where you take a video and I wanted to
something happens and this is a long transition where nothing is happening then something happens
so you can make a compilation video real quick and take the audio out because you just want to show
somebody this event is occurring frequently over time and because you have the ability to do
just take a video and chop it up this fast it's really it's really to the level of being simple text
editor type function but then for videos that's how simple it is so links to all of these will be
in the show notes it's called vid cutter and the other one then is a simple screen recorder
