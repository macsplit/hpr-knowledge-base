I don't want to say a little bit about poets.
Okay.
Okay, I'll let you write down below that everything at home or operate everything to the new
Ubuntu.
Okay, I did one fresh install and one upgrade will work pretty flawlessly, because my XPS
laptop does have a few little keyboard issues itself because the hotkeys running VMs and
stuff like that, but rather than that that works just fine, I'll also put on a new VM where
there's a 25 workstation, and it's got that Unity view, which is really cool, I like that
and that's worth the contest, so I'll mix your Windows program over like an open office
and it looks like it's right here, you're in the office.
How about the unit that installs, that it's graphic, that's right over now, yeah, if you
just got the security, you just have to go to command line to exit here, and if you have
to do something that's common, you work actually pretty good, because when I did install
it, I just ran the icon, and it actually pulled up the way, you said all I had to pile
yours, so did the compiling and the way, and the other thing that they had was the network
for turning out the way, which is handy, but it always has been working pretty good.
What did they call that mode again, is Unity, Unity says that you serve works in office,
it works in office, I don't know, there's a name, there's a box similar thing, but it
becomes the desktop background, layout, depending on which way you have to do it.
This one, why don't you get in the full windows, I'm going to resize the queue, perfect,
I'm going to rotate it, and then the start menu appears, you can put it in any corner
or any place, normally it starts where you're going to find it, so if you just move your
cursor up there, you'll drop down, so you can see your start menu, for maybe a lot of
those, and you can select everything on that, it's not going to work, I thought it worked
really well, I did have to do a reboot, they don't tell you to do a reboot, but if I did
do a reboot, I could sort of let's play it like that, but after every reboot everything
came up, the work can be fine, I think.
No, that's it, that's it, that's all it all, no, no, no, no, no, I'm glad, you know,
even the old engine, I'm glad you're a priority, that's great, when you're here at the
crackball and I was joining this team, you know, I think it's fine.
One day, as long as the temperature's above 50, how would I keep going?
No, it was like 5.
Was it?
Oh, you know what I'm saying?
I think he has, because he's got, he's going to have low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
Low speed.
You've been pretty good last Friday, I decided I was going to put a shelf up in the garage
and Sunday, I finished up insulating the wall that I'm going to put a shelf up.
So, I'm just making up with up the sheet or I don't think it's going to work.
Hopefully, I'll be starting that shelf.
So, so you take it, just, just right around.
Yeah, you know, it's very, you know, it's pretty shelf.
That's it.
I'm not going to do that, it's like the wall.
So, I'm not going to do that in the future, I'm not going to say it.
No, I really don't want to have to just, you know, take your back, insulation,
that's not there, but something back to you all.
So, I've got some sheet rocks.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I was about to do a three-week project.
No, the sheet rocks, I'm going to look really nice, I'm going to be before you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just going to rope you in there.
That's right.
I don't have to buy a sheet.
I don't have to buy a sheet.
Other ones, I don't have to buy a sheet.
I don't have to buy my car, I don't have to.
It's cost-effective.
I used to.
Well, you know, you have a house, you can live always something to do.
Cool.
I was just telling you.
What?
I was the short way from work to be here.
It's good.
It actually takes me about the same time.
It gets a few years, a few years, a week.
So, it goes there a couple of years, a few years.
So, it goes there a couple of years.
And it's a couple of years, a couple of years, a couple of years.
But, if you realize what the employees actually have, it should all be on us.
It should all be on us.
Yeah, it was never really a radio station.
Yeah.
It was never really a radio station.
Yeah.
Are they going to leave the new ramp or anything, or is that still a patient?
Oh, three levels are only for the patients.
The fourth level is for employees, but it's going by seniority.
So, I know the doctors have their own little car.
Yeah, they car.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
So, the doctors and their law, nothing that actually went up in the ramp.
And a couple of people, the lab, that have been there in like 30 years,
and they actually have parking passes for the man.
So, if you were just hired there, you would suspend your car.
Yeah.
Make sure the show works pretty nice.
Especially when you get to work in 6th grade already.
Yeah, I can go.
I'll make sure they get up.
They should work a bunch.
They're using the gas station.
They're using the gas station.
You have to have a store place.
It's by the police gear hard.
Is it good part of that?
Yeah, it's around the principal gear hard.
Yes.
Other than that, it's just that it's 8.
It's that 8.
What?
Black, right?
Oh, the white!
What is that?
What does 8?
8.
7.
8.
You should have made it up and I'm going to put like 90s straight out of stuff.
Stop!
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
I'm going to install the...
They were copying what color田 did you want...
They brought what color are they the...?
They forgot to produce them?
What do you think?
Let's get a ruler...
Guys, I want him to scout trouble.
Okay, here's the九 uh cream oportuner train.
What program they're suits you for?
What type of flowers that she wanted to have?
I have no idea.
Let's take this out in here.
Well, it looks some normal wooden country.
I think that she lost that...
I'm glad you guys are known to install a new...
That will work, one thing is an dawn.
You gens walk off to the apartment like this.
So the whole blackboard is going to be right here, just to be around here open here.
Get on over.
I don't think they've ever had, but I don't know.
I?
My head says something else.
Oh, come on.
Can we talk to someone?
Yeah.
Okay.
Right now, what are just going to be?
No.
The West Gate is on the 12th.
You walk in there so you can face the nominers.
We did a prayer for the eyes, but no.
We did a prayer for the eyes, but no.
So it looks like it's right above the lobsters.
Yeah, it's awesome location.
It's a hunting club.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a local festival.
It's a local activity.
There's a lot of top-race, you know, it's a section.
There's a few countries.
Yeah.
It's cheap.
It's cheap.
It's cheap.
It's nice.
It's not.
It rents me a Japanese suit.
It's not my own home.
It's my own club.
It's cool.
It used to rent.
Yeah.
What did I do?
I installed a book, too.
I didn't do it.
I learned because I never tried partitions.
That's by the way, now that I know we could try to get it,
and always like it, or just like that whole stuff.
Before I wanted to go out with them, and I just, I,
so I just made it solid.
It was pretty good.
I mean, if yours could be working,
or if everything is fine, then I'm not going to worry.
But do a good job of, you know, keeping up with this stuff.
We're running a whole new release out,
and keeping the folks out of it.
You're free of the buy-in, and to say,
I'm a part of the world, and you're a part of it.
You're a part of it.
You're a part of it, too.
I'm a part of it.
You're a part of it.
You're a part of it, and you're a part of it.
You're a part of it.
You're a part of it.
And I say, you know there, they're blocked.
There's a different company to play.
I think now I That's the Cale Games.
How much did I do all day this?
My bro, something since clav Woo.
What've he grown up at this time?
Well, in that care I had use the ahml and I threw out red nil.
And I did taste the brown nail.
And that made some hard work right now from I chain.
And I think that it's going to taste pretty good.
Like it's not brown?
It's not brown.
And I think it's probably brown though.
It's going to be better than the very last one.
It's not pretty.
But it's still very good.
It's not pretty happy about that.
It's just good as the Smith Winks.
I never got it.
You never got it.
Did you guys do the ingredients?
No, I didn't.
It's yummy.
I don't buy a fine one here.
I think that's perfect.
Well, the list is totally the same.
It was like too late.
Too late?
So what do you tell me?
I tell you.
No one.
Well, it's not like you've got a sip of gas.
No, no.
No, no.
Apparently I was okay.
It wasn't very carbonated.
Yeah, it was not.
I think that's just stuff like sugar close.
It was supposed to be there.
I think that was part of the case, too.
That's the wrong thing.
Part of it wasn't up to it.
So, but then it was a deposit.
I just don't like it.
Part of it.
It was on frills.
Yeah, it was okay.
It's okay.
But...
I've been doing that for a while.
It's connecting temporarily with no...
No, I didn't actually.
Yeah.
All of you had to do that.
What I'm doing right now.
I'm seeing if I can produce the speed in my wireless card.
It keeps trying to connect it to that speed.
I figured if I could create it all the way down.
I might be able to do a good connection.
Yeah.
Is that a good thing?
Yeah.
Is that a good thing?
Good thing.
This isn't the final version.
But it was very good.
Better read it with the...
Well, that's cool.
It's really nice and modest in the background.
Yeah.
It's a lot better with the higher quality.
That's just a great compliment.
Well, resolution.
It doesn't look very like a digital artist.
But it looks like crap.
Okay.
I'm just saying, for resistance, it looks fine.
But when you actually look at it, you can barely even read the letter because it's...
Full resolution.
The card in yourself.
Yeah.
What are we going to do if we are going to have the internet connectivity?
It will be in Weird тайger or something.
We're going to Eat This.
We're going toati, Unsuitable container.
They make a delivery in and out.
And today, whatła we'll call out in a glance.
So...
we've just run across our road.
I'm sure one of those health extent can outiley write the Happy Card international scene.
So we have to do a local tour.
Everything's going to be worth it.
We're the road.
I guess it is probably grown, so we are technically all our owners of the world.
That would be a sin.
But the world doesn't have internet connection, so that's a number of the neighbors being across the world.
I also tend to get the dogs back here, they'll fuck you.
And how old are you?
Disrupted.
I've already spent a few minutes and I think so.
I don't know how old you are.
I don't really use too much of savings.
Why do you...
We have these six called kids.
What do they take a lot of time?
It's probably about a hundred or more.
A lot of maintenance.
What's that fucking up for, too?
Yeah, so I'm not too excited on the outside of here.
True, that's fine, yeah.
So what do you do with Javi, for a long time?
We call it just how big torrents work.
Probably everything you get started was kind of a question.
They don't understand what I'm saying.
They have to be seated.
Someone creates a torrent file on the server.
And then you have...
The entire space doesn't make more than an informational site.
Yeah, it's a torrent tracker is what it's called.
And it tracks, it keeps up to date information on all the torrents that it's keeping track.
It's a directory.
Yeah, that's a problem.
It's a problem, very much.
I find below the exact size.
They did just...
Somebody said it just made a big torrent.
It's truly non-central.
They'll just exit the site right back.
It is one...
There will be a central...
How do you get started?
You can add the one box and then add this stuff for other boxes.
And then add it for some other boxes.
And just...
And they'll branch the other ones, the other ones, the other ones.
If you have the other ones, then...
Has anyone heard about the new file sharing service that's supposed to be similar to like...
...Rapid share or mega upload?
Like similar to like a low cost, like a drop box.
But it...
What it does is creates a torrent file for you.
And it allows you to transfer to distributed torrents to your friends.
And I think it's free.
There was some...
That you actually upload files for a server.
And then they said...
...FDP, they said e-mail to somebody.
Well, let you do that.
It would be...
Or whatever it was.
Let me just let you...
You have a torrent.
Then it's not...
This wasn't...
This was supposed to be a combination of what you were talking about and...
...like Bitcoin.
Like basically a central location pre-distribute your BitTorrents.
Okay.
Okay.
You want to hear the original?
We've lost either...
...sure.
Hmm.
Let's see what it does now.
Quick.
You're welcome.
It's the...
The other side.
I'm just...
Get the tongue.
I just...
This looks for sure.
I'm gonna write that.
So I'll write it.
I'm not rich.
You need your heart?
I need your heart.
I'm not rich.
I'm not rich.
There's no color.
I don't think I'm rich.
Okay.
I think you're so rich.
Well, yeah.
Of course, I'm rich.
I'm not rich.
I'm a never-of-oost-eyed, dude.
I am.
I'm not rich at all.
I've heard that...
Wait, I didn't see that.
I didn't see what it does.
The makes of the black background.
No.
That wasn't working on it.
I was looking.
I was looking here.
So what...
So what are they gonna do with that?
Like, I don't want to...
It's green hour hours.
I'm looking at the lights.
I'm looking at the lights.
It's putting all that attention on the...
It's putting all that attention on the...
It's putting all that attention on the...
Green, green, red, red...
Green, green, red, red...
I have a question.
It's trying...
All the sews...
We said we...
They tried that.
They wanted to see...
They did it.
I did.
but I just… I don't know if you've been...?
What do I like when you do?
And…you know I have a few failed looselling…
So I wonder if we have 7 or 6 descent from you guys.
I just do it all the time, so I'm just doing this work.
Well, I have a issue with it that I got back from 18, it has the gas plot stuff.
But, yes, it's not that much different than the Ubuntu.
All of the Ubuntu stuff is native-known.
No, it's configuration. It's not Ubuntu's invention, right?
It's a standard, basically. It's a standard.
Whereas, yes, this overlap is redo of stuff that's already there
and don't use the stuff that's there because the gas will overwrite it anyway.
It'll go as low, right?
It'll go massive.
Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah.
I keep trying the light as soon as it's in every time it comes out of the same problem.
I want to go to the GNOME tool that configured my networking cars,
or what they changed it.
I use it as better and...
It either doesn't work, or the next time, yes, does something that removes what I've done,
or whatever, you know.
I think if you're not familiar with the distribution at all, maybe it's fine.
Yeah.
And then you'll be used to you as soon as you use it.
I don't think that that's what it is, you know.
The guy who asked me actually tried the Ubuntu is that,
while after a few hours, I got bored with it, I had to go back
and I could tell him the same thing.
I've used the Ubuntu, and I'm happy that this version works for me
or whatever I want to do, I don't have a problem so far.
So, just because they did beta right now,
and in previous release, I didn't touch that.
And they wanted to see my ex over 5, so I said,
my ex over 5, so I don't know.
That's what I always have problems with.
That NVIDIA cars, and sometimes they complain,
and it's a pain to get great resolution on this stuff.
So, because of the bottom-up, the live CD appeared to be,
and we've rooted that back in the theater to do what we find.
That's always ended up doing this on you.
I would happy that XOR saved the waste,
and then I could end it here, bring it up on there,
and it's where they cracked out, I would replace the XOR over that one.
At least the developers mentioned that.
The live CD.
Yes, live CD works, but after you installed it, yeah.
That's the kind of stuff that nobody's going to need.
No, there's no cross.
Once they run into that, one of the problems,
they're like, okay, the rest of, you know,
the installs can go just as bad, so I continue on.
Like, the one that I upgraded,
bringing my desktop,
I had to go into the same video,
and install a new version of it.
It came out of the right resolution,
but it didn't do it by default.
It makes me think that I played with Dream Linux for about five minutes.
It took me five minutes to get bored of it.
Is that the one of the live?
How's it like the Mac?
How's it all along?
Yeah, the thing is, you know, they tone it,
they make it simple.
I mean, based on everything that Ubuntu is trying to do,
they claim they've done,
and it's just not...
They said they put all the multimedia products on there,
and stuff like that.
It's fine that they're there,
but when I can't figure out how to do a certain configuration change,
you know, I'm like, yeah, it's...
I want to change my window address, say you're something,
and I found a little tool to do it,
and I'm clicking the button,
and hitting execute or fly,
and then I know it's a little fine print of above.
It says, oh, I need to do control all aspects left.
I mean, yeah, I know about that,
but nobody's going to think about Linux for the first time.
It's like, oh, sure.
Yeah.
I'm going to be like, what do you think is that?
If you got lucky, that is the name.
It was the name.
Yeah.
I mean, it looked okay, but it's...
Well, I tried green one of the Linux two times,
and I did that, I stole it.
My CD was okay, but then it stole it.
That was really funny.
My CD's worked well.
Yeah.
Was it their installer?
Was it their installer?
Because it did read something about the dream Linux they have.
They claimed the only installer that forced the dream Linux
to start over with a straight gen to install it.
The live gen to CD does.
Yeah.
What do we say?
I do pretty good.
Do we play every hour or so?
Actually, I've played with it once, you know,
I didn't take, honestly, that much longer than a regular
or less to install.
I just couldn't figure out how to get anything working
after I had it installed, because I didn't have any hardware stuff,
basically.
My monitor came up in some weird resolution,
and I kind of got to work with quite a listening game
about monitoring for about three hours.
I never started with it.
The monitor time you have to spend doing that?
Yeah.
Let somebody else do it.
That's why I come and got to you too,
is that whatever is the default, most likely, I'll use it.
And some people said, well, you can do X, Y, Z,
and say, I don't want to do X, Y, Z.
I want it as it would get the default.
Some people just wanted to work.
Yes.
That's right.
I mean, once you really know how computers work and stuff,
you think, like, why can't they just get the darn stuff to work?
Especially with Linux, you've got the same software, basically.
I think where it should go or whatever.
I always say it's the 90% rule.
Once they get the 90% working,
they'll wipe the slate and start over.
They get things to like 90%.
And then it seems like, oh, start over.
Time to do it.
That's what we all do here.
That's a very popular tool.
It's a conspiracy tool.
Can we have that working for all the graphics now?
Yeah.
I think so.
I think we got all the graphics work.
Yeah, they have graphics.
It just works.
It just works.
It just works.
Oh, I really write it.
It works too well.
There's some unique adventure that they want to build into it
that sort of breaks everything down the line.
You get, you know, they can't add some simple feature
without breaking the old stuff.
Today, I was actually reading an interview.
There is a book to, it's not really good to develop.
It's not even something about it.
It's like, the book is full of materials.
It's not a word.
It was an IRC.
And it was actually people with questions
that you would actually answer in questions.
And from one of our IRC, this is what I got actually.
Mutu Obalette.
It's about 218 employees,
which I believe ismiş this is how it is.
That people are asking, what do you do
once the most of Mko み?
Example say, people want most old inmates
and their I estimate.
You know it?
That's what he said.
He said that they hired actually a staff for a team of the artists.
So we were saying that he's not sure if it will show a nice release because they did actually assemble a team at the same level.
They all said, well it does start working so I'm going to get a chain for it if we're in that frame.
So, but they are working on graphics as far as graphic speed.
So this stuff should be all pretty, that nice shirt.
You know, only in one year task spent.
And what distribution is setting up the track.
And out of distribution, the distribution is my actual follow-up.
And we see it with this six months cycle.
People like it, I'm not.
What else is there?
Because I should very interesting stuff.
We're going to have a point right now.
There was a question.
What person from the curve of unity was saying that we do is not going to be getting up.
And Chuck Worth was saying, well, that's what a person is.
Priority went there.
But my priority went somewhere else.
And we had a lot of people working for us.
And we are working in XYZ projects.
And because what project does it have?
It has to be that I could not have come.
It doesn't do that.
It's got to work somewhere else.
So, that was interesting to me too.
But I think it's nice to get a higher branch with that.
We're saying east to work straight up.
Because I had a couple of outcomes I needed to solve in those xp2.
But I can just use those xp standard disks
and the windows xp disks with certain action in,
in order for it to actually work.
And then you had to have a serial a.k.a. driver for the OS
or if you want your building in to make it work.
They had done all the drivers and installed it to get it to work.
They had done all the building office and put it all on there.
So, that didn't see that, but someone that had to build it.
There, the other thing that xp doesn't work well
is because you are not going back to it.
Literally, you have to download the driver
to put it in during the installation.
So, my wife and so on.
That way, these things will literally just do that.
And by the way, we have a we have a hb
relationship for each other if we hold for 80 years right now.
It's stopped working with an xp.
One day, it just stopped working.
You're not going to get out of work.
It just doesn't work.
So, what you're trying to do is
you have to lock it on.
It's laying on it.
Okay.
So, it works with the item.
I had an hp as you were on.
The toner and it's not there, but it kicks mine.
So, I couldn't print it to a window.
But it likes to work just fine.
Because when you say tell about the day, once again.
Yes.
Yes.
Also, the window is actually doing something.
Checking their tool up.
Oh, yeah.
There are the drivers to do that.
The hp drivers will show your printer down.
If you're even close to me and out of ammo.
Well, you're out of people complaining about that.
And even some other preventive effects are going to that.
Whether it's smart cartridge into your patient.
So, if you're getting low, oh, union cartridge.
And like, for example, our printer, which is an hp,
if my black runs out, I can't print the color.
You know, because they just said I'm not going to print
because you were here with one cartridge.
And it's got the fuller color.
So, if I run out of magenta, it won't print.
Because I now recognize that one cartridge,
even if I run out of black and white, it won't print.
But if this won't be on that, because I had full cartridge.
Here, which is they were on the date.
Not what it saw, it's not the date.
Yeah.
So, it just goes into the date.
Not what you get.
Because they're thinking that your cartridge is actually dry.
You know, when you just seem to go buy new one.
What's the rest?
Yeah.
What are you waiting for?
They hate the fact that I bought
a similar cartridge in the maple cut auction site.
They want the exact same one.
But bottom off of them, you know,
is that down the auction?
It's like they're on the bottom of the new one.
It's important that they work.
And they work.
Yeah.
Because the only difference is that it was a key
on the back of the little cartridge.
Wow.
Well, I just took a cartridge that we refilled from a Lexmark
over the place over by the mall.
They're, you know, my festival.
The festival.
And the printer says it's empty.
I mean, it took it over.
I had my player,
which at some point stopped working
with my little ex.
And so, I think that's far drove me out of stuff
that I actually before added my player.
And right now it works.
I wanted to add to it.
There was, I don't know if there was some file format corrupted.
But when I reformatted my printer by my player,
it's right there.
My MP3 player?
Yes.
Okay.
Don't really even have a problem with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, is it real?
Or real?
Uh, I...
I don't know.
I...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it...
I thought MP3 player also...
Yeah.
Is it?
So, it's the same thing as well.
It's the same thing as just that it meets the Apple proprietary tracks.
You know, the music service they have.
I mean, that's really very close.
They got their own hardware.
They got their own DRM music library.
It should be down a little bit.
So, I'm strong.
It's their own...
I think they are MP3.
But they look like MP3s.
Yeah.
Okay.
Not the ones that you down a little bit like the Apple website.
Those aren't it.
One of the MP3s.
Yeah.
One of the MP3s.
Eight years up there.
Oh, yeah.
I know.
I had a time for eight years.
You're playing three files.
But it's DRM stuff.
But it's DRM stuff.
So, if you don't check in either like every three months or something like that, that's
a lot of time out because you aren't fulfilling your subscription and stuff.
There's multiple...
There's different ways you can do it.
So, the Apple is...
This...
I think this is...
Barbie, because of their Lindsey website and the little device itself is kind of...
They have about 70% of the download music market.
Because a lot of these...
What?
Because they probably got out there first.
And they got...
But they're actually nice MP3 players.
They're very well designed.
Yeah.
Very small stuff like that.
And then they type with their music service.
They make their money off the music service.
But they don't do anything more than these other MP3 players.
Well, they do.
They don't do stuff like that.
But they get a lot of their proprietary coaxes.
And they buy them.
They do.
They do.
They go smart.
They go smart.
They go smart multiple.
But I have one of these three players.
They don't go smart with one thing.
Well, when you have an iPod, you could listen to one podcast and bookmark.
That one will have another one.
You don't have to bookmark it.
You just stop listening to that.
You have to go somewhere else and bookmark.
Man, you have a audio book.
You don't have to work there.
You need to watch a video and stuff.
And it's...
Well, that's not what it means.
It does to go to your iPod.
You need to watch video.
They've got a nice, nice software.
It's like a Mac system and a small thing.
I mean, the Mac system is an all-in-case.
They control everything.
So you make a very well-designed, very well-behaved system.
And that's why they can't promise anything.
But again, it's their digital rights that took into it.
And that's what's got people working.
Realistically, there's nothing good there to admit.
On the outside.
No.
Okay.
I'm going to try to break into that.
On the outside of the building.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because they can't play them for a format that Apple puts out.
I mean, if you buy stuff while they're service,
you can't buy them on other players.
You could bring them on your PC, rip it all out and see...
I actually were heading with the Rockbots.
Rockbots.
Just replace them.
Yeah.
It's a replacement firmware for lots of them B3 players actually.
They have it on my Sansa.
Okay.
My Sansa B3 player plays AAC.
And I think before you also have a program that will take the Apple stuff
and simulate it burning it to a scene and bringing it back into a B3.
You just don't have to get to that burning stuff.
It's right about all of them.
It's going to be quality.
You probably have this chance.
Oh, no.
There was an article of that.
It's actually a newsletter.
It's not going to be for all of you.
For all of you.
For all of you.
For all of you.
For all of you.
For all of you.
Yeah.
That's the way it is.
Somebody's working here basically.
You know, they still can't believe they think they can protect something
when the precautions in your own are also, you know, you get the player
that's got to hold the catch something.
You can't frame that.
As long as you can run hands, if they buy a strip,
there's very waste of right.
And that's how they did it.
That's what the articles did.
That's how they did this ones.
They formulated the hardware, the physical hardware that the blue rate player is.
That's how they rolled it.
So, you're buying it, I mean, it's like, why would you have to be a buy multiple times?
I read a letter on blog the other day about trying to get something published on a blue
ray and it's ridiculous.
Any kind of publisher house that publishes blue ray now has to have a copyright office
on the site because anything published over a blue ray with the official blue ray logo
or whatever, you have to pay for their proprietary anti or anti copy or their copy protection
software and no matter how many disks you buy, it's a flat rate of like $1,700, so by
a sense of race, there's no way around it, you can't have anything published without
paying for it.
But you know what, master, the twinkle of all the blue ray is going down really fast because
the blue ray is not like that on the media or by a hard drive, you get a high definition
step from somewhere else, so it's the purpose of it.
And there are two people I think who might have been that hard for me, the other guy says,
you know, if I really compare my blue ray with my ID, I really can't see the difference
in most cases.
So why would I pay twice as much for blue ray, he needs a bigger ID, or a sick closer,
you can see a difference in IDF TV versus a DVD, but I also have to pay some interest
screen.
Well, then I sit within, you know, 10 TV.
Is that what you're going?
No, it's good to have your top one.
You've got to stand at 30 HDD, you don't need that IDF.
But the average consumer isn't really going to want to go higher, I mean, to them, it's
still higher.
Even if it's still higher, it'll start to, right, but I mean, $300 a player at this time
he got down to that.
That's expensive.
And this is like $1 to my $30 diss from movie.
It's serving out.
You go buy a DVD player for $20.
It's dead.
No.
So you know the old version of it.
Are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to,
are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are
you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, are you going to, I say, is it both K dynamic?
Yeah it's different. You64 really, really look forward to it. I, I, I'm rather紅 and chewing on my computer. I knew something else than I would know I said andőj deep學 how sure all of 128, 33 verses exceeds...
Oh I don't care they yourself, you just don't work. You just don't work. You just don't work. You just don't work. You just don't work. You just don't work. You just don't work. You can't take things, you just can't tell the difference. Yeah true.
his laptop speakers and I think I'm like that sounds horrible. He's sitting there
on it. What's the big deal? I think I'm like my wife's gun is pumping like stereo or something.
64 or 64 equipment in corned music on her phone that she takes to the gym whether she's
perfect. It drives meat nuts. She's probably getting happy with this to get a beat and
you know we're going to get a little bit older. I've got to have a 160 on file.
No, it's for 1.8. 2.5. 2.5. 6. I can't. 190. 160 is not good enough for you.
He's got a lot of stuff. He's got a lot of stuff.
You know, I do have actually every opponent that I have a classical music.
It's a classical music. I bet the last thing music you would be.
Just one classical music. So I had to encode it in a 33128.
And on my player was always loud and loud and you're not here.
And then I re-boiled it in all about 250, six or whatever it is.
56. And I can hear low and high. And I don't have to turn up and down.
I really prefer not to listen to the cymbals. The cymbals are easiest thinking here.
Messed up. They'll get like a little, the frequency will kind of waver a little bit.
If you have lower memory, because the cymbals don't encode well,
he's going to be great to do. So I've got to re-encode on my drum.
He's going to be great to do a lot of stuff.
Right. You know, it's easy to put it on the track.
And then you use all your equipment and then re-encode it.
So what you do is to get the band to get the best sound with the reasonable size.
I go log log and 160.
I've had the newest Nightwish CD. When I put that to log, I've got to do it.
I think I had to go over 300, because there's so much stuff going on with brass,
and it's in things, even at 256 in a log, it just explodes.
No, it just sounds like a big problem.
Because it can't.
So, but I'm giving it to me at the same bit rate.
It doesn't do it either. I mean, just
Mb3 probably had like a 192.
Okay. Mb3's are slightly less detailed than OGSR.
So you just got to make sure you go over the higher bit rate with the rain 3.
So many OGS will give you a better compression.
So 160 OGS is probably over to 128.
Okay. It's still.
If I just give my Mb3 to my son, then they sell off a wheat trader.
You know, my wife put it on her thing, and they don't do that.
He drinks right.
Yeah, I got a player that give it on.
I'm purposely not looking for one to give it on.
And it plays on.
It doesn't read the tanks on the on mine.
So, I've got this big long list of about 400 songs that I've struggled with.
Down with Rockbox.
Rockbox is really sweet, and it plays with all of them.
If it was more than like, what player do you have?
Incident Stagnia.
Oh.
Go to the, go on America.
Go on the bass.
I'm really like, go on.
I got to go on my son.
I audio 7, I'm just happy as a son.
It is so, because they come up with firmware updates to make sure
that things always up.
And it's got a lot of codex built into it.
It's just a well-made device, but they don't have types.
You know, the Cohen Tullet C-O-A-A.
It's just on flat, flat, they produce the nice big boxes, you know,
with the four-inch screen that you've been hooked up to your TV,
a new T-Ball off of it, not new.
They're really cool boxes, but can they get out of the net?
Is that one?
This is very exciting.
I audio, this is the 16-gig player.
And it's, uh, where do you put it?
This is one of the 16-gigs for an actual hardware drum,
that's probably in the net.
This is, they don't sell in stores.
They don't, well, I guess they do.
My order is, uh, last January, I want to say, it was, I think,
like, 250 units, I'm sure they're cheaper.
What's their big competitor?
Who's the other competitor off of it?
There's another guy.
Yeah, a little louder.
That's not the one, but, you know, Cohen is really good.
They got a lot of different codex.
When I was looking for my player, I wanted it all, you know,
so I bought it all, but then, thing,
it worked on Linux, okay?
There's an off support, but we those doesn't have an off support, man.
So, I, you know, didn't know it, but I didn't know that, you know,
but I thought, I see it, you need a map.
And this will plug right into the rhythm box,
to make sure you, uh, and it's here,
like that in order to do a good job.
They just make it compatible.
I mean, they're out there and they're trying to make it as compatible
with as many devices as possible, so, yeah.
I don't know what I was buying, but I do, uh,
uh, I don't know if they get an off audit.
Well, it isn't. It's not all that it's not really on the most places.
You look at it and you kind of wonder, you know, should I work?
Because it's the end, like you said, that you got to go to Amazon to buy it,
or they have their own store, but it's, yeah.
Is it really special, but it's so,
it's probably about average to a little bit more.
It could show if we were to have, uh, a wireless connection,
but you don't get a look in here.
Oh, look at it.
It will be a little bit filling.
Yeah.
But I'm really happy with it.
They ought to be.
I've been thinking of upgrading the fancy run-on,
giving this one to the white.
So, Christmas is gonna come up right here.
We're all on that.
It's the idea.
Yeah.
Oh, it doesn't matter, though.
Well, there's the newsletter.
Show me going to newsletter.
It's not going to be a newsletter.
Yeah, we're ready to go.
Yeah, we're ready to go.
We're ready to go.
Wow, people read newsletter.
So, you don't mean in your nanocave?
Do we have a more important point?
Yes, that's what it is.
I guess the first article was about, uh,
Ubuntu, uh, Intrepid.
Um, I installed it.
I like it.
I like it.
There are a few more articles, uh,
about this release and, uh,
what are the features and, uh,
uh,
stuff like that.
So, it's all ready.
Yeah.
Find the best features.
There's now, like,
hundreds of features.
What is your best feature?
I don't know.
The best feature was the
eighties and carrots.
Pretty cool and pretty cool.
The three, uh,
threerenefish.
Let me see, what is your best feature?
Ben.
Why did you choose my number three phone name?
Ben.
Why is my number three phone number three?
Because it's our phone number three phone number four.
I need this number three phone,
yeah, just basically your phone number three and you
seven DVDs, so with them, and you'd set up to see where we need to when they've made
all that cheap, filled with them. So I did that, and yeah, I got that. I think I got that
probably one 500 wrongs. Just remembering the arcade wrongs, they must be wrongs, you
could get that before the arcade game. Go for a word, you know what I'm saying, I was
saying. And then they can plug those in, and you run them on your computer to make
it work just like the game. Cool. I would say that one teacher what I like is this
new app, but here, that you, oh yeah, it doesn't bring up the, yes, the noir box. I don't
have her name, I don't have a sister. My sister's my sister works on here pretty good.
I don't even have a battery to make it worthwhile to do this there for us. It's like a
system for a while. At least a day or more. My battery's like another machine. They do have a
different power outlet for the heavy floor. It's a power off shut down. I need to go
with the people out here. I need to get a new one. And you like to shut that right there.
Three of them, but I've been asked your years old. There wasn't another battery, and I would
directly, is that what I read about the core? Yeah, I like that article. That was really
interesting. Basically, they came on with a core decision that said, you know, what these software
pens, most of them in these business process pens are pretty much all bogus. You know, they're,
so you're going to see you don't tie to a machine, or if it doesn't move from a place
day to place, be for a specific technology, we're not going to do pen time. They left the room,
the door open for some, but they gave two examples and they're a patent of a method of training
janitors to vacuum and dust using video. That was a patent. Someone tried to hack me that,
and they all saw. They said there's a lot of always patents and stuff. You know, things like
the Amazon one click and so these are things. Those aren't going to be patentable anymore. They're
going to throw out a lot of these patents because they just don't hold up the core. So,
that'll be a good thing if you don't get all these patent companies that buy all the stuff and
then they just go out and sue, you know, everybody and stuff. Which is interesting. This is
very interesting to open up because actually it gave them a great name. They had no patents,
and recently there was some, some four case, and it turns that right now they can start
to get patents on the software. So it's interesting. It was interesting that Red Hat is a big
proponent of getting rid of the patents. They wrote some papers to help this decision along
and stuff. So it really hurts that because they want everything to be, they want to move
software. It wasn't truly as an open source in any of their stuff. Not that the patents
are really hurting. Yes, aren't they? Yeah. So there are two articles about that. The
Fiora 1.0 release. Yes, I did. I read a little bit of all that. It looks like some of the new,
this is a video clip. Yes, it's a video clip. Actually, they say that probably once the
holders get up to a certain point that we come here with the next bid, is there going to be
when you open. Because as of right now, the Fiora is gone. What did you change the
over and over? There's a new in New York. I'm going to say you don't need my patents, but I'm
going to say it's really rare. If you go by, if you're working directly on a lease, no, it's not
a car. It's not that the car that should run out is the issue. It's the company's new
and there's a bad person cooler up for you. I guess you can stay back. Fiora 1.0 has the ability to be
better than M.A. But all of that is not right now. It's just like we were talking and did go back
and look at the incoheritum as far as the difference here. The fund duration of the source acting
on the M.A. back. X-Bid is M.A. 4. Here's to it. Could you see it's M.A. 4. Pretty much everything is M.A. 4.
So if you're a player, please, no, you had four or a little bit of playing experience if you
customer in sc� or just you're probably going to throw up to the end and throw up to these color
two-and-ones. They're different. So this co-ent is not really co-expanded through acid.
But come up with an M.A. 4. About this and co-drown. Our co-ent will be co-drown different
than they come up with a different M.A. 4. But they're all M.A. 4. We're getting to see sure you
So basically you could still use this and create your mp4 and that's the mp4 is actually
cheap and that's the cheap one. So it's not open, not open, right? And there are two
even colors or you're right now. There's their color, there's an unstable one that some
people have written out and they have a big version of the mainline branch and it is significant
and better than the better. It's like factor of 5 for me. On this other stage, two, six,
four of it and all this stuff. I mean, is that the competitor or the same? It's another type of
me color for mp4. Oh, and or any of the features. Like mp4 is actually got, I think, like 20 or
30 different colors that it could have if it played the one that's the service for all of the
colors, which can be the issue. So the H264 has support for higher resolution videos. Let's get
on to being much better in compression. It's just, that's just there's smaller. It's the
color for showing that. It's still in mp4. And I heard that you'll see the H264, as you
know, they're a more video-capped for dip systems with lower resolution, so they're good at
learning a smaller resolution. They're just trying to scale it out of the full HD. I like this
thing to make sure it's spinning right or this is good. That was a flash support. I'm going to
create that orange side change using mp4. Oh, the bar at the time. I think that's what YouTube
used this time. There was actually a lot of time for all of them to do what I was seeing all of that.
What is this right now? It's all the orange side change. That's the way that's good. Great.
That's where it is. There are a couple of programs. It's our scene. It's our scene.
There was an article about open office now in browser with the CEO. I think that you are talking about the CEO.
Do you read that article? No, no. They update it through all of this in mp4.
Very slow. Very slow. I think that that's talking that you download like a plugin.
Yeah, but it's a funny way to do these programs. So you do it open office to see the
production of all of them. Yes. I get my desktop. It's basically on there.
Oh, you know, and then you also have to have your desktop where you're laptop,
and then where you're taking, you know, that can send your decision to.
So this is what I'm going to talk about open office. I also have open office 3.
This text is correct. And because we got all of these, I changed it at 40 of the programs.
So I am slow by open office 2.4. I'm going to do it some side.
And I've downloaded the dev file. And then I sold that file.
I sold a few pages. It is still no problem.
As well as the installation of the integrated desktop integration and the desktop integration.
So this is the directory. So that's pretty much what it would be.
Any big changes? Three. I can do.
I like that.
I think it's a kind of version.
Okay.
Because it was one thing that I wanted to use, that's why it's not the field.
Okay.
Well, you have a better company.
I've done that. I've done that. You know, you need that to hire a contractor.
So you can do that or do that for us in this project.
There's a lot of semantic content.
If you go to the link, you can do the standard one.
So all of the office, you can put all of the data.
And then different programs that you can actually run on there.
Yeah.
There's an interesting thing.
So actually, you've got to open the database.
You've got to open the database, you've got to draw this program from Mac.
Okay. That was kind of really important to me.
So I need to customize this.
I think it was a drawing, but there's a drawing in that I could graphically.
Graphics, yes.
You're going to need to ask me to start there right now.
I think putting it in your actions, or I'm going to take this first.
I'm going to do it in areas.
I want to do it.
I want to do it.
I want to do it.
I don't remember what the design expression on those two.
Yeah, I want to say each one of them.
You know, I impact your strategy to do it now.
That's the way they should do it.
In package manager, I could go ahead and say,
I want to have it as far as they can.
We brought up the money there.
You can install it.
You can install it.
You can install it.
You can install it.
So that's how open office needs to do it.
If they want to be, you can have people.
Very good.
No.
Seriously.
If they want to be, I know that I know somebody is going to look at it and go,
well, this doesn't do much.
This stuff office does.
For instance, it's going to say, oh, here's my office suite.
And let it spread out.
That you cannot say, this is my office suite.
You go to, well, you don't have office suite,
but it is by the area way of working in it.
What else do we have there?
We never have to be aware of server two shows
that improvements in some of the region on it.
I read a little bit of it.
And it does.
But I don't remember a whole lot.
But we run a little version one something
that work and we're now switching to the ESX.
We're testing on the ESX, which I really like.
They were running HP servers.
Well, I've got the HP.
We're going to be sitting up some ESX rituals.
So I should five minutes to open up a box, HP box,
and put the ESX server on and get it running.
I've been in five minutes.
You take the CD and put it in your dual edict,
do as Installer, you get one fixed IP address, you're done.
You don't have to do anything else.
And so then just from that point on, you just open up a browser,
go to that IP address, and there's all your setup for VMs and stuff,
where you can send things in and out.
You don't have to install any patches.
You don't have to.
But it even has the HP insight manager settings.
So to open up the ESX VM, you'll tell you your fan speed,
your temperature, your seat, your power supply,
they've done the seat.
Because actually this course is very similar.
And I think it's on a base day.
They had, they had barewall, like the ESX version.
So they actually use this goal, hopefully, or two.
So you actually don't have a console anymore.
You actually don't have a console anymore.
This server too, yeah.
Server too, that's also the way it went.
I think I just installed it home in my desktop machine.
Yeah, it's not installed onto the Linux,
but it runs three minutes of the VMs right now.
And I can still follow through it.
It's actually, I want to try to read and rebuild it
in a lot of ways, like we're actually free up the newer hardware,
because I mean, I've got the fan distance too out of it.
That $200, the Walmart computer,
it doesn't have a fanable processor,
but it has a fan-owned KHS supply.
And power supply, they're a cheap fan,
and it's starting to have a line.
So I do, I want to plug it.
It doesn't actually have a slot, like a big slot for it,
a fan that you stick in the case.
So it does have a huge haul in the whole case.
So the case doesn't need to have a fan.
You know, the, it's going to get away from the processor.
It's going to give some kind of flow.
I, I don't think that you can even need it.
I think it's going to be fine.
The processor is going to get lost.
If it's flowing on the power supply,
I would not unplug that.
To be good at my VM.
That would not be needed.
I have to, it's fully going for you while.
Cool, right?
Totally right there.
So, uh, and then,
longsides are going to go down and come to the top.
Yeah.
You can, you can, you can, the PC's up to all of them so.
Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't,
anything.
We can all get ready to go.
I told you so.
You could just, just have to have the power supply.
No, I know.
Yeah, that was a guy, that was the PC,
that power supply won't last long, but a fan.
You guys know, it's not going to last long.
Most fans that have power supply are here,
right now.
I'm wondering, what are you, what are you, what are you, what are you.
Uh, do you have that?
I can stick her.
No, that's okay.

waste a gigabyte in this space, that's right, that's right, the navigation is the other
dance garden, dance garden is actually supposed to be pretty good actually, it's so very
to it, there used to be a Christiano-Bunzu using the dance garden, the icy license is so shaky,
it's a GPL, it's something different, so there's a dispute if it's open source or not,
mando, mando is, I think it's a dispute, back up, a secret Mario Chronicles,
Mario is a game, Mario, who the why, and for copyright reasons, and not always sound
a burger, I think that actually this is very similar to like a video and not always, and you
right click, you can actually have different plugins, so this is not the same thing if you
install it, then if you're right click on it, then you are welcome option, what do you want
to transport or to? We're going to talk to you about EVIPK, so they're starting about
instance, we'll be doing it, we have, there's something about ALSA, one point is you're all
18, it's finally available in ways, whatever that means for us, 15 secrets, all of them, all
how we, all scariest, it was all how we, and the scary tax, cute, cute does not equate to
scary tax, well, when I see a tax that's just like the alien thing, I'll be back, it's cute,
if you want to scare me, there's a book with a show called Blast, read the reviews for
Blast, look at your blind, all right, it's like 90 minutes, no intermission, people being tortured,
it's an accident scene where if somebody sucks, somebody fives out, it needs to,
you know, say things out, they actually have to have the actors have to have like, you know,
psychological consultants to come in, and they cancel that names, because none of the people
can stand to do the show twice in a row, oh my god, yeah, so we've got to do some, I have a lot of
of them, I don't know, just a bit, we'll see what we can do, we're talking about ladies,
computer and media center, so there's a hard one, so there's a part in, I thought it was pretty cool,
because there was a lot of them on the wall, for the vibe, I mean, they had the TV there,
but the first one, the next something, those were windows, Xbox, it was pen and,
what it is, oh, that was an article about Ure, that's one, Ure didn't throw,
using, at this link, R&D, all that, I didn't read it, but I should, I hope you are using it, I was using it,
happy people and other people visiting, you know, all that part, you was talking all that,
and, you know, introverted to the update, thank you, that was a moment with the name,
somebody, make it into somebody, and she was actually in my island, and she had a dog there,
so it was kind of interesting, the side of the problem, Photoshop Express,
Photoshop Express is a browser-based obligation, dream limits, because you were trying dream limits,
that is your view, dream limits, I read that, and I don't know, this is a decent room,
I think it was fairly accurate, but yeah, I didn't agree with it, they said what they had
it installed and weren't great, but it wasn't impressive, you know, as far as the idea of this,
that installs a bit work right now, it's really another, a distro has to really do some really cool
stuff that will be the way it will go to, I mean, just because you want to go mainstream if you can,
you know, you take the bill into something like that, you're behind versions, because they don't
have to be in a very long time, you know, unless they're trying to do a backlight, they go in
where they try to control the whole thing, and the NSA is watching, because you don't want
to be stuck in New Brazil all the time, stay on the road, stay on the road, stay on the road,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah we're more so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're more still not the same thing
So, somebody is working as a paid, who are talking about B.E.P.
B.E.O.
Or a bridge that broke around the end.
Okay.
So, somebody is actually working on the project as a paid person
full time.
Now, we can rest in time for you to.
Yeah.
Well, it's not that we're probably going to be the one that
keeps our work in time.
It's not just a food tour, it's a, it's a, I think it's a home project.
So, they're, they're paid to work on an upstream basically.
So, the per se, everyone will get the benefits.
Yes.
And I don't think it's actually canonical, who is paying that per se.
Somebody else was paying that per se.
This is the per se.
That could be the killer act to put the clinics in the mainstream
to help people, their sites.
They, this is the area where, with real bank houses all useless,
because they can't be tied down with those.
They can't, you know, wait for Microsoft and all that and fix their stuff.
You know, they've got, you know, 5,000 PCs rendering this.
It's been running for one year.
They got to fix it.
They have to have the things, they have to have the things now.
So, they're all running clinics.
Exactly.
Yeah, I mean, anybody who thinks, Linux is mainstream through
graphics works.
And go to secret from, you know, lots of folks who do really big
projects and links and stuff.
We were actually in the media show with the fractal.
They had a guy from, I alone, the Lucas thing.
They had a clip from us.
I was three.
But you can see he was using Linux.
Yeah.
And it all was useless.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you can see, I have them in there.
And they have their links.
Yeah.
Or they have to work together constantly.
Yeah.
Or it's where you can see that in the lower rooms.
But the thing is, you got to produce this program down to the consumer
health level.
Right.
Right.
People get so complicated that all people touch all their program for all
customers.
Yeah.
That all comes from all customers and teens.
I mean, they have so many different sides.
There's two different sides.
There's the production side and then there's the consumers.
Right.
And you need the consumers side.
That's what I think is missing in the Linux is a nice, easy, consumer side.
I want to get my video camera editing in there just to show you some about
talking about an intro.
Well, somebody goes to the key as an intro level.
But it is really wild.
It is an intro level.
But you can tell it's a video otherwise.
You can't forget about it.
And then there's a little bit higher consumer element.
Well, I guess I hear a lot of people, you know, use the windows who will be
made here just because it comes with windows.
And it's simple.
You can add sound.
You can add a few transitions.
They can cut case or video.
And they're done.
You know, stuff.
But there is really something not that easier or works your life.
There's stuff that easier than Linux.
But it just doesn't work here.
There's still a lot of talking.
Go to nfl.com.
And you can actually like cut together your own like clips.
Bring in the flash and flip right.
And it's using, I think it does.
You upload your clips to it.
Thank God.
Well, they've got all the clips from all over the world.
They've got a little blogging and stuff.
You can just edit it.
You can add like background music to all your transitions there.
It's okay.
You can author it in like a myth TV.
And a lot of those, you can just some degree.
It's like a myth TV.
It's a myth TV.
I mean, it's not.
It's really a myth TV.
You definitely already can edit out different parts of your video and such.
I think you can then put it together on DVD as well.
And then TV actually does like a full-bending system.
It never be boring.
I'm kind of going back.
I looked around and virtual boxes.
Not that hard.
It's a pretty similar connection.
They actually provide a command line utility that sets it all up.
You just type it in.
And there you go.
There's your just way easier.
Yeah.
You're just waiting against it.
There's a minute already.
I was able to do it just now.
Maybe when I was out there.
Maybe when I was out there.
Maybe when you're finally going away out.
You're giving?
What?
Really finally going away out?
I think I can't go this way.
And then you get there.
Okay.
Sure we go up there.
There are a few of our jokes.
And there was a tutorial poll or a blender.
There was something about money.
