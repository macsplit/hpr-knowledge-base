This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3,795 for Friday the 17th of February 2023.
Today's show is entitled, 2022-2023 New Year's Show Episode 1.
It is part of the series HP Our New Year Show.
It is hosted by HP Our Volunteers and is about 84 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is 2022-2023 New Year's Show where people come together and chat the year
away.
Okay, I've got a backup stream running, testing, testing.
In the backup stream running, are you running another stream?
Do you see you have a backup stream running?
Is there anybody out there?
Maybe.
Do you see you set up another stream?
Are you out there?
No, Ken.
Two minutes, honky.
Yep.
Do you see you set up another stream?
Can you hear me?
Okay, I'm full of sleep.
What?
Who's full of sleep?
Can you hear me?
Can you not hear me?
Ha ha ha ha.
Well, that's not good.
Yep.
Well, yes.
There was something.
Can you hear me now?
And you hear me?
Ten seconds.
Well, hello everybody and welcome to the 11th annual HP Our New Year's Eve Show.
Yay!
Where we welcome in each and every time zone as the join the New Year and say goodbye to 2022
and welcoming 2023.
This intro should have been done by honky, but he's having...
I believe you are having the technical issues.
Some issues.
And apparently, Ken can't hear me.
Hey, that might enter joined.
Just in time.
Good morning, everybody.
The 11th annual Hacker Public Radio New Year's Eve Podcast.
Where we spend about 26 hours sitting around talking.
And hopefully I can get it out a lot faster than June or July when I finally got it out this year.
Again, big ups to HP Lovecraft for helping with the show notes last year and helping speed up and get it out.
Ken apparently seems to be having some issues.
To me, this has always been a lot of fun and it was actually my introduction into podcasting.
I probably told this story a couple of times before for those who have listened to previous podcasts.
But the HP Our New Year's show was that because it was so open that anyone could just join in for a few minutes and say something and then leave.
It was kind of my introduction to podcasting.
It kind of broke down that wall of listener to creator.
I enjoy doing it.
I enjoy hosting it.
I enjoy listening to it afterwards.
And I hope that it encourages other people to start podcasting.
So that might are you awake?
Yeah, actually, I've been awake for quite a while.
So if I fall off the world, it has a spirit to it.
But the body said no.
No, I got you.
And I'm just going up a little bit ago.
Luckily I got some death wish coffee for Christmas and I just killed the last of it.
Well, I have caffeinated beverages setting bloated up six liters of them.
But I need more than that.
I'm in trouble.
Yeah.
Well, I'm just going to end up mute.
Hello.
Good morning, Ken.
Can you guys hear?
Can you hear me?
Yeah, no.
Oh, OK.
Sorry, don't know what happened there.
You did the intro, I presume.
I kind of followed up with what you started.
Oh, I can hear a thing.
So that was weird.
That's all right.
Did you say you started up another stream?
I have a recording going remotely.
Can you just see how that works?
Although it doesn't appear to be working.
Well, that's not good.
Is that working to see?
Actually, I think it's, I was hoping it was only W otherwise known as L.
Oh, OK.
More and say it's nice, but A.W.
Chase and set her place.
Happy New Year from Thailand.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Our thing's in Thailand.
More and see you in company.
Our thing's in Thailand.
Good.
We just visited another elephant sanctuary.
Cool.
Museum.
Yeah.
Well, if you don't keep up your exercise, you'll be flying home FedEx.
Is the recording started?
Oh, yeah.
Apology.
So many of them I can't get feel seek my mind to play it.
With the audio stream?
Yeah.
Let me just try it again.
It also could be on my side.
Let's see what we can do here.
No, it's playing.
It's playing.
Oh, good.
Playing with streams is fun.
I hate it every year.
We have this.
First two hours of the show was also debugging audio stream.
So the stream is working.
That's fine.
Problem on my end.
Yeah.
I was saying the other day, I just switched mics.
And then everything that was working perfectly fine.
And so I'm sitting there and playing with the PAVU control with that minor talking, trying to troubleshoot.
What's the matter?
Yes.
If you ever need someone to fill a shift with random chatter, email me.
Well, listen, we got about 26 hours here.
That comes in the aftershock.
That's right.
I mean, I don't accept it.
It is interesting with 5150 Storing Show.
This about this time of year.
Storing show, the book review from the bottom of a well in a noisy truck.
Yeah, when I mentioned 5150's collection of purses, they wondered if they took him on his last ride.
But he didn't want to wait there.
I think he just had the one.
But he wanted to go into a horse convention.
And he had all those pictures of the many different horses that he saw.
Well, I didn't know until he was gone.
How good a friend.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Hunky, what type of stream is that?
An algorithm P3.
I think I have two different ways of being inside their algorithm.
Flack.
I don't know.
I think it's primarily all I don't touch anything right now.
No, no, no, no.
It's here.
I'll break it.
No, no, no, no.
I think I might have it once it.
By recording through the stream through, but seem to work out pretty well.
Yeah, you have that running, I hope.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I started that up.
Well, there you go.
I sent a message to Lovecraft.
I don't know if he's actually up.
Oh, and the, yeah, yeah.
Was he in the luckiest room at Snyder?
Yeah, he's been in the luckiest room, but I said hello a couple of times,
but didn't get a response.
So I don't know if he's like me.
He's just been leaving his hook in the water.
Probably.
Now, Morton, see, did any elephants pick you up?
Yeah, the second time, the other place we were at,
an elephant picked me up also after I fed him.
The picture should be posted from a few minutes ago.
Well, good thing that Ella is not the yellow type.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll worry about the Tiger, not not an elephant.
Yeah.
Well, I think, I think you need to worry about the girls of Thailand,
about as much as you have to worry about lizards in Bangkok.
So where is our New Year's window right now?
Does anyone know?
Where does it start off?
Let's see, I think it's the Chatham Islands.
New Zealand.
Yep.
Those two.
Oh, and Christmas Island.
Chatham Islands are the next hour.
Well, happy New Year, Christmas.
Merry Christmas, related.
Following our experience with the stream, I have,
I haven't set a mumble on my new computer yet.
Nor have I put in the SSD yet.
I figured I will stay with the older hardware
that I know works and do heart surgery on my new computer
when I'm more arrested.
Hey, since?
I had a bit of a, could have, had a V8 moment.
My computer, I know, is a, supports both SATA and NVMe M2 drives.
And I picked up a SATA drive.
I could have gone NVMe, but since I was planning on using this more
for fast bulk storage, SATA should be fast enough for my purposes.
Yeah, I basically look at it as things like SSDs,
as you want to putting on as the operating system and everything else,
I don't care what the speed is.
Well, what, what I'm hoping to do is to be able to emulate larger systems,
larger storage, as I'm experimenting with stuff.
Yeah, so I got the, I was telling you about the USB 4B,
for hard drive bay thing that I got right.
So I got Armbian onto the Rock 64.
I got the 4B plugged in.
So Armbian is running and it recognizes all four hard drives
that I put into the bay.
And I got to figure out whether I want to do an LVM with them
or just have them as separate drives for separate storages,
or exploring separate things.
And then I got to try to put that, I think I'm going to use that
Docker installing the routine on an RPI Docker image and see if that works.
Yeah, I've pretty much come to conclusion that while Ubuntu is supporting podman
during my learning period, I'm going to have to run a VM
and use it as a Docker host.
Now, why, why would you use a VM to me as a Docker host?
Because I'm going to be running cockpit as a general manager
and it manages VMs pretty well.
And then if I run a VM as a Docker host,
you see that cockpit does not have the Docker manager
has been depreciated in modern cockpit.
Okay.
I think I ran...
Yeah, I have podman up.
I don't know.
I really don't use it.
But the only thing I have right now running on a Docker container
is the Etherpad.
We use it as show notes.
So I'd like to run podman, but at the moment it's undocumented.
And one of the first folks that documented is coming out early February for 60 bucks.
That's odd.
Well, the Red Hat people may understand how to translate a Docker to podman.
But they haven't yet the first person to actually do it so that mere models can do it.
It's clearly planning on making bank on it.
I would possibly talk to Danny.
I want to say Danny's been running podman.
Is that Joe?
It's indeed Joe.
Wow.
We have minus Danny.
We have most of the lug cast here.
Well, my issue is I'm not going to be here real long right now because I haven't slept yet.
Well, that's not good.
Why not?
I gave it a shot.
Work out.
I've been on a couple of times and nobody else was on and talking.
Well, that's because it didn't start till now.
Okay.
I saw the recording.
It started heading.
Yeah.
Fallen recording was already on here.
Well, he was on here.
But you were here.
Well, me and here right now.
That's just a stream.
I was having to use what the running this stream.
I was telling you started earlier than.
Yeah, I've been one of this.
The stream has been up for about two days now.
It's exciting.
That was great.
We've been wrestling that day on Irishman.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got a new headset for Christensen.
So I plugged it in first.
Oh, what'd you get?
What'd you get?
Oh, Logitech.
It's model here.
D45.
Logitech is not bad.
Yeah.
It's comfy as well.
Yeah.
I've already been hitting the fence this morning.
Been keeping the weight like trying to pull anything.
Yeah.
I'm trying to get some junk volume in because it's fun.
Maybe I'll go up and wait here in a little bit.
But I'm not going to go super high today.
Elbows have been bothering me again.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
And I ended up with bruises like right above my elbows.
Hi, Joe.
Didn't actually get hit.
What?
That high Joe.
Hi, Joe.
Hey, how's it going?
Good.
Wait.
I'm good.
Thank you.
So your bar in Mordancy for us for a couple of months.
You know, we should start up the Jitsy.
Nobody wants to see us this early in the morning.
Speak for yourself, homie.
I'm looking great.
Zero sleep got my pump on.
I look epic.
Let's see.
I actually got a new camera too.
I did too, but it's garbage.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a test of mine.
Oh, yeah.
No, I went by five and below.
And they have a dash cam that you can get there for like ten bucks.
Yeah.
Well, it's five and below.
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, you want me to start the Jitsy?
I can do that.
But the whole thing is it actually works as a webcam as well.
Look at my camera.
Not the crappy one.
I'll give it a try in a minute, but it is pretty bad.
Quality wise.
All right.
Can you spell Jitsy again?
Let's see how I can screw up some audio.
Can you use the name of password again?
Use your camera.
And I'll wait.
Use your camera.
I have to use the name of password.
Oh, look.
There I am.
First, I have it up there.
Switch these.
Oh, I can't.
Am I constantly looking up?
What do you see me?
Do you see me?
No, not yet.
Kill this thing with fire.
Oh, hey, I see a mortancy.
Hi, Donkey.
Hi, how's it going?
I'm good.
Thank you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, we can hear you.
Okay.
I was having some USB issues there for a minute.
Do you like music?
Yes.
The coffee cups are awesome.
My name is Phil.
Not Paul, by the way.
Paul Shafers.
This is the orchestra.
Did I put Paul on the address?
Yeah.
Oh.
It was apparently printing something.
Aren't I always printing something?
What are you printing now?
Oh, it's a different style of a latch box.
Let's try it out.
I have Philip Britton down.
What?
There we are.
Is that correct?
Yep.
Okay.
How I see that upright and down.
I should have written it straight from my contacts on my phone.
Okay.
You must have thought it confused me with Paul Shafers from the CDS orchestra.
And look at that.
Happy New Year, everyone.
We have Joe working out and a printer in the back.
Well.
The kids need to enjoy all of that.
Well.
Okay.
I switched windows a little bit.
Oh.
We should post this.
Is there anybody in there that you know isn't one of us?
Let's see.
Ken is going to the hardware store.
And I don't know who Spoon is.
But then you did.

inspired by Ok forums.
here that speed lift broke signs well South Korea had those two they were just mostly
suggestion right of way was mostly a suggestion and NERSHA was ignored completely they were
seen a mole pad get run over by a fifth wheeler because they parked between the between
the truck and the trailer and thought that was a good idea to stop light like a normal
semi either it was a launcher a launcher yeah a Patriot missile system I'll get him
it him it in trailer this guy was more enough to bail off his mole pad that's where I'm
at more than this I wish I was that tired so you've been up all night yeah what do you do
mostly this that here in front of my computer trying to pet pet G to print properly
oh yeah pick up everything put him back down and I know I'm supposed to be getting
up at like eight no I could probably do get up at nine supposed to be going to check out
sam's club today yeah by the only one with the password and the user name for
to see no I got it okay like I said I'm a log off shortly and do that whole well try and
sleep thing hello jeal spark good morning from Jacksonville Florida good morning
hello or things in Jacksonville all right guys I'm gonna step away for a little while
all right try to get some rest
I'll see
to net miner what were you trying to set up in uh with uh docker containers and podman
did you have anything in mind that you want to try out no I've been studying docker
rancher stuff like that for a while I and when I installed the podman control I was hoping
that there was more documentation so that I could actually do some of the translation
now did you try uh did you have uh podman installed can you try just starting it up and
because podman is a uh is a web oh yeah I think it's a web GUI it's it's kind of straightforward
I thought I don't think yeah I mean you might have those track things up straight through podman
the web GUI but it's got some like advanced features to it I remember yeah well I'd like to know
say you could map uh map the the docker stuff over but since I don't know either I would like
to have a little more clarity and since docker documentation is available by the time uh
uh I may just spin up a a uh small server instance uh and uh and run something like
14 or or rancher um good morning good afternoon and uh good evening most people in the
well hello how are you is needed oh no I also wait for is it just me it's currently 545 in the
morning here and I'm on my morning I must do 20,000 steps for sunrise anyone else in
anyone else wow yeah we're in here can you not hear us hello geos part hello sir can you hear us
they keep me noting himself so I think well I think he's using a mutant instead of a push to talk
I'm muting if you should still be able to hear though all these are definitely himself I keep
looking over at the stream just to make sure that my audio is still being picked up
wait is use this morning where Ken wasn't picking me up and I was getting very nervous
but it turned out it was on Ken's end uh maybe thought about but have you uh tried just learning
some of the basics of um docker like just uh just get one of your raspberry pies spin it up
install uh docker and then try to just run a container I haven't yet again I've been
romantic with stuff uh right now I'm going to be doing some fundamental networking uh networking stuff to
so that so that the machines that I'm going to be using for me I think they have a
an open bridge now the other day you were talking about the pf sensor lot do you have the
pfs and pf sensor installed yeah I have it running on a small uh mini computer now what
what are you doing with it besides the very obvious like have you do you have uh like um
what is it snort or any uh intrusion detection setup or anything no I I have it just as a basic
as as a primary firewall DHCP um that may be changing when when I get a full blown uh uh
pie hole extended pie hole up how do you plan on changing that uh but well I may move my DHCP to
uh pie right there was a car coming this can you set a pie hole to do DHCP or you're just
gonna set DHCP on the same thing that you're running pie hole on oh pie hole we'll we'll do
local DNS it will do DHCP if we do a whole bunch of stuff it's far more more than than an ad blocker
right but uh yeah it's uh that's his purpose is a look it's a local DNS to do ad blogging isn't it
well that's that's what it starts at uh if you link it with unbound you can get
uh authoritative DNS from primary sources and uh it will also do local DNS and as part of local
DNS it will also if you want to you can activate a DHCP server okay so when I set it up I may
also yeah um I had run the Raspberry Pi's I uh put diet pie on it put pie hole on and then I
redirected um I want to redirected my internal DNS over to it so it hit that first um and it
seemed to work out pretty well except for there was some things that my wife did that uh that
it seemed to block for some reason and there should be able to just kind of uh do one click
shut off of it or temporary shut off or uh set an allowable for whatever reason
that should fit it was just the diet pie version of it but I wasn't able to do that so I want
to just taking it down and I never want to put it back up well I've got I've been working on
getting a few things together um but just getting this new box straight now it's amazing to see
this little one-liter box or place a pretty beefy tower yeah of course now I'm going to have to
look for some storage solutions but that that's uh that can be made optional that's why I'm looking
at secure FTP because uh I have many machines and more disks than I know what to do with
oh cool now I can excellent
now be done anything with your uh pie is it 800 is the little keyboard one um I haven't been doing
as much as I might uh when I was working with it I was having trouble with uh was it powering
up reliably yeah I don't know I have a I'm going to have to try uh to see whether it was the
power supply or just a bed uh power connector it may be that the uh pie foundation is
on on on their uh pie 400s baby shaving the quality of the input uh socket a little bit
well there was those old number with the uh the pie fours for having issues where you had to have
like a certain type of um uh power connector when they first came out and may have something to do
with that because it's uh it's got a pie four inside of it yeah well I know they did they did a
software update to fix that no they did a hardware problem to fix that problem I think I don't remember
but it was a nice way when the first came out well what I've got is I've got a can to get uh two
gig pie that uh that I could use for other things I was going to use it for uh open media vault but
I'll have to see uh what the deal is uh since it's not up I I may switch power supplies and see if
see if getting a good quality and candy kids supposed to be pretty good quality
we have a new hello coming on happy new year right where are my uh you have that up
let's bring it up here two two two two two and uh which one is this one
i've just got the clock i don't have the map
Let's see, and the first hour.
Hey, big guy.
Hey, big guy.
Why?
Let's see.
I believe this is when we welcome in.
Greetings to Chetman.
Chetman.
I cannot.
I guess Chapman Islands, New Zealand.
Chapman Islands.
I'm trying to fill in the show notes from the beginning of the first hour.
Let's chat with Honki Mortonsu, Joe Ken and others.
We talked about pie hole.
What else do we talk about?
Pie hole, podman.
A little bit about PFM.
Give sense.
And something about my new micro PC.
All right.
I actually looked up.
My mini PC uses laptop RAM.
And I had Nate gig stick sitting here waiting for it for a good home.
Cool.
But now my eight gig machine off the shelf has 16 gigs.
Nice.
So it's been kind of nice with the.
With the Raspberry Pi acting as a cash.
Installations and upgrades are all coming off the cash instead of necessarily coming.
Down the net down the wire.
Good.
One of the things that I'm also learning about is network managers.
Network managers text user interface.
It's something called an M to you.
And it's so you're going to be able to do a lot of the stuff that most people would
think you need the graphical interface to do.
But evidently network manager.
Well, first it has a lot of modules for SSH and other things that I don't think anybody really explores.
But it appears that there's a that it can be manipulated just as effectively over over a minimal.
You know, over SSH or whatever.
Cool.
Well, what I'm what I'm going to do and I'll start with a reserve with one of my secondary machines is I'm going to put the switch the.
To make a bridge with that will basically take the place of the primary network connection wire connection.
That way the way work manager works is that it puts in its own net layer by default for networking.
But if the machine already has a bridge arranged appropriately to act as a network switch.
You can switch the networking so that your VMs plug into the bridge as an internal switch.
And they get all their DHCP and all their goodness from just like they were physical machines.
Cool.
Yeah, I mean, I uncovered a bunch of stuff recently and I just haven't with the holiday and everything coming up.
I had a chance to really sit down and dig into anything.
And once I get things settled, I hope to install some emulators.
All right.
Is that in Jitsy?
Born Steve.
You Jitsy.
Hello.
There we go.
I hear you going through Jitsy and I'm like, I thought it was on mumble.
Any left?
No, there he is.
Hello.
All right.
I don't forget this out.
Now, is there a?
Yes, let's see.
You're using for for the new areas.
Hello.
Is there what?
Is there a web map or something that I should put up?
I'm using the show notes for.
For the.
The show.
The show has.
The show notes is broken up into many different segments for each hour.
And try to keep track of things.
Link to the show notes is on the have to public radio site.
Let's see.
I put it here.
Good.
And it is.
All right.
I think that should do it.
Okay.
You're in a tunnel.
We're going to just get really dark where you are.
Oh.
It got dark quick.
Real quick.
Good lord.
Did you guys have a dusk or was it just daylight in the dark?
Yeah.
When I was showing the show the temple and.
Tain that it kind of looked like Florida.
But there was the sunset was on the side.
So yeah.
The sun was going out.
And it's just just different below the horizon.
So do you guys have any big plans for New Year's?
Yes.
We're heading right now to see her friends.
They that she grew up with at the school.
They're looking forward to meeting me.
They're excited.
And then we to drive back.
Like about two hours to get back to her.
Brothers house.
For the.
For to celebrate New Year's.
Cool.
So we'll probably miss it because we keep being late to everything.
When when we miss the plane flight.
Just by like 10 minutes.
To fly from Bangkok to intent.
Google said it would be like just over six hours for the drive.
And then it was like stop and go traffic the entire time.
It was like 14 four.
It was terrible.
Oh, did you hear what happened to Southwest Airlines?
I did not.
Southwest Airlines was yelling at some of their ground people
because they weren't get because the it was horribly cold in Denver.
And one of their higher ups decided while the guys were busting their asses that
he should encourage them a little more in frostbite weather.
I heard something like 28 of them quit on the spot.
And when you 28 people who are dealing with holiday traffic pull out airplanes don't launch.
And soon it snowballed because when flights don't happen from one place they start
and it's snowballs and snowballs and snowballs.
Also Southwest Airlines has been using 1990s aircraft scheduling software.
Excellent.
Which was great when anything was flowing nicely when it started getting hammered
with thousands of cancellations and reschedules and whatnot.
The fourth thing just went.
Belly up.
So the only way Southwest is getting getting back on the air was to basically shut its entire system down.
And reset everything and then then start their schedule from scratch.
Also Southwest Airlines has no peering connections with other airlines.
So when you can't fly Southwest you're on your own.
Awesome.
I have a feeling that there's going to be some serious restructuring in Southwest Airlines if they survive.
I want to imagine.
An old hippie friend who passed away a few years ago.
I mean he was in his 70s probably but he was still happy.
Said that's carrying the package by the granality of knife.
There's carrying the package by the string and then there's carrying the package by the moon.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Southwest Airlines people were having trouble getting to work.
They were calling in sick calling in you know snowed in or whatever.
And the management responded that you'd better have a doctor's a verifiable doctors.
But no when you when you come in and that didn't really encourage people to show up.
And the people on the ground when they when the bosses said you've got to fill in the difference decided they could fill in the difference somewhere else.
Yes.
Just for I know you and I honky are nice and warm with the western half of the United States is getting the baked Alaska treatment without the without the bakery.
Yeah.
So I think some of that's improving though.
Well, actually I don't know about the rest of the world.
I know I have family down in Florida.
Florida got nice and cold for a little while.
But they're starting to warm back up in.
Yeah, well, the yeah, the warm air is coming up.
It's going to be like 50.
It's going to be 50 around New England.
Right.
And the middle of the country is going to get snow and rain.
More inspiration.
Last night and tonight.
Last night, we're getting the coldest temperatures here in Thailand at 23 degrees Celsius.
Wow.
It's a frigid winner here.
Sit down.
Does this sound okay? Can I be heard?
Yeah, you're fine.
Right.
Yeah, they're just setting up.
I was listening for a while whilst doing some meals.
That'll be long for a bit now and that'll be some meals.
And they'll come back later as well.
I think that's for all of us too.
Well, somebody...
Well, actually, wasn't that 5150 or somebody basically stayed for the whole thing in the past?
Oh, 26 hours, yeah.
I think you tried that one for you.
You died, didn't you?
Yeah.
Well, if any Americans came back, it's 5am or I don't know, early hours of the morning.
6.30 East Coast.
And we have greetings to Northwark Island and Kingston.
I like my...
I was going to do this all through now as well, like every time I've seen you.
Right, this place has come in now.
That place has come in to the year.
You can, yeah.
It's not a mandatory thing, but yeah, whatever it should see.
If someone talks about mini-PC, I think they're meant for a US bill.
What?
I don't know.
Mini-PCs, how about the 50 windfall?
You can crowdfund...
Well, they get crowdfunding every single time.
But really, they release plenty of successful devices.
And there's a finger right now on Indiegogo.
And that's going to be absolutely amazing, I think.
It can play...
Maybe not PS5 games, but PS3 and all that, sure.
So it's quite a few TA games.
You can also use a mini-PC with a keyboard.
Got some of these devices.
Dual ones from Paths as well, myself.
Did you say that was by GPD?
Yeah, there's a campaign going at the moment.
I mean, they get a crowdfunding every single time.
But really, they release a several devices.
So when I crowdfund this dashboard,
I would worry that I'm spending over 1,000...
Over 1,000 pounds, actually.
Because I believe that will come from no problem when it's time.
And yes, it looks very good from the hardware specs as well.
Like, it's really improved between the original ones as well.
So I've got the original.
Hello, Ben.
Many were into the GPDM there.
The GPD game, the GPD...
There was a gaming one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The bottom of the GPD has always been from at least for me.
It's been the price.
They're really cool looking devices, but they're super expensive.
I don't remember how much my previous ones cost.
I feel like this time it was expensive.
But on the other hand, it's got some of the best hardware in that particular device.
So it kind of makes sense.
Yeah, there was the GPD win.
That's the fourth one, I just said.
There's been the GPD pocket wasn't too.
There's been a GPDXD.
There's been a GPD Micro PC thing.
And there's been some other things a little bit as well.
Or updates.
Or the Mac.
So it's the biggest greed or something.
There's all good stuff.
All that is from Hong Kong.
I had someone going like, oh, I would buy a thing from Hong Kong or China.
I was like, you know, that most tech is made in China or Hong Kong, yeah.
Because some people think it's antitrust.
People think it's rustic for me, maybe.
But when that actually that guy was saying, like, the Nova.
And I was like, you know, the Nova is from China, yeah.
And then I'm looking forward to something else as well.
And I'm better get this time when I'm going to be annoyed when it comes out.
And I know exactly what that is as well.
It's very quiet.
And if you may have a few people on safe, I think on this as well.
Yep.
I'm also looking forward to another device.
I expect it to be released in March probably.
And I know exactly what it is.
It's just last time around.
I got caught out.
And it was like, oh, no.
It was releasing on Wednesday.
And I don't have the money to buy this because I've seen some money probably at a time or
ever.
And I thought, oh, I did.
I do on the first day, except the next day, it already sold out, of course, in about four
hours or something.
So I demand a lot of hype sash marketing around these.
This particular.
Well, yeah, all the pine 64 stuff.
Very, very over hyped.
I mean, it's really cheap as well to buy any of that stuff.
It is good.
And yeah, they're doing a pine tab too.
So I couldn't get the original pine tab in that.
That annoyed me.
But the pine tab, too, is coming.
And that's basically that bit better as well.
So yeah, we'd lovely to have a pine tab.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Yeah, nice little Linux tab.
Well, it's armed with a pine 64 in it.
Basically.
Oh, and then also there's something else happening.
And I'm very, very interesting.
That's going to happen as well.
And that's the all the boy mini or where it's called yet.
Yeah.
I had the original one might still do.
I think I have a feeling it might be thrown out by someone by mistake here.
Not me.
Oh, it's in a box somewhere because you think they're so small.
They're like card size gaming.
I had a Tetris thing as well.
I hope it's there somewhere, not being chopped out.
It's doing a new campaign where all the games will be 300 games on these little devices.
It looks really interesting.
All the boy mini.
And it's already crowdfunded really because lots of people have put money into that already.
So that will happen as well.
And you can play the play.
And that's where I can play the like interesting game or something that's absolutely tiny as well.
What were you saying that matter?
Well, why was angle there?
No, I was mentioning the P800.
It's a quite nice little box.
Most of the P800's.
RPI 800.
Hey, that's a pie.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, and that's a keyboard.
That is the right thing to buy for it.
No, this is a competitor to the 400.
Oh, right.
This one.
That's one that was put by the orange pie guys, isn't it?
I think so.
Yeah.
It's an orange pie.
Yeah, it's got a parquet.
Sorry, sorry, but that's a pie that is not cool anymore.
You'll look at pie in 64 and that.
They're all good.
They're all sort of their own purpose.
The orange pie 800.
It's really $108 on Amazon.
The Rock Chip RK-399.
Six cores, six threads.
1.8 GHz processor.
Four gigs of RAM.
64 gigs EMMC.
You think that's impressive?
Well, small device.
Look at the old ribeye mini.
I was just talking about it.
We're like, really?
You can do that on something so small.
You can play with games and whatever.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I just thought of something.
Yeah, 2020, 3rd year of most, I think, a lot of confidence is being back on for dinner,
other things, which is going to be lovely after the COVID pandemic, yeah.
If the other one's coming up in Brussels, so pepperies that'll be good.
Yeah, I was going to say, here are the states.
I know the couple of conferences have already opened up.
There's more than two just came from Ohio.
Yes.
I think in the summer, there was that was itself Carolina, didn't it?
Yeah.
The weather is cool.
The American thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, those crazy Americans.
It's like here.
There's Fosdom, massive Vegas Wall in Europe.
And that's going to happen in on the evening of February.
Yeah, that's really cool.
And that's it.
It's definitely recognising it's massive.
These are, say, 8-5 out of the people game.
Now they say 8,000 people.
There's a official way to reach them.
That should be massive.
It'll be really popular.
The beer event will begin on the Friday.
And there's all kinds of talks and everything stands on the weekend.
It's just amazing.
There's also a little high five show in my city that should be coming back.
Well, I'm not little.
It takes everyone at the hotel to speak.
So I'm kind of looking forward to going to that, the end of February as well.
Well, I'm not going to have money to buy any of these expensive beakers personally, etc.
But it's nice to go around still and listen to things and stuff like that.
Or it all sounds mostly the same to me, even though that one's more expensive than that one.
And there's a little bit of home cinema or something, probably as well.
Yeah.
Is my first talk down now?
I don't know.
I heard you.
Is that count?
All right.
I think I'm going to step away for a little bit.
Get another cup of coffee and see what the family is up to.
I'll still be around monitoring things.
But if the net minor, you have my email.
If there's any, if you're around them, there's any issues just ping me.
Are you awake, sir?
Yeah.
Maybe not later.
Hey, yeah, I'm here.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you're around and you know it's any issues or anything, just send me a quick little email if you could.
Moving on.
Should do it.
All right.
Yeah.
Good.
You too.
I have.
I think my first talk to you.
You still hitting that minor.
Yes, I am.
I said, I don't know if you heard that.
I said, I said, I guess that the last to keep it going for a bit in the way, otherwise it would be white noise.
Yeah.
Like nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess I got to that.
Well, what did you say second?
What did you say?
I didn't hear that.
We're going to be filling in the breach.
Yeah.
Well, whether they might as well.
I was going to stay also for about an hour or so, I think.
And then pop off myself and then come back.
So that's why I was thinking anyway.
Well, I might try to stay as many hours as I can.
And that will be interesting.
I might try and keep the after show going as well.
It was me who kept it going.
Got going so long ago the year anyway.
Well, five years ago.
Five years ago.
Four years ago.
Like, try it this year and see if.
Oh, sorry.
Next year, 20, 30, 40, yeah.
Let me see if we can keep it going and break the old record.
That'll be funny.
I think it means I'm pushing.
I think it's getting stuck with us to talk.
Laptop.
I think this means a little push to come.
Yes, it seems a little stuck.
Yeah.
I think it's because there's a laptop or a button down or not.
Maybe that's what I should do.
Actually, even though it's a little bit down then.
But I didn't want to talk.
So.
It's my bad.
It's a nice idea there, isn't it?
I should talk.
And then you basically.
It doesn't.
It doesn't pick up.
Because you when it's not on.
So.
Do you want to marry.
Are you that minor?
Yeah.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
A little.
Yes, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, we fell for Boston yet.
The.
The.
Riches Talman, please.
Yeah.
You know,
All the.
Actually, it's within a whole lot of around the.
The free social.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are a copy of their source order to do the same stuff that makes up most of the
free-dose project.
Very free-dose, okay, I was like when the old dust nonsense and then it's proprietary,
you know, but yeah, there is that free-dose project as well, that's true.
The one that, the one that never hit off properly, well, out for, not short as number,
I'm not looking right now, but react to OS, you know, that could have been something
more potentially, I think it's just lack of developers as well, and it's obviously
complicated project and doing the open source window basically.
Yeah, it's really well, I can have it all the day, free-dose, free-dose, free-dose,
very well for pure-dose application.
It doesn't have to necessarily have to support Windows, free-dose.
No, but I haven't been going to stand that for a little bit for a while, they're trying
to have them in words and all that on it and they're causing a crash, didn't they?
Well, we are, we are, we are, we can put a product, but they're, they're going to
pretty shake over wine now a bit more as well.
Actually, wine, from a product standpoint, is far ahead of one.
Oh, there are many open source windows.
Modern Z-left channel and disconnected.
Wine is, yeah, wine is pretty good, really, for Liz.
Yeah, wine is quite good for it.
And then there's also, could we visit and play on Linux and things that use it as well?
That changes.
Well, I think, between we, the code, we, and the people working on the steam projects,
a lot of the translational errors are getting quite good.
But really, desktop Linux should dominate the desktop market as well, but it doesn't,
because, well, I think, I think, I think it's really because people just don't care enough
average people, even, even people that know that windows are a bit, not the best.
And then some of those will go to Mac anyway, so it's like, well, yeah.
Well, well, a lot of, a lot of it is, is the people who want to have a little room,
wouldn't do it forever.
No matter how good, liberal, how long it is, the conversation is used to the other
micropower.
Well, in a way, yeah, well, I had, I had that debate with one of the main, at the time,
or we'd be quite no conical, slash, a bunch of people at the other event.
It was on that Sunday night, late at like 4am, and after people living here,
in the England, England, remember sitting there, and the last debate was about
Microsoft Office, these open up, well, not open office, but in a liberal office, yeah,
these, and which is really the best, which is really better.
And he was saying something like, oh, most of office might actually be better for certain people,
because the rest of us are going like, liberal office is good enough for most people,
because it could do both things, and, yeah, people get locked into that as well,
and somehow I'm not willing to try alternatives, and it's the same with windows,
they, well, if you go, it's scary to change operating system, why would you not?
Did you hear that?
Yes, I do, everything.
Yeah, no, actually, it's just, I've got to talk to play it off a bit, but
I assume as long as it's blue lighted, that means, yes, I'm on,
although sometimes I've already done it off, really, but,
no, yes, this stuff.
That's a very, very problem with Wimbledon.
Oh, you have to go through a whole reconfiguration range to change,
even if you were to push off.
Do you hear me now?
Yes, I do, yeah.
Oh, um, all right, now I've got to make a choice, I think.
I either just, remember with not responding, you may choose to wait a short while for it to
continue, or force the operations to quit entirely, force quit away, I've passed wait,
well, that's on the recorder, I was from the main recording, but I think that's
something you can say to anyone, if I press force quit or guilt, I'll lose that,
and I'll lose the channel, we can come back, but I think I'm going to lose that anyway now,
because it's giving me this error message on top of that, which is a bit frustrating.
I'll come back, I guess I'm going to do force quit, and I'll reconnect, I'll rejoin them,
so I'm going back, I'm just, I'm assuming you heard that as well.
Yeah, this is annoying though, it's sort of crashed on me, but it's not properly, but it's,
but it has, you know, it's crashed really, okay, force quit, here we go.
What are you talking about top off?
Well, I guess it's time for me to greet most of Australia, happy New Year,
Melbourne, Sydney, honor area.
That's the yummy.
Yes, I can, I'm just trying to get a proper clock, I think we've been off now.
Let's say again.
I'm trying to get a proper off the EMG clock.
Well, for talking to them, it's all, actually, actually, yeah, we've been on power,
so we are at, I mean, I mean, we are at 12.06 GMT, UK time, and that would mean that somewhere else
has gone to New Year, except I think they were that, where that is.
Well, this is corrected greetings to a small region of Russia, martial islands, and
another, who not full tea, yarn, taroah.
I'm doing lists somewhere, right, good.
Yes, well, come to New Year, those places, well, there you're not on this talk after,
you lose people, they think, and you're not listening to it either, so what a shame,
but that's how it goes.
Well, there are links to the show notes on the hacker public radio website.
Yeah, as he put them up already, or?
Put up the framework of basically the time zones.
Right, now it's good.
I think we were a little ahead of time.
So yeah, when they were, this was a little bit early at the moment,
fact, those places just now would have probably been really the first ones to go into New Year,
but because it was a medical smell, someone moved forward,
it was a very last time into the first time zone, and then we just, they, like,
some of the time as well, it became, like, 16 hours ahead of GMT or UTC,
instead of 12 hours ahead, and then also, I think there's only 12 hours going back,
but it kind of shows that we've, even that, we've messed it up to 20, the day of 24 hours
across the world, we are humans, we've even messed that up.
Congratulations, we've just wrecked our own clocks because GMT or UTC is supposed to be in the
middle of all the time zones, really.
Well, it does mean we get the two extra hours on the New Year's show, so I'm not comparing too much
rather, and then we'll be back to you.
It's a nice reading day in England, well, well, I am.
I might pop out later, get you a shop, and I'll see what happens to that nearby, but
nice, terribly raining-looking day, the weather where that
is, is, I don't know, we'll tell us right now.
It's a weather like you've had in that moment.
It's trying to decide whether it wants the rain.
It's in the high of 40s, Fahrenheit.
Oh, yeah, you do Fahrenheit.
It's, ooh, I'm going to look at Google that, I think.
All right, it's 12 degrees C, O, C, you see not Fahrenheit, you hear?
So yeah, it's 12 degrees C, apparently outside, whatever, that's not too bad.
Put that across the race winter as well, but it'll be a little bit chilly out there.
This is going to get probably quite active later.
It's just early at the moment, didn't you, yeah, show?
What district are you that, well, it's, yeah, classic question.
What district are you that blame on?
I'm running mostly, uh, Linux Mint, XFCE.
Oh, um, yeah, they're XFCE, and they're really going to that.
It's okay if one is.
Looks very old, though.
This is the name too, or mate, well, it's weird, they wouldn't do.
Well, but then again, I'm, my history goes back, uh, to a lot of DOS and Windows,
and early Windows, and even earlier than DOS, CPM, um,
let's see, see your whole school, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, uh, I had an account on a Unix machine back in the 80s.
Yeah, we, our system drive was an 80 megabyte drive,
and uh, it was about the size of a small housing.
Well, about like, open box.
I've seen that.
I mean, there's even someone, uh, uh, that was like,
crunch bang, I used to run them.
People at that, but, uh, open box is like,
well, black screen and you right click and you're a menu,
and that's about it.
It seems from what I've seen.
Yeah, that was, I, I had to work with open box, but I,
I didn't have enough, uh, Linux experience to configure it properly and everything.
That's one of the things that I'm setting up, uh,
virtual machine hosting at home so that I can experiment like that.
Yeah, I guess it can possibly be configured a bit more.
I don't know, I just sort of be married, basically.
I know enlightenment can be, like, enlightenment can be fiend and things,
and it can be like, whoa, okay?
Well, I'm, I don't like, I'm coming in from a more amenable arrangement.
Uh, if I bought, right?
Well, I bought, if, if I'm bored, well, I'm bored sometimes or whatever.
Why do you now?
And I might be, I may not be the only one to be fed, but, uh,
if I'm in GNOME or GNOME, but I'm doing 4.3 at the moment, really.
You know, I've done it, but all GNOME free can do the same thing.
I think, I can just hover over and get activities and just see it move my windows around.
Or, I mean, click around on the menu for shutdown and Wi-Fi.
And it's got that bit of bling in there, but it's not, it's not over.
It's not too much.
It's actually quite, so there's quite a lot.
Or all the, when we, when we see the windows, when you press the,
the various programs that are on the thing.
But yeah, because it doesn't, yeah, it doesn't,
it hasn't overdone me, the eye can be.
And then people can get extensions, they'll redeem it,
and if they really want to.
But yeah, it's quite nice.
Well, my active Linux experience started out
when I jumped from Windows 7 with an aftermarket multi-screen kit.
So you can have more than one monitor on your desktop.
I know something Linux has had for a long time,
but that was Windows and Windows has been pretty crippled in a lot of areas.
The Markpal desktops, yeah.
Well, the two desktops screens as well,
and I think that's not what you meant.
Yeah, I think you meant actually with Markpal desktops.
So, yeah, I mean, well, there'd be even how they're back in.
Or some user interface, probably back in 1993,
but you're going to have to live it in Linux.
And then Windows suddenly got the feature in my,
completely with Windows Vista, actually.
And it was like, you can do that.
Well, I was running Windows 7.
Maybe it came to an update, I don't know.
I didn't know it as a native feature.
I had to buy a secondary package,
or at least I believed I had to buy a second package.
Yeah, I was a bit like Clad Bros.
Now, I remember we had NetCaptor in Windows,
and you, well, I think we should download that.
It's still free.
One of those fake IE shells,
not really, they go and you didn't say explore underneath,
but they did have tab browsing,
and tab browsing did not come into it.
Oh, they were so delayed with that as well.
When this explorer got tab browsing,
it feels like version 7 or 11 or 3,
whereas Firefox and Chrome and so on and all do that.
Yeah, well, yeah, I started out.
I had early AMD their first on-chip integrated graphics processors,
and I could run a couple of screens
off of that processor,
or I think I could run one using
DisplayLink video over USB.
But it is all that's just a hobby time,
with passions, and something that you have to think about,
or have you had jobs in it as well,
or you're getting paid?
Mostly a passion.
For many years, I was home taking care of an aging parent,
and the situation was the computers helped me deal with the situation.
Passive things, Dave, you know.
I would be looking for work,
but my mother was very critical of any cut.
Well, she made it rather difficult to look for work,
because if I had gotten a job,
I could have moved out.
She would have lost her house staff.
Yeah, that's true.
If you go look after someone like that,
then view to the way to spend time using me as well.
Well, also, my narrows were at such a state
that I went to our state rehab organization,
and they uncovered that I have a mild case of autism.
And Mike, you started that topic of autism.
I was going to, I wanted to say something to do with.
No, actually, I was looking to Mike.
I don't want to talk about, I'll hate you if you are this year, part of me.
And so, in that case, if you have somebody else
who's just joined or channeled,
if they're coming in here, but either way,
while I was thinking, I'm trying to wonder a speech about this,
because I do like public speaking,
and I have to do toast classes on the earth.
And I have to do, I've got music speech,
music and rock, and then I'm doing the STEMs,
Dean, the Stream people, basically.
And it's about open source and stuff,
and how only seven minutes,
but I want to do a speech about some of those stream passion
and interest that certain people have in the house
where it comes like open source for example.
And, and they're doing this as hobbyist,
and they give up all this time.
And, you know, like, some of the projects are tiny,
but important sometimes,
and like, there was Shell shocking 2014,
it turned out that hang on a minute,
encryption on websites doesn't work,
because of this bug in OpenSSL, I think it was.
And, they had to fix that,
and they had to sound that was volunteers working on this,
doing it in their passion, and in their free time.
Then Apple, Microsoft, Google were like,
oh dear, we need to get together with things like this,
I think we need to sort of sell.
And, there are people who kind of like,
give up their lives to do software,
like this, for example.
They don't want to, they don't bother with,
that like, having partners and things will some do,
but a lot don't really bother, they sort of go,
I do this project, I do this,
this is what I do, this is what I care about.
And then the debate is basically,
you know, is that autism as well, possibly,
or as purpose?
So, if you see what I'm saying,
they're having that stream passion,
waiting to give up, and just do only that,
or for the most part,
everything else doesn't matter, just something.
Well, I have asked for groups,
and, yeah, some of it is,
and some of it is just, well,
socially, some people just don't adapt
to the rough and tumble of social intercourse,
and they find it much easier to go in
and deal with the computers,
or whether it's model-rounding,
or keeping fish, or painting, or whatever they do.
Yes, so I've got some as well, apparently,
but by actually not, I've got an old diagnosis
of age 14, believe it's cool, but it's so long ago.
But in some ways, that you can use it as a free advantage,
but I think, I think, in reality,
a lot of the tech people, or STEM,
I'm going to say, science, tech, engineering,
and mathematics, right?
STEM people do probably have,
at least some autism,
or aspects, or something,
like, you know, a little bit,
I mean, may not be diagnosed,
it might just be a few traits here and there,
but yeah, and like, these are the inventors
and things as well.
So, if that's, I mean, maybe that's a good thing, really,
but obviously, the social, usual people
are not going to fully understand that,
and stuff for one standard.
And then you might have problems
with the social side, possibly in certain situations,
and it's hard to socialise,
or haven't had certain experiences
when other people usually have them or whatever it is.
But on the other hand, there's all these amazing projects
that, you know, enough of like,
what opens all this, it allows you to contribute,
not just to the programmer,
you can be marketing, if you want,
or quality assurance, or graphics,
or translation, or documentation,
and it doesn't really matter who you are
because it allows you to get involved and do things,
and it's the same with these conferences when they happen.
It doesn't matter that that person is working on whatever
and I'm doing whatever, you know,
it's just, it's like, they're with similar people, I guess,
and it's nice.
Because in getting a general society,
most people are nothing like us.
STEM people, I mean, they say, yeah,
where would people distinctly understand
tech enough of how I said earlier, and things, and, yeah.
Not any response to that.
You're still here, yeah.
I'm still here, I'm just trying to get the time,
since I haven't been able to find the Zulu Club online.
Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But is a stream-passionalism for Westburgers?
It's like, being able to totally,
or mostly focus on one particular thing,
for example, something with rate of open source, right?
And that's the main interest,
that's the main thing that someone cares about,
is that, and they're not even getting paid for it as well,
a lot of the time,
is that autism or Asperger,
or related to Asperger,
or not as a question, I want to ask.
So, there are always people who are just wired that way.
Autism does part of it,
because of our different perceptions.
But also, there are introverted people
where the purity of mathematics, or computers, or what's have you.
I found computers to be a refuge back in the days of basic,
in fact, it's basic on a many computers.
I was growing up in a nasty alcoholic household,
and with the computer stuff,
I always thought of it.
I was pushing their buttons instead of them pushing mine,
which was empowering as a teenager.
I mean, college, well,
it's a bit different in UK compared to America,
it's not the same thing quite.
Let's say education, yeah.
College was a bit difficult,
education, school, etc.
But then, computers was a way to escape and internet as well.
And then I find out about IRC and things as well,
and it was like, it was like a different world sort of,
and it was a way to escape from where I was going on in the so-called in person.
Well, it's fine as well.
And then I just see it into a cyber space and do whatever,
and it was nice to, especially as a teenager.
And then they make some online friends and things as well.
So I figured, yeah, in some way, there's probably,
I'm not really a gamer, but again with gaming.
I guess the same thing there.
People can escape into the gaming world
and escape from reality a bit,
and stuff like that.
Yes, well, not just the gaming world.
There is a complete world.
There is a virtual world as well, yeah.
There's a system called Second Life
where there's a complete secondary economy.
And when you pay things in the game,
the thing, or you pay for some of the love
to my love, it was Second Life thing.
I think it's quite into that, yeah.
Well, you pay for things.
There are people who make a good living
creating activities and creating things
for the Second Life world.
Yeah, and well, that's common in games, I think, now,
that you can pay for the features,
weapons, or whatever.
You don't have any computer games,
but you actually pay with real money.
And it's like, yep, here you go.
You've got that feature.
You've got that thing now.
Greetings, Norfolk Island, and to Kingston.
Note, we have, we need a decent Zulu clock site.
It's a shame that none of those people
on this podcast are even listening to it.
I was five or no.
This is mostly Europe and America and Canada, I guess,
and maybe a little bit Australia and even maybe.
I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm just kind of listening.
I'm actually in Wallyworld right now
doing a little bit of shopping, so.
Sorry, Hollywood.
I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, but I'm in Wallyworld,
which is Walmart or Azda over there, or what you see as well.
I always see, yeah, yeah, yeah, warm up.
Well, I would email Honky who's going to have to process
all of this audio, but I don't think there's much he can do
because we haven't, because we haven't been given proper clocks.
But who's doing it, Pokey?
We'll see, they're going to carve in August again,
because it's happened last time.
Like months, months later after the year,
show we know you're big about it.
It bears online.
Yeah, they're going to have to just apologize for us
not being able to read.
I think that got to introduce himself actually.
It's not Canada.
He won't just aspire.
He was in here on mumble, spying on us.
Sorry, I'm just kind of walking through super noisy aisles,
otherwise I'd keep responding,
but there's probably copyrighted music over my head, too.
No, no, no, in my understand, yeah.
Sure, they had public place, etc.
That's a warm up and asda.
Yeah, I mean, there was a,
they did buy out asda over here, super market.
However, more recently, it's actually,
they actually sold it pretty well.
Well, they might have once had a share of it still,
something very tiny,
but they sold it off to some like billionaires of brothers
or something that the Indian,
or British, Indian, or whether they are,
but they're billionaires and they bought,
and they bought out asda.
So that's kind of interesting.
And also Morrison, who was the third biggest one
got worn out by Americans,
didn't started to lose market share
and profit prices and everything.
And then the Germans, with Aldi,
have become, which is also an America,
believe Aldi actually,
have taken over as the third biggest,
out of the big full supermarkets in the UK,
Tesco, St. Greece, used to be Morrison's.
No, Tesco, Spain, Greece, asda,
and then it was Morrison,
but now it's Aldi as number four,
which is interesting,
how they got into the,
it got in there, but on the other hand,
there's a so-called cost of living crisis,
where the food is more expensive and inflation,
and the flicks have to be elsewhere as well,
get the gas and the oil and the electric and that.
Yeah.
But it's interesting how the Germans kicked
the motor, where the Morrison got,
Morrison's got kicked out of that.
Oh, they all tried to move.
The food was bought out by Walgreens.
Sorry, thank you.
Our booths was bought by Walgreens.
Sorry, couldn't handle that properly.
Oh, sorry, let's see.
I was trying to get to us booths.
The drugstore was bought, I think,
by Walgreens here, the chain here in the States.
They're booths.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah, they might have been brought out as well.
If I had big brand over here,
yeah, it's very known booths.
The only thing we've warm up there,
and I've been to Florida.
August 2, 5 and 8.
So, oh, I know, I've had that.
But yeah, you can get those, like,
trip, uh, oh,
was it massive, massive ice cream,
type, yeah?
Like, super size,
like, absolutely massive.
It's not here, then, might not.
Yes, I'm here.
I'm just reporting how that our timing is screwed up
because we don't have proper
because I'm on Eastern time,
and I don't have proper translations to
to the Zulu time put in the, in the, uh,
what about, what about the very time and date
don't call me whatever it is?
Does that help?
Uh, I hope, I'll see.
It does, if it, that,
that's the best time all the time,
and stuff.
I believe.
The problem is that I,
I don't need static conversion.
I need a clock that does the conversion
actively.
I need a Zulu clock.
Where is New Year?
Can we Google it and get across?
But yeah, I might miss a few half-hour times
of potentially because of the few,
at least, we'll be free of those
in your house, what, then?
So, let's bring on time and date.com.
I mean, it shows the time zones
and when it's going to happen, things,
and then if that helps to sub extent,
we can go like, next time zone,
pre-restorm zone.
Well, I've got an active Zulu clock.
Thank goodness we might have this straight dog
by 1,300.
So, 1,300 EMT, DCS,
which is 50 minutes,
also, that's 20 minutes, yeah?
Yeah.
