Yeah, so we uh.
So it's about to do that, bobo's dot is a heap, with dashes, we can use it, and it's almost
not.
Yeah, that's after the bobo's dot, we're going to do this, we're going to go to, we get the
main dot.
Well, this is on Mars, so it's a weird thing for you to see, dot, man, it's a pretty old
thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, can I show you something?
Can you do that?
I can't.
You can make it.

And, um, it's Microsoft Review, which is actually pretty slippery in terms of that today.
But, the way it wanted is, um, collaborative project software.
I don't know.
Like, there's a SharePoint board and a SharePoint file.
So, whether it's your browser or...
Yeah.
Very, very overnight.
But, SharePoint communicator and group here are all basically the same thing.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.
But, this is...
We've been comparing this over the last two or three weeks.
Two days a week.
Nine and a half months.
So, we have a DMC of the three servers.
And then, that connects to our wall.com core.
Which, it's on the same room.
But, it's...
They're separating this three server racks.
With team online between the three.
So, there's kind of a giant Cisco 70-500 hours.
Separate on PC, mister.
What was it?
Separate on PC, mister.
Yep.
It's all, um, rather than like the...
All of our stations in our lab are connected to it.
We have a few different servers trying...
trying this stuff off.
We have a server with a...
on...
connected to a couple of cameras that are streaming.
Security.
Basically, security needs to run that.
You get a demo of 100 beats each time.
Um, that was one of the things we didn't end up getting off.
It was...
It was...
It was hard.
It was twice a week.
It was two different sections.
We never worked twice a week.
It was...
And we had to reset more comments,
but I never had a plan to say it.
So, we configured all the routers.
You also have the C1 links.
So, security, everything down all the switches.
Or so, of course, security.
Um, tomorrow's our last day of class,
which I don't really see else.
So, once I get out there,
we start with the DNC.
So, uh...
If you would have any DNC server,
which one that would be...
Then we need DNC.
The DNC server...
Probably wouldn't be a DNC
because you don't actually...
Your rescission...
You know, I don't think...
It means the DNC server.
It means the West server here.
It means...
You know, you have...
You have, uh...
Right on the gate.
You have...
That...
So, but you're not connecting to the data server.
And you go to the website,
and you've got...
The data server is never the DNC.
You don't have direct access to it.
So, you don't have to see it in the DNC.
Yeah.
I'm not talking about enterprise.
Yeah.
I'm not talking about the...
The data region is driving to the West side.
Right. Yeah.
Right. Should...
What should be the DNC?
Because...
Anything that doesn't need external access,
doesn't go into...
Direct...
Direct access.
So, right here, West server,
that's a DNC with reference to database
at the amount of DNC.
Right way here on the act,
they still can make...
So, I have to go over the major firewall
and get to the database.
Yeah.
You're probably going down on the port
that doesn't have access to it.
Yeah.
So, that, you know, only track it from...
Such and such port and such and such.
That's what I've been...
Such and such MAC.
You can get access to this interface.
Right.
Yeah.
I've probably said that...
At the firewall,
then only allow this PC.
Yeah.
It's an asset control.
It's an asset control.
Yeah.
Anything you're providing that down to,
this could be your...
Or this MAC address.
Or this range of IP addresses
can connect to the server.
Or only at this port.
So, that's where this...
I don't know.
But if somebody would have the...
HP server,
then they could actually try words
to...
The database server.
So, if they had the DNC
user...
You know what I mean?
They wouldn't still pull that server...
Yeah.
That's...
And they had the left server
when they would be able to access it.
The database server, because...
But, as you can set your database server
from, say...
The database...
The database server may have dual
purpose and stuff,
so you can set, like,
only database,
black, white, and portion.
Yeah.
And as a black house,
it should connect to it and stuff.
And these...
You can set up...
Yeah.

I don't know what it probably is, but um, serials of Ethernet should be heard that you can basically use it for a lost serial pump over Ethernet.
We've got to go this side of our plastic filter.
Yeah, for example, we'll have less scales, less waste scales on the back before.
Thank you.
And you can, you're serial, it runs if you put a maximum of the serial.
So you put this on there and you stick around the network and not any device on the back, you can ask.
It's like, as long as they have a serial for a box, where you can actually do a pump.
So you can get software that will do a compound work research network.
So that's the device called, and how do you go by one?
Because I've got a couple of old, I mean, really old, large port format, you know, plodders.
There were serial, you know, straight serial.
And it's a pain in the ass.
We have a pretty hard to get these parts superior anymore with this serial.
Right, we can't, but we've decided, I mean, it's just hard to get.
We're near something that you can hook up the serial cable to be light easier.
I'm doing old light ethernet.
Yes, 100 light ether knowledge.
And you can do a lot of it with this serial.
So that's that like the scanner bar.
Those are serial devices.
And it's included more than manufacturing all of this parts.
Yeah, but my question is, are they sold commercially?
Yes, they are sold commercially.
And they cost how much about?
They're like, there was, but that one, yeah, not cheap.
So it's a lot of money.
$178.17.
Same as the guitar stone flush.
Probably not as much fun, but.
But it was honestly so.
It would run Webster that will monitor different variables
or that serial one.
And you can actually monitor whatever's running in Webster.
You have to write the Webster if you don't think.
You know, you can use change settings.
You don't need to find out the language.
Yeah, please.
You know, a good reliable one would be nice.
Let me tell you something.
What do you talk about stuff like that?
Is there any device?
Well, what's it like?
You want to measure the temperature.
Is there any device that actually
can be powered at the end of the day?
Is there any additional?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
What's that GPID stuff?
If you want to get a GPID, it's a general purpose information plus card.
And there's various kinds of software that you can pretty easily program.
It's not only a day in the USV or serial,
and you can use the easy-to-collective data, or some are the same old devices
that will collect data.
And you later collect that document and pull the installation clock.
And there's lots of...
Not lots, but there's quite a few letters.
And there's stuff like that.
Yeah, I'm trying to think what...
Yeah, most of the people that have been GPIDs are the...
For the field-packed flotters.
You know, the general name of that company is...
So long since I've looked at it.
But it's, I think, it's national data.
Or something like that.
Anyone has something like that.
Any of them.
Any of them.
Any conductor, maybe?
No, it's national data.
It's national data.
No.
Some with national and in the word data in the full title.
I have a cap on.
You know?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
And the GPIDs are very solid.
And they're very easy devices to use in the program.
You know?
You know, you can just run GW basic.
And use it.
Just open the port to it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
No.
All right.

Okay.
Violas.
Can be heard hygenic alpha.
You didn't volunteer hygenic alpha.
Yeah, no, wait a minute. I did something with it before.
You know, you don't work flat if they, you know.
It's all windows shows up and it tells me all kinds of stuff.
Now, what is that, what is that actually telling me here?
I mean, you know, it says,
VNCD were free edition for ex-built September 10th,
it's on its own and it's go all kinds of,
it's on its own.
It's the help file, the convention for connecting to VNCD
plans. Right.
Isn't displaying or showing all the options that it means.
So, what does that show up, what does that show up,
what I put on this little thing that says,
I don't know if that's tough,
but it's probably the distribution and some little applet
that automatically runs and makes for VNCD connections.
So, it tries to create with like the default config
and then, you know, doesn't want to do it,
doesn't do it, we don't connect.
So, it does. So, like, this is probably a lot of things
that you do like to do.
And that's just how you are, man.
We're just looking at it.
Right. Right. Right. Right.
And it displays all the options that you can run for the commands.
Or does it come with a loop,
and it kind of plugs into over it.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
But VNCD client program,
that's your kind of collection of all of them.
Oh.
Okay.
If you want to be in gray,
or whatever your collection is presenting,
what's available on the network?
Well, how do you,
the whole Saudi,
two whole Saudis,
got zero comp built in.
If you have whole Saudi on multiple network devices,
it will show up on that,
and you can connect to other devices and play sounds
over your network use.
Right. Right.
Well, I do VNCD stuff a lot
from one computer to the other,
because I don't like to walk over there
and do something like update a virus file, you know.
But I've just never done it over, like, you know,
the end, I mean,
there's ways you can do it through SSH,
you know, and stuff like that.
So, actually, this doesn't really tell me,
this doesn't really tell me anything really that is,
isn't it really any useless?
I already know what it is.
Is that what it's,
is that what it's,
is that what it's about?
Or random software?
Yeah, the Z-con system.
Do you have any service?
I have a DMC client.
The Z-con just started it,
and it makes it available for other,
other client content.
The reality,
got it working for your office.
Right. Well, it's OK.
And the authority made it back up.
Well, you didn't take,
have any interesting stuff,
then really?
Well, you know,
he didn't get that one.
Yeah, it was way more interesting things,
but it's OK.
It's OK for someone to lose that thing,
you know?
Right.
Right.
Right.
We're here again.
Oh, right.
I don't even know if this should be a game,
and it was learned already off it.
Oh, right.
I'm using some thickness.
Look out,
it's more like a mouse.
He was faster to speed a bit,
to speed a bit,
to absolute speed.
I'm going to nimbus now,
somebody in the port.
Nimbus, write that down for next week.
I'm going to write nimbus,
and stuff like that.
What is nimbus?
This is the default sort of,
sort of,
that's not what you call it.
Not right back.
I'm going to get this open off as well.
Thank you so much.
That was nice.
That was just good.
That was just good.
That was just good.
Cool.
That would be a boy.
Anybody else has anything to do with it?
You want to share with us?
Yeah.
I'm just going to mention,
I did not.
Go to bleepoost.com.
This is,
who I use for, like,
web hosting and stuff.
This is a recent change to their stuff.
You can get inexpensive web hosting and stuff.
There it is.
Yeah.
They used to have 120 gig.
I think it was a storage for seven months and one.
And unlimited transfers and stuff.
Very sweet switch.
Unlimited hosting space.
Unlimited file transfer.
Unlimited hosting remains for seven bucks.
Wow.
And that's what I use.
I've been on your back.
I'm sorry.
Look at that guy.
He can't believe it.
He's like,
I used to smell it.
It's really good.
It's true.
He's stupid.
But we're still making money.
Yeah.
They used to do that.
I was just going to store it in the back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
The loser, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, one, zero, one, zero.
Three.
So you have,
you can,
as many of them as you want to register
and as much space as you want to use.
My right says,
under the control panel,
when you log in,
the limit on the,
the hard drives side,
the size still says 350g.
I was forward to asking each button.
So I had to reach that maximum.
I can't actually,
I wouldn't have much contact with that button.
But I was interested in the sheet
that got that magic word right there.
Ruby.
I was out there.
Okay.
Okay.
We just think of Ruby on rails.
There was a group that was meeting
up at that restaurant,
which one was it?
It was lower than it was,
you know,
green milk.
There was a,
several time,
I'm reading there,
there's been a group that,
that said,
Ruby on rails,
the user group
that meets at lunch time,
I don't know how widely they do,
but they look like
they must be a local group.
So,
I actually,
yeah,
now the,
the guy called out
of these groups
in Ruby on rails.
Thank you,
the presentation,
Ruby on rails.
Not,
it's not that they need
there,
and not lunch time,
sometimes they need
there.
I think we yesterday did a presentation
of the,
like,
for sure,
one,
and three of them make
SharePoint shoes right now.
Okay.
Then go.
Okay.
Mm.
I've not actually
been there.
Yeah.
SharePoint
and try
something around
that,
oh,
yeah.
That's what I'll say to
Ruby.
Everyone thought
I was going to tell you
about how so it was.
It's like
there are new packages
that go outside
of Microsoft Office.
Massive,
lowly,
lots of ITD,
probably well,
40 gigabytes of RAM
is saved
for a sit here.
You know,
you can,
you can take all your money
to each other,
but of course,
there's the bottom line.
If that was what it's
$30,
then it would be about $20 back.
You know,
it would be the same thing,
but they could be
understeer,
then you could create
some like-a-
that would be
absolutely.
You should suffer.
$900,
$900.
Kind of out,
$900,
he did.
He did.
He cut it down,
and it worked,
and then you can get
the information
about the individual.
How do you find it?
Copy,
is modified.
Copy, is modified.
No,
that,
no, that,
right with a hand.
Copy,
great because it maintained the maintenance.
What do you find out where I know that?
That's the last thing I know.
Well they...
They are not the guy.
They don't know that.
I just got an ad from Delk and it was interesting to see that they're basically
where I'm configurations are like for six gigabytes now.
Yes, that may be.
Yes, that would be as loud as we could have to be.
But in the running VISTA, you mean?
Yes.
If you're not running a 64-bit version of VISTA, though, you can't use it.
You can't use it.
What?
That's been going the whole time.
It's been going the whole time.
He was.
Yeah.
Now.
It's just not full of VISTA.
What?
This, uh, in all of a sudden, a music starts playing in your head and the bad one.
Yeah, because, uh, it's my...
Again, that's what we're talking about.
About the priority in that thing at the point of working in the recording.
You know what?
Adam is sold me a non-danshi.
Really?
I started using it and I had a few rhythm boxes.
Those are given in the box, too.
All right.
The last time I used that, I had a banshi.
It was, yeah, okay, whatever.
But it's got everything in the rhythm box, though.
And they actually worked together.
They had two glass schools and people working on that.
We're doing a good job.
Yeah.
It was a bit of a problem.
I think they tried.
It was a bit of a problem.
I guess so.
Probably three sources in a lit.
I don't know.
I've got three lit.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew that it, I knew it, I knew it.
I knew that it brought, it was there.
Good transfer my file to my device.
They're nice and easy.
And, a while ago, I had all my music on it with the database rather than this small SQL like Ew conclusions.
The SQL lights..
Well that doesn't make me any year.
I mean, you got to get yourself into a real life.
I don't know if you're going over to the device, but it goes a life record up to speed.
That's really interesting, because we were doing in the music business.
some experiments at work because we're looking at using SQLite application and SQLite was like
after 10 faster mice to all up to language.
This was one of the billion rangers ago.
Yeah, but I don't even know if it might have been version 3 is going to be like,
do you try or do you think that's actually meant?
No, the SQLite is invented as well.
Yeah, well, I think the DB was supposed to be very good, okay.
SQLite is the databases like Firefox, these are all internally for all their settings
and everything that is how they use SQLite.
I heard from the DB, yeah, I was looking to have Doc, because they have Doc and Alex,
Java based games.
If that is Doc and find it.
I don't know if it's more of all of them to be right now, but it's still a resource.
So you can get it, uh, I don't know if it's Doc and find it.
Actually, you've already got SQLite on ROOBS, so that's it.
It's true.
Don't touch it.
Okay, okay, we'll get on through.
Okay, once it's approved, that's it.
Okay.
Just do it.
So we're going to use that.
Just for now's enjoyment, uh, I want to say that right now, we need that zero was really.
That's supposed to be like almost a complete, not complete read, right?
But it's not supposed to be a new, you know, fetching all the other pages.
You must be excited.
I thought you were saying that's like one of the big features.
Run from the crown to the air, it's not going to follow that.
It's not always said something that's why it's so different.
It's because they are going to force you in to create more of a methodology.
Yeah, that's what it's about.
Okay, now you use a sort of quality circuit shape, and then even if you want to create
quite a hundred people, you don't get enough of a lot of traffic out of it, because they
can still lose, they can go back to it.
That doesn't force you to actually catch the exact same thing.
Yeah, yeah, stuff.
Love it.
Love extension.
Uh, that's it.
Those try catches are so important to write them up though.
Try, catch.
I know exception.
Come and ask you all the exception.
You don't need to do that.
You just the exception.
You just catch exactly the same thing.
I don't think.
Yeah, you just vary all your stuff.
It's for the database.
Yes.
I used very writing practice.
So my job started.
That's a good thing.
I read everything.
Well, that's JavaScript.
You just wrap it all of your JavaScript in one big try catch loop.
And that's pretty much it.
Because to get the error occur and give off.
If you're using, you know, some rows of code, you know,
a set of code, you can add this to the code for it.
We just, as long as we want to do that, always a couple of things.
One big try catch loop.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
He doesn't mess with you.
He doesn't mess with you.
He doesn't mess with you.
He doesn't mess with you.
He doesn't mess with you.
I don't care.
And then there was an article about, let's talk about 5.3.0.
So he was more and not.
I mean, the first article was just a statement.
We'll leave that.
Yeah.
The article was more, what it means.
It was quite like the article.
Do they kind of on the set?
He was always 5.
And because people often, they were in with with.
Let's just say in the ceremony.
Yes.
Yes.
And then, it just kind of grew.
It looks like Asian.
It's kind of based off loosely off the curl.
Some idea.
Well, everything's based off of some idea of curl.
B4C.
Curls from C.
Yeah.
And that's from O.
Yeah.
C++ came from small talks.
And Ashley C kind of came from Pascal.
Well, Pascal came from.

You know, this article about, uh, of, uh, Amy, uh, you were, uh, one of these.
And, uh, I guess, um, you've been talking about, uh, you were six, uh, very, uh, uh, next topic.
You know, I would like to just tell you.
Is there any equivalence of my photo in, uh, the Linux that's born has been lately re-reduced with some Picasso?
I, I started to use the selling tool, but they didn't put that in this one.
They didn't put that in.
It started to use Picasso, it's very good.
Uh, because, because it's not hopeless, it's definitely made of Linux here.
Yeah, and I actually, I run it through a lot.
I actually, I look like, uh, one of the Linux's first, uh, the director line.
And if you're super, it's very nice.
And there's some interesting, I've heard about it.
G-E-W-E-N-U.
I don't know, I think I don't know if it's, uh, you put it every time you've known.
Uh, pace, world.
Never about it.
But it's G-E.
So, you have, that's what you have in yours, right?
What?
K-Score?
It looks like it.
Oh, that's not it.
I'm sure.
Oh, like, why do you?
Okay.
It's like there's a need for Picasso for Linux, they have.
There's a need for Picasso for Linux, they have.
Is that crappy?
And you say that?
It's not.
Maybe it's, it's, uh, it's a wide, free package.
So, it's like a foreverable one.
I think there's a G-E-W-E-A.
G-E-W-E-N-U.
That makes no difference.
It's very nice.
And, uh, G-E-W-E-W-E-N-U.
And a spot.
And you've had another spot.
There's a classical idea that if they make a few improvements,
there's just a functionality.
I mean, I think we're happier with that spot.
And you can look across the lines.
This is your backboard seller.
You need a similar thing.
Now, I think that's the first thing.
But, you know, I've waited on those,
although they've worked with a few years.
You know, I've had a whole lot of proving there,
because it looks like one of the few years was very slow.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
That's why my internet all of a sudden,
that's 3.8 seconds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got the other 3.3 over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
That was the best moment of my MOU trying to get
like a better, you know, like set it down to 200 and order it.
Smaller packets.
That's all it doesn't do anything.
Set it back up.
I think that's better.
I think that's better.
But I was trying to tell you, I wasn't so like the answer to that one, I'm sure it was a little bit small, just a few libraries.
There was an article that the Firefox has a head-on which is displaying for 2000 documents.
What was interesting about it was that it was Microsoft who wrote this head-on.
Okay, first word in PowerPoint.
That's the rest of the page.
How does this work?
There was an article called this filter office.
It looks like that I have a July air phase change.
It's not going to be that.
I looked through it and I wrote this book.
What happened for quite a while?
They say it's going to be more of an ongoing thing than a service or an industry chest.
There will be a screenshot for a while, at least like 3.2 or 3.3 release.
Is it that people try to match up with a ribbon?
Yeah, Microsoft did a ribbon, so now they have to do it.
They're going to do a ribbon?
They haven't said what they're going to do.
They're going to tell you about the way it was written.
They're like, oh yeah, Microsoft did this ribbon idea and it really cleaned up the UI.
Are they doing this thing like the UI?
Yes, so suddenly.
Yes.
Oh, it's closed.
It was now.
I mean, they should learn from this.
They should have learned to open it up a second.
You don't make that many changes in one shot.
You got it.
Well, three days.
Are you guys ready?
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
We are ready.
Yes, so suddenly.
Yes.
Yes, so suddenly.
Yes.
No, we don't.
They're open up.
They're open up.
They're open up.
That's not going online.
They bring hands from some of the reviews, though all people who have never used an office they like the word and stuff.
It's always one people learn in the first ranking grades.
It does weigh 15 to times and 20 to whatever you want.
You judge the number one.
There's a button called the line that hasSIPS, so they organize the system here before we go.
So they do the test separately.
You say it doesn't work, but your group does do the same.
There is a specific one that is coming in.
I didn't enlarge the vocation of it, but look, this is just a part of it too, it's bigger than that, but it's got, so who's the real languages?
The word language is starting off, household, 4th trend, November of 1954.
Wow, that was really the first one, there's some of the other ones.
B-O, and I actually turned into cobalt, and then algol, and then lisp, and then the max noble, and then basic showed up, and C-P-L,
P-L-I, P-L-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Let's go with the C-C plus plus. That came from a C-P-L, which came from Algoa as well. Previous to splitting off the task. So we should be creating the C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C
We're walking around with trunks of these things. You know, there's none of the darkness. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high. You can't let's get on high.
That's right. What happened? Yeah. What happened? What happened? What happened? What the hell. What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What problem? It's okay. May I get you a second? Okay. May I get you a second? Yes. May I get you a second? Yes. May I get your second, sir? May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get this. May I get some WHAT? May I get this. May I get this. May I get this from CYM 186710- Bless you born. May I get this from CYM CYM 18iosity-C3S 515 privet acute rozm notice of the same kind. May I get these from CYM 2100176
plus plus here. It doesn't really list it on this one but yeah the big
basic was we're basically list the algal 60 in portrait and point and that's
really the deli sections of the tree. What did list turn into? List, a scheme on the
list, a little bit of small talks, roll talk to a scheme when we're pretty much
about it. So let us see. See, can you see it comes from algal? Yeah, CPL, which
list is in the algal. But portrait really, out of algal, it really comes from
here really. So portrait is really the the daddy of it all. So should we go on
ever? Basically, it doesn't have any arrows at all. It didn't come from
anything and it didn't go on work. It's one big line, basic. Basically it can
come from somewhere to call it hell. Where do you go to hell?
So shall we move on? Thanks. I'll say the copy of that. Anybody want a
printable PDF with 150 things like that because I'll give you a URL for it. Yeah,
this one's fairly good. They post it and put it up here. This one they said they
were actually giving it out a copy of this for a while. This is from Hooraylee.
Oh, Hooraylee. That was sort of the whole thing. Oh my. Yeah, this will show me.
All right, yeah, I'm done. There was something called Psalm 1.0 and it was sort of
over there with the height of it. They represent what points were in the
game. There was nothing mentioned about that. But you know, if you buy a thing,
if you go through the right now, it won't give you something. Yeah, and it was
I do. I do inside. In that problem.
Some were 60.
You do see that it takes you out. Ten of the best songberg add-ons because it's
only used well. Ten of the time. Yeah, so you have to pick and choose.
Go right to the end. I actually don't know. Those pedals are pretty good.
That's pretty easy.
I just can't do. Someone turns out maybe there's never.
The answer being that I can't use it. You know, I like to have us
integrated with the other side. But it's not boring. I, as I said, you, you've been
searching for groups, so they came there and said, oh, yeah, this is a song.
What do you want to do with them?
I think it's amazing.
This is a really good question.
It tries to make you more self-driven in LA.
I think it was even a plug-in that you could set up a website.
Like if you were to see me check out a lot of the products that you basically
want to use to impress us.
You know, you're going forward.
We're setting you down.
What do you think about it? These are services which we, well,
kind of might not be able to.
But we started as a, as a, as a blog on the big people.
That's amazing.
It's a habit, right? You're creating a lot of contracts.
A lot of contracts. I bought it.
A level of free, syndicated fee.
What it does, it looks like you've come to the website, you know,
before some artist that you shall see.
We've actually scraped through the website and said, there are three songs.
And you can listen to it in that moment.
I think Chair Ross here, out there, out there,
out there.
They must be where you.
And there was a book that starts at the Conjunction Management Systems.
And he would talk about all of the things that I do.
And he would talk about you money, don't be a lot more personal.
There's a, there's a very low amount of press risk.
It's a positive advantage.
But I think the job actually, and it's all here, to the left, that price.
There's a community addition.
There's a, it's a big addition.
There's two people around here.
He's published.
And he never saw a price too.
That work does too much.
And then Ross, soon now.
Or Ray, soon now.
Ray, soon.
They're saying that the potential of,
they call it like, what are you holding to your content?
It's your own publishing house.
I don't know, I don't know if it's for publishing content.
But it was, I think it should be.
If you are willing to pop, you have a bunch of people are doing work for us.
And there was a, there was a module.
What do you think?
That's one of the things I really like about you Ross.
Is that as the ability, it's here, we have this add-on,
you can make a trope app of simple strips.
Or you can just basically, you click on it to give the database a name.
And your name and password will put create.
And the web app creates a database that sets everything up.
You tell us what the rest of you are doing.
And then you can edit it all.
You don't have to manually edit any scripts or anything else.
Create a database for you.
It's just moving within a matter of a minute.
It's like, you're going to be a bus blocker,
you're going to be a blogger, you're going to be a blogger.
You're going to be a blogger.
It's really like a book.
A book, a book, a book.
Oh shoot.
I can get rid of my ass for what I just do, guys.
It's stupid.
What is your opinion of the video classes?
I can track your stuff all night long.
I think that's what I like about that.
What do you think of the old 26-odd?
I don't know what you're asking about.
My skills, connections in the university.
You know what we want?
Probably get a better speed than you think.
There wasn't much more to see it downloaded.
It had 400 bytes per second.
No.
It's way too big now.
It only takes a little while.
200.
What's your Galaxy?
26-odd.
I don't know what I'm going to explain here.
How does that work?
I don't know.

I have a heck of a sign with the data in this litres...
Myself.
Myself.
Myself.
Morality decided on something else.
Morality decided on something else.
Morality decided on something else.
Morality decided on something else.
Mority decide on something else.
Mority decide on something else.
Maybe it's okay for them.
Yeah?
Our door is the professional one.
But what is our door?
Is it in the seat?
Yeah.
The seat is, I think, the seat plus plus me.
It's a true professional.
It's like that.
For the school.
For the multi-track or audio recording tool.
The DAW.
Yeah.
Is it a audio or a station?
Yup.
Okay.
There was another article that was about something
you want to see from now.
Which I was unsure what it was.
But it's supposed to be something on panel.
What is that?
So it's huge.
It's large, really big.
So it looks a lot like the next menu.
So you can look at the thing you can't look at.
Yeah.
So I think it's because here you are,
and then you look at the old car,
you're doing told on an area of obligation
that they can use all of this.
No, that's not.
It's always in front of it.
Always on top.
And think what it is, is that it's an asset.
I think that's what it is.
And that's it.
We probably don't know.
See, will it really click and expand it?
Or does it seem a bit blanking?
I think it's just combined with what I need to say.
We have the menus that are already in here.
Yes, it's just not a menu.
Let's just throw it all in one panel and be done with it.
Yeah.
So it's like, what are they like?
How do you sell it somewhere in that area, actually?
I don't like it here.
It's very easy to fly, but it's here.
This, that's the end.
That's the slide button right now.
And I just keep my top 10 for granted.
And then I put it up to the full panel.
So I think if you don't have that,
you can go ahead and take the stuff and use it.
And then after a simple loan,
I think you're off balance.
People listen to everything on the site.
This is like my resolution.
This is how we're doing.
Good, I'm looking forward to it.
So I'll panel up through your shirt.
That's along the top.
You know?
I'm going to put it all on the top.
Put your panel on the side.
Yeah.
The screen's wider anyway.
I need a real estate.
Panel on the side.
Do what's for you?
I need to look.
Do what the door is used to do.
And make your panel on the bottom like 48 pixels tall.
And you're running the top panel and you're set.
I don't really like the panel on top, panel on bottom.
Why don't we get speed as well as we expected.
And especially since our screen is already super wide.
First thing I do is I take the bottom panel off.
I'll take the bottom panel on the side of the bottom.
So much space is wasted on the top of the bottom right here.
And everything is vertical or an empty one.
So you're only using, you know, our new screen this way.
And the rest is all this way.
So then you've got all this crap on the top of the bottom.
Well, we have that amount of article.
How do we still end player and ultimately get access?
Even the DVD system.
Oh, that was already about handbrake.
And that was the point.
Okay, his handbrake is not dripping DVDs right now.
So what is the problem?
Because, because you see the oscillibrary.
And the oscillibrary needs to have a really deep space.
Yeah, the nice thing to handbrake is that it already has the predefined form.
Yeah.
You know, so the rest is, I'm going to give you a library.
I'm going to give you a library.
Listen to that.
The defender idea is we put out the cases.
Okay.
So now, handbrake will no longer be able to use.
Not much.
Not much of a PLC load.
No, a PLC load.
And you know, that means maybe they'll also be able to delete these pieces.
And they said they're all blind.
They're all blind.
Yeah, we know I know what that was for some reason.
They probably still have other versions.
We go there.
Yeah.
We see all the version used for that.
So I'm going to put it on the back.
What is the other one?
What is the other one?
What is the other one?
What is the other one?
I don't know.
I had none of them.
So.
And all the math.
Well, the math is the same.
You know, PLC, right now.
Do you have to get over the cases?
And they ask.
I don't think so.
Because they ask.
Probably.
Why are you working with me?
And just, right, you can drop down.
