Okay, so how and welcome to this week of OpenClear Early Mixed Here's a group today is Thursday, November 13th, and we are without internet again.
Just because we like it, we like it without internet like that.
We're old school.
We are old school, yes.
Internet is for losing, where is it?
Yes.
Actually, what we like to do, we like to take the packets and we like to hand deliver them.
That's what we do here.
Because if you want to be real mad, that's what you do.
It's at the station point where it's in secret.
That's exactly.
So shall we do our two minutes of pain?
Well, ice.
Very nice.
All right, I'll start off.
I am scary.
Recovering Windows user?
Yeah, I guess something on that.
But I installed the new Ubuntu.
Actually went pretty good.
Nothing.
No big A. I'm sorry, anything.
So I was getting my programs up and going and stuff.
I got to really work and took my PDF files.
Don't see the work right.
I don't know what the deal is, but I'm going to use right over them.
I just get old ones for an instant and it just shuts.
There's no information there.
In the worst case, you're going to install them.
They'll be after that reader.
They got a Linux version of that.
Oh, they do.
Okay, I'll try that.
But I was used like that.
IBM?
Yes.
In the worst case, we need them.
Yeah, I'm working my own one.
You know, my own Linux works just fine.
So I don't know what I got.
I must have some set up wrong.
But I played a little bit with that.
X, B, what's called?
X, B, M, C.
X, X, X.
Box, B in the center.
That's kind of cool.
The only thing that confuses me is when you're playing a video back,
the sound is way out of line with what's going on in the movie.
And they got this audio offset.
You know, it's a time adjustment thing.
Why do they choose to do that?
That must be something you say.
Something like that.
Yeah, but if they're playing the VLC or one of those other ones, it works perfect.
I see that too.
Some programs are just off.
Yeah, I have a video clip that plays birthday,
and one of those I played at night, so I'm on about 30 seconds.
Yeah, I mean, it isn't even a ball game inside.
That's game 6G.
It's still a big ball game.
That's not actually running in the last box.
Well, you think that's part of the deal, huh?
Yeah.
So, for anyway, I thought that was interesting.
So, I just, that's everything.
Parts, you know, that's interesting.
So, I'm so far, I'm happy with that, H. Duckton.
Yeah, there's some improvements in there that,
I think any other more stuff than this.
I like it.
Yeah.
Cool.
But, you know, I moved up from, I think mine was back from,
it might have been three releases at all.
74.
That's 70.
I think that's it.
That's it, but it's 70.
70.
70.
70.
70.
70.
70.
70.
It'll be a year old then.
I think it's a little bit.
Maybe not though.
What?
Yeah, it wouldn't update on its own if you had the update button.
It's got to make air, it's just a thing of the tool.
Yeah.
It's got to spread to me.
Anyway, that's my doings for the week.
Cool.
Thank you.
Yeah.
How about you guys?
How about you guys?
How about you guys?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I actually gave Myron India a little program called Regis Coach,
which is an excellent thing.
If anybody wants it, I have to know the stick here,
and you can take it.
It has a very good tutorial for it.
It's a little program where you put a particular strain in,
and then you, you know, a sample in,
and then you experiment with Regis expressions,
which shows you what you're actually able to pull out of there.
And then the other thing, by fooling around with something called Tim Lee Wiki,
anybody run across that yet?
I'm throwing that out so that some of you can play with it,
and then I can ask you questions about it.
They can work.
It's basically a wiki as a single HTML file,
and it has what it calls shadow wiki stuff that are not actually visible,
but they help you.
It doesn't have to manipulate wiki,
and actually it appears that eventually you'll be able to...
I don't think that's right.
It's a local HTML file in the start-out,
but they have plugins, which I think all of them
will be able to access it through HTTP,
and still, you know, do wiki things with it.
It's actually quite complicated.
I haven't quite got to the point,
because you need to have a password plug in,
and then you have an upload plug in,
and so on and so on and so on.
And I have to wake you up.
It's making all the way up.
If you would have a wiki system,
and you have to save it through their system,
and we can't use a save from your browser.
But once you get that file completed,
you can email it,
or it'll have to be a name where you want.
And it looks like it's got some potential.
Well, Tim Lee Wiki,
I think you can get it at Tim Lee Wiki.org.
We use that of my work,
and we actually use that.
Yeah, I mean,
it looks like a really substantial thing.
It's just, I think,
it's got a bit of a learning curve,
you know, you're going to have to learn.
It's just a very straightforward,
when you do what it says.
Well, yeah.
That's going to work.
I'm crying.
That's going to work.
Right.
And I'm looking at it as a potential solution
for being able to ask around and shopping lists
off of our local servers,
and we don't have to remember that everything we wanted
to take with us so we can,
while we're at the store,
go to a little home server
and take the shopping list,
and also, as essentially,
a repository for bookmarks,
so that whatever browser I'm using
or whatever computer I'm on,
I'd be able to use the same set of bookmarks from it.
It looks like you can work with that.
The only thing why,
that's great for that.
If you only think what I want to say is that they're
on basis,
and you see that actually the screen is shaking,
and it makes the projector,
projector out of focus.
There you go.
That's over it.
Nice.
Nice basis.
That's great.
So, did you,
it was, it was,
it was, it was,
it's a project code.
Here, actually here,
what you can do looks just,
I think this is a work on your system,
just putting in an untart
and it has a binary in there.
I just wondered if there is, you know,
though, to put it in a grid,
yeah, put it in.
Yeah, put it in.
Yeah, put it in.
You see what it is,
just untart that,
and there will be a,
exactly the file that has it the way,
along with the tutorial.
And then, you know,
you know what you're trying to get.
It's really quite a nice thing.
I mean, the tutorial takes you step by step
through some very complex tools.
Oh, it's just got here.
That's it.
You want it to come up?
I want it to come up.
I don't think so.
Nothing.
Interesting.
Just gonna wait a while.
I'll be, I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be,
I'll be.
You want,
you want it?
Yeah.
Now, mine does that.
Like why is that having,
when it's too,
too touching,
you want it to move?
Do I have it?
Do you have another sign to make for this?
Um,
I'd like to have different view.
I don't want to encrypt, I click on encrypt, I don't want to encrypt, I want to un-mount.
I just double click it, don't you have that, you should be able to just double click it.
Right, double click it and it'll open up in your utility, you want it?
Oh.
Online, all I have to do is...
I know, I know, I want it to, I want it done on your drive.
Oh, yeah, you can't do it.
Sorry.
It's cool, music, but that's just because, I don't know, I used to have music, but at one point I guess.
Thank you.
Cool.
How are you?
I'm ecstatic with this new version.
Does that work?
I got, I got it downloaded finally.
I kind of, I'm a better place and installed it.
I downloaded Adobe Flash Player, which I could not do before.
I downloaded Movie Player, which I could not do before, and it's so easy even I could do it.
I mean, I didn't have to do nothing.
You know, you click on something that says, you want to download these ads?
Yes.
Get some.
Do you want to install them?
Click yes.
Done.
Now we're talking, you know.
Is it where it was working?
No, not yet.
I haven't even looked at it yet.
I wouldn't look at what this other stuff is.
If my wireless goes as easy as that, it's Halloween, you know.
But even if it don't, this other stuff is good.
Now I wouldn't be afraid to, you know, put on my kids computer and say,
here, before, if they got stuck, it's ruined.
So, you know, this is going to be a real competition for Microsoft.
The old version, that was, I mean, you have a real computer guy for that.
But this year, it's just for anybody, you know.
So you think it's getting to regular people?
Yeah.
The only thing, you know, you're saying for your kids, if they need a new computer,
I would say instead of actually installing it, instead of buying a computer at a best buy,
and then installing that on, I think the better route is to actually install a computer with a little design.
Let's say I like to buy it, or buy it from Dell, or from somewhere there,
because then it's your guarantee that you don't always want to work.
So I do want your computer or something like that.
It reminds me a couple of years old.
Yeah.
No one's buying it.
But there's a brand new, they got it, you know, less than six months old.
Yeah, they're Dell's.
Yeah.
You know, an issue with the wireless.
But that's more in my understanding of how to use the computer probably than anything else, you know.
You know, understanding the wound to, you know.
But now, with the gooeyest, it's perfect, you know.
You can't do none wrong.
The only thing is like, once in a while, I don't know what I do.
I don't know what happens.
So I'll just, you know, move your hand or something, and she's gone.
And it's odd, it's odd.
Now, Firefox is everything.
It's just gone.
It's not.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's actually when it's too touchy as far as...
Well, it's too touchy.
What's...
I'd say like what I was doing, so my touchpad was too touchy.
Oh, yeah.
You mean the program closes?
Yeah, the whole thing just goes.
I'll be enough.
I'll be enough.
There's an issue.
No, no, it just gone.
And I'm back to the main page.
The login page, yeah.
Firefox, you know, on and on.
Whatever website it was on.
It was on the scroll, all back space.
That'll kill your ex server.
It will be going into a little restart and full logged screen.
Yeah, when something's going to happen.
Yeah, that would...
You know, this is just, you know, if I'm clicking on something,
I'm pressing Enter and just bam, she's gone.
So it's not all the time.
So you don't get anything like this.
No, no, no.
Wow, then it goes through the black screen.
And then here I have, let's see, my second screen.
No, you don't.
I don't get that far back.
It goes to the login.
Oh, first page, you know.
It's really weird.
Yeah, I don't have that.
And sometimes I can go on the touchpad.
It's back.
And the next time?
Yeah.
You can't bring it up.
You know.
I don't say the ways.
I just had to be patient.
Oh.
Well, it wouldn't have.
Why are you doing it?
I'm completely dead.
I'm trying to solve the static IP address.
Oh, Howard.
I was going to say I checked the status page.
There was an IP address.
Wow.
Well, what did I do?
I didn't do too much last weekend.
I didn't think so.
I didn't do the newsletter.
That's that basic type.
That's what I did.
But I didn't do the newsletter all the time.
So there's nothing special for me.
Well, I appreciate that.
It's really special for you.
I read it.
Well, I'm happy that people read it.
Yeah.
But you want to make sure that people read it on the internet.
I see some, you know.
And the longer the website is up,
I think that more and more people actually stumbled upon and come back.
We have, in a day, we have about 150 visitors.
Is it going up?
It's not going that much up.
It's sort of, you know, from 130 to 150 unique a day.
It depends on the weather.
It depends on the weather.
It depends on the weather.
Absolutely.
Well, you had a lot.
You did.
No.
I have to switch the people who it does.
Because that increases your ranking.
No.
If what?
You know, it's funny.
You do a search for O'Claire users group.
And you still come up with that picture.
When we were sitting in that back room.
Yeah.
I remember we had that, you know, that.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Yeah, still.
It's like the third entry that comes off.
It was the middle.
It was the middle.
The last winter, I think.
Yeah.
It is because it was on a YouTube and it's welcome decks.
That's all what it is.
Yeah.
Cool.
Let's go.
Well, that was about it.
Okay.
How about you?
I hope it's my class.
We're working on a final project.
And I know we need something.
So we should try to study class.
Which is basically building a data center.
We're going to have three.
We have three racks.
I don't know.
The closet, basically.
Each rack is going to be a separate location.
Or whatever.
Um.
We'll have.
Like, I remember a different wind connection between each.
I don't know.
It's just a different wind connection between the racks.
And we're going to try and use some virtualized servers.
Good, right?
Yeah.
Give us the news.
So what did you do this week?
Was I doing?
He's not done.
You have to say welcome.
No.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Me bad.
Next to good.
Next to good.
Next to good.
Were you like this?
Should be.
That's it.
That's it.
It's finished.
Wasn't because you were close to a router.
Shouldn't have had.
Shouldn't have had.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
You know, I wondered, you know, if the cable got me cable.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
chief.
German calculates what needs to be.
I didn't know what needs to be.
I don't think I had to work one time.
Well, comedy.
Talk while checking in the time, my medical told we just
kept this a mic so that we let thiscare out.
We just got a、
You don't get to get new cable there before.
A long cable.
Right.
But instead I get a little bit of room,
I had tried and mess with it.
It wasn't able to get to work in the next step.
I had got it back.
I'm getting at all kinds of things. I got an IP address. I have to get a good signal, but I don't have the necessary.
What kind of cable is it? What do you just do?
What do you love about it?
You know, I think that for today because you have the stuff up, I think you are going to get a projector.
I don't have your website up.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Is there a good photo program in the Linux that you can download that anybody knows about?
Thank you, in the game.
What photo is that?
The photo album?
Yeah, like you got a DVD with photos so you wanna monkey with them, change them in this map.
Huh?
If you wanna manipulate this game,
if you want to have it as an album then,
if you want to crop photo,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, simple stuff. I don't know if the cost are just used up spot
If this I mean you're gonna give my bill over to you. It is overkill for
The cost
Runs in wine
Pretty well
I don't care too much
Just let it do it wants to do
Hello
I heard somebody say that I was mean
The viewers version they
Didn't make updates to it. They've got the videos of CMYK and other color spaces
Including 32 bits are you be colored? Wow
So this slide is actually a default
You know you're using that evolution mail instead, right? I'm using Thunderbird
So I just
Was messing around with the Gmail Google
Yeah, everything I mean I'm running
Gmail through Thunderbird through Thunderbird. Yes, the Gmail's web base store
You
You can actually set out the good off Thunderbird real career your gmail
And that was evolution mail does the same thing right or not
Have a good job filter do they have the evolution I could never figure it out
It's
I watched so what's gonna be the advantage if I use Thunderbird instead of just using the Google mail
Yeah, this is what it is
Yeah, if you log in to a gmail
Yeah, they would put a cookie on your
Yeah, and that cookie will never go away and they will though way where you go even though
I've logged in that's why he said the browser
Even though I said that it still kept the
But why are fast for whatever reason because they have the
Invitizing time contract
Yeah, yeah, you don't mind it
Yeah, all right, that's it's about it
It depends on the certain points
I'm really cookies and I'm gonna say it from anything
Let's see from the internet. They're trying to find you better. Yeah, you know something you don't you don't get fed without cookies
Yeah, there's always cheesecake
There's always a cheesecake
So we still know
So you can just have it set up that
You have I have multiple accounts there
So at Google. Yeah, so I want to three four gmail
boxes, so then
That would be actually your advantage
It'll take all three of them and bring them into Thunderbird
That's where you don't have to
I just
Well, Google says they'll go get your AOL mail or whatever for you too. I don't know if that works
Yeah, they want your eyes fixed to the Google site, right?
They want to read your email
No, actually I did that. That's why I have a glass eye because my second eye is actually cool
Just to satisfy the group with requirement, you know
Yeah, they couldn't sell me anything in a million years anyhow, so I don't give a damn what if you put on here as long as it ain't obnoxious
You know AOL and you want to get obnoxious
Yeah, all what you all what do you need to do is to have this little guy here, you know, that's a gblocker and
Then here down here. It's no scripts and USA. Oh, yeah, it doesn't jobs. It doesn't do anything. No, that's on what
So you
Yeah, so problem
Well that you can if you try this side, but what do you what do you do is then you are saying oh, this doesn't work
I still want to see it then you go down there say temporary allow
If you say oh, I like this website, so I'm going to put in a wireless
Wireless up to some time to train it and all I'm glad where you go looks I'd be going else, so you don't trust it first
You can have your two minutes right now
I
So I was hooking up your wireless was that harder
I mean the installation is what I'm trying to do pretty good
Serial
I would say that I like this release my
Little
I'm actually a better lock in
No, and actually a better one for six or a bit over the 32-bit
32-bit release I've got a lot more bugs than the six
Is this a stick on a window a car? Yeah, I think so
Put it right on my side window think I got to ADT or something
The security
They won't break in
Byron will take some
Even touch a most plantain sleep embossed
I can't even adore us takers, so I like this
Where is we all of these
You ordered them yeah, I just really wanted to
How much do they go the keychain about like she think was like
25 dollars
Like where everything on there because it was coming from
25 dollars
Anything over $1 is expensive they're protein chicken
Oh, so they came from England. Yeah, oh, okay. Oh, that's a giant
I'm trying to like with the door is coming out like I was in the
You're official
Does you get your decoder ring
You know the stone throw foractor ring December
No
Okay, I should give them right mouse
Cool. How would you add them? I don't know what to do, let me see. I saved 5 gigs of
dry space on a laptop or something, if that's something. I thought a bunch of you would
get photos and a bunch of other backup files that I made. That's all I can make.
That's a lot of stuff. I'm done, you deleted my old blitzers movie.
Yes.
I made enough room to put it all together. I didn't install it into the studio. I didn't
find it good. Play with that with the audio. I made it quick, doing this stuff by the
top in the middle of the dual core. I think the best part is much more fun to play with
it. It's a lot of fun to play with. It's a lot of fun to play with, it's a lot of fun
to play with. It's a lot of fun to play with. It's a lot of fun to play with, it's a lot of

I've never got a picture on this kind of table.
You like it?
I've never seen this kind of table.
I've never seen it.
I can't imagine I have a picture on my phone.
I've never seen so happy for the ones who calls in a fancy stuff!
You can't even treat them.
You're looking so pretty!
I've never seen so funny!
You are!
You're looking so pretty!
You're biting me off.
I've never seen so funny!
You are putting on a DONINING looks.
I've never seen this kind of governance speaking up.
Did somebody have any discussion and a topic?
Their product?
Person?
I was very disappointed with my class today.
They were nearly unwilling to use any bone search products.
They wanted to virtualize Winx and Nobel on top of the Microsoft search.
And I wanted to know what people thought I was matured?
A lot of the things it is, what people are used to.
I used to do XYZ and they were saying, well, we need to have another operating system.
We have school, we have a good to pay, and I don't like that.
Well, baby, we will get a Linux there.
Linux campus.
Well, another thing is a lot of your classmates.
They were gamers.
That's all they don't.
They went into computer science.
Oh, I want to play games.
Well, that's the ads on TV.
You see that?
I don't want it over.
University of Phoenix.
Yeah.
Who do you like for?
I like it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's some good guys.
There's some guys who really don't like stuff.
There's some guys who don't like stuff.
There's some guys who don't like stuff.
Oh, there's some questions on you.
But they, you know, they, I give you a lot of questions.
I just want something that's going to work.
I guess I want to do it.
But, like, it's going to work.
And, yeah, it's going to work.
I always want to write stuff.
I like writing stuff.
Yeah.
I like that.
Microsoft.
I don't know Microsoft.
I don't know Microsoft.
I don't know.
It's just inertial.
It's just inertial.
Yeah.
I don't care.
It needs a certiorature?
It could be.
It could be.
The Vitricizer.
It was in the Vitricizer for a while.
Yeah.
I think it's manifestations of the Vitricizer because there's more.
It's more like an artificial.
Yeah.
Oh, not at all.
It's a IRU.
The Vitricizer is an artificial.
Yeah.
I guess that would be a question I would like to see.
And also I'd like to tell you the thing.
You might be wondering because what are you thinking later on?
I'm really thinking.
I have to think about what's going to work.
Thank you for endless effort but I do know.
So that's how you want it to go.
Wait until they add a whole bunch of Microsoft extensions and they'll go down and go quick and just like everything else.
Yeah.
What is it?
Embrace extended extinguish or exterminate your trucks.
Microsoft's business model.
Oh yeah.
Brace extended.
It's really easy, easy, easy.
Pretty good.
It has to be my car.
Oh, I thought you were here without Android.
I was getting a cheat because I didn't know that I didn't have it.
Oh, stuff.
So you feel like your hand was gone.
Android separation.
I like the new page on the Linux when you open up the new desktop, you know.
Okay, it's just clean and clear.
You know, it's way better than the other one.
And it's just a default.
It's whatever came up, but it won't keep it.
There's another plus.
But it's still a problem.
So that's mine.
You know, what they can keep is that stupid picture.
They're intrepid items.
I mean, you look at that thing and it's like, what?
Oh, that problem.
Whatever the hell.
It's like a tabletop.
Yeah.
Who the hell is that?
Who the hell is that?
Who's that?
It's an installment.
It paints somebody a lot of money for it.
Whoever gets it has got a color in line.
You don't tell you that.
It's the branding thing.
But I mean, it's nice to configure something out of it.
You can almost see some kind of an online there or something.

Well, Google.

Yeah.
That's their software.
Yeah.
Android is the software.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Tell us more about Android.
Android.
I've got some new apps for it.
No, tell us more about it.
Like the Android.

Yes, something like that.
And that's the LG phone.
It's a HTC phone.
It's a HTC phone.
It's never really.
HTC?
HTC is a maker on the handset.
Like, tile.
Yeah.
It goes all over.
It seems like everything else.
Oh, yeah.
But it's...
I mean, you know, the selfies...
It's another phone operating system.
It makes a difference.
And it solves everything.
Every other day, it's five or six new amplations
to show up in another market.
So how often do you have to reboot it?
I haven't rebooted it for weeks.
Oh, that's so weak.
I have added for a couple of weeks.
I thought if you are going to compete with it,
with those mobile phones.
I used to have a mobile phone.
I didn't reboot the phone every morning.
But after three days,
we're nearly full of dollars.
We're just starting.
It's starting out.
But this one I have.
Is it my plug in any diet?
I think it's my plug in itself.
It's just...
And I have lit jacks.
Nice.
Nice team of fun.
They've got...
The Java programs, the Java M8.
You get your phones,
I have a simulator here in my playlist,
and we have a friend who had a hard time tripling.
And I have a little job there.
You've got to figure out what you got there.
He's thinking I might be able to play it.
Is he going to die from dysentery?
So you just shoot Buffalo, all sorts of them running around.
You can kill like 5 or 6 and 1 out of your work.
That's the way you are sometimes the longer you don't break an axle and have to spend the
winter in the home.
You don't shoot anything unless it's Buffalo.
That's what we always do.
We shot like 10 or 12 of them, but we couldn't kill the meat, but we didn't care.
It was about shooting the Buffalo.
What was your name?
Buffalo Bill?
Something like that.
I think I like most about this.
Excuse me.
I do use Google for email, contacts and everything.
When I got this, I punched in my username, password, and I had all three calendars I subscribed to.
On my phone, instantly, all my contacts are there, emails, and everything you have to do.
I heard they used the browser to Google it, but it's all on my phone.
Wow.
You saw it on Google.
Some Google built.
And I don't know if it works.
Is that the Chrome?
Chrome.
It doesn't say, I don't know.
It doesn't have flash in those arcades over there.
I think that's the idea that they were saying.
That's why they have Chrome actually.
It has its own YouTube player.
So I know it can play flat.
Thank you.
You can see more dollars changing the tail.
That's a very important thing.
YouTube isn't necessarily flash.
There's two different formats.
For like on phones, they don't actually play video using flash.
They use some other format.
Yeah, they stream it out in a different format.
I don't know if that's it.
It's not flash.
It's just that.
If they actually stream a video, or is it supposed to play?
Yeah.
But I don't have any more information on it.
We don't have free-gaming cell service here, which is the fact here.
Data service for cell phones.
So this all travels over the small, small...
So it's probably...
Yeah, it's like...
As you can get data service, but it's painful and slow.
Where she even is.
If you look real close, you can see the bits going out of it.
They're going out of it.
It's like, you've got a handgun and ready to go to the packets.
They go flying off.
You can kind of see them coming out.
It works.
It's something like you were downloading stuff from my satellite at home.
3 kilobytes per second.
Yeah, that's a little slow.
3K?
Yeah.
I've been looking out these...
I've been installing satellite phones in hospitals.
Probably the spread that we're working on was the police.
There are data connections like 19K.
I thought that was pretty terrible.
19K?
It's like one.
3K is slow.
Yeah, it makes sense.
It's like 19-19-19.
That's a standard kilobytes.
Yeah, that's a standard kilobytes.
They have two.
I see that all the time.
It's like drawings.
19 kilobytes.
Okay.
Oh, wow.
That's a really slow, isn't it?
Yeah, it takes a lot of images.
It's been six games like dialogue for that.
They didn't ever get that, but that's a big deal.
Well, the SDC's right now.
They know it's a big deal.
Okay.
They know it's a big deal.
I'm just...
Wow, that's really slow, isn't it?
Yeah, it takes a lot of images.
Yeah, it takes a lot of images.
It's been six games like dialogue for that.
Yeah, there's 56 games like dialogue for that.
They didn't ever get that, but that's a big deal.
Well, the SDC's right now.
They know it's a big deal.
It says you can only achieve speeds of 52K on a 56K system.
Oh, yeah.
You know, it's got the last frame of the SDC's.
Yeah.
Should I go on the newsletter?
Sure.
Did something or anything?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
There was actually a few articles about Songbird.
So they are going to have a 1.0 release.
Did somebody read that?
Surprise.
Did they get a connection?
I used a game that I wouldn't know.
It was actually a surprise.
Did they get under the window?
No, they got under the window.
At least they didn't get under the window.
You don't know.
He's got the other way.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
I mean, I've got a 6-game machine.
It's the following.
You started over there.
Sit in the 150th game.
That's what I wanted to.
That's what matters.
Did you work like broth?
I see it by student software.
Did you work for handselves?
I think you need to go full recovery, re-effication,
here, more offense.
70 dollars.
I think you need to go full recovery.
Re-effication, here.
More offense.
$70.
$70.
$70.
$70.
$70.
$70.
$70.
$70.
Can you play hog?
No.
That was a-
That was a-
Insege.
Yeah.
I get it.
Sombra.
30 dollars, hop.
It's probably a good firm.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, if you think about it,
Sombra was in development.
I would say this is already second year.
Is it really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even that.
It's pretty solid firm.
I like it that it's cross-platform.
So, you get it on McDonald's, on Mac,
or Linux, and it behaves the same.
It's in your bank.
Banky.
Banky, yes.
So, there are quite a few articles about that.
There was something about that, the Mahi.
I guess that I was trying to Mahi.
So, something that wrote the article about it.
Did you read it?
I didn't.
No.
I'll shut down my mind, sir.
See, the Mahi is just for this today.
That's all.
Next distribution.
Next distribution.
Next distribution.
Okay.
We were talking about that somebody's file was enabled.
Yeah.
D-I-V-I-O.
Somebody is giving money to developers to do this funding.
Somebody's funding.
P-E-G-E-G-E-O.

I don't know, maybe it'll come to a set of motion and this is a crash of like eight times.
Showing the remote desktop and virtual machine and Windows 2000 to connect to work.
That way, work is separate from my PC because I don't want the work that we're touching my PC.
They don't want my PC touching work networks so everyone's happy.
Okay, so is that a set of motion?
I don't necessarily.
Showing people what it is.
Yeah, let's move on.
Let's move on.
I'm happy that they have remote desktop and great.
There was an article, we have a server, obviously we have a server.
It's 2.1.7.
Oh, yeah, I was going to ask you to put it out.
Huh?
Huh? Is the server 2.0?
Yeah, but if you are still using one point series, so then...
These virtual machines are better.
These virtual machines are better.
These virtual machines are better.
They are better.
My opinion.
Okay, let's keep on moving.
That was...
This was amusing before.
If you're running a server in the box, then you hear...
Did you have a server that you need to run?
I'm just gonna show you what she's done.
You need to be running a server that's complex.
So we have more phone and virtual box.
First of all, it's a server faster than I can be.
I can be a server faster than I can be.
Body needs stuff that's a server faster than I can.
And run consists of many of them.
Well, let's start with my jokes first.
I think I should run my box.
Okay.
I don't see what the issue is with the box.
You can run a headless disk like you can.
Yeah, that is true box.
It's just gonna flip.
You don't have to gather 600 megs or 18 megs.
It's generally...
If you go to a server 2, you have to go on a server.
Otherwise, you have to run like a pool.
It's a job that's super good.
Not so good.
Why would you get to a whole town cat installation?
Tomcat. Why would you get it?
I suggest we have more server over the virtual box.
I actually like...
I set up this.
Okay, shall we keep on going?
I think we have only two more videos.
It's interesting to me because I'm going...
Okay.
That this week's a server in a virtual box.
If I would be you,
I would take my...
Wait a minute.
I would take virtual box.
It's on a server.
It's on a dedicated server.
Okay, the next is...
How do you say that?
It's supposed to be...
It's really a big part of...
You don't have to have to have a...
You're telling me...
If you're going to be accessing your server from a different machine,
the points are going to be the...
The next thing I would insert in two is you go...
The points are like...
They're really so slow.
But it's so nice.
Well, the thing is that in one point, one point series,
you actually had to use the...
For the server,
you had to install the GUI.
Yeah.
It was totally different from the two series.
So that's very nice.
And on two series, I had to install the GUI on it.
Exactly.
And even though it's still like GUI,
I mean, my interface by...
Yeah.
Even though if it's slow,
I'm going to use the server through SSH anyway.
Yeah.
So if I need to go there,
well, I can suffer a little bit.
That's what I usually do.
When I say slow,
I mean, if you're running Windows,
it's going to be slow.
I'm going to do a full console page.
What I've got is...
The virtual server I'm going to be at.
I use the virtual box on my laptop.
I use virtual box on my other machine.
So it's the desktop.
But that's what I'm going to use over virtual box.
What the hell are you up doing over there?
Maybe you see our Windows virtual box.
You can use your run,
you can use it.
You can use it.
Yes, but...
What?
You would do it.
I'm going to do it.
Maybe you see our Windows virtual box.
You can use your run.
You can use it.
You would do it.
I'm gonna use the focus later.
Oh, you're gonna be suffering from this.
Naked is all.
I see. I made my own beer,
so you can...
We should understand making your own constant.
You're doing yourself.
This is going to make those little...
A little thing to activate it.
That's what he did there.
Hold it in here.
Yeah, I'm going to go through.
He's going to go through.
Yep.
All right.
Are they?
Yes.
Do we walk ours?
Yes.
Do we walk ours?
Oh, what?
Archlinic?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's true.
We are so proud of having the knowledge of today.
This is interesting.
This is Life Day.
This is what happens.
You reboot and update.
You cannot find your cool Alright you're right.
That's not what I'm thinking about.
Is that hurting one experience.
The only thing I could tell you is.
It feels great.
Yes.
That's very inspired.
Yes.
That's very inspiring and very well versed people in that adventure.
area. I would say my statement might some people might have liked it but who runs
archlinics probably don't have a kid's out. They have just way too much tax.
What do you think about it?
That's fine. What do you mean when you do have kids?
Dad come play it, hang on. Okay it's compiling. I got it.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Two days. Let's undo that. Well maybe you are right. Maybe my statement was not correct.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Daddy's up there.
I sent those to you.
I sent them.
Careful.
We have some work stuff around here.
We have three set of five set of three.
Four.
Four you were?
You don't have to say it. We have a party.
Thank you.
Let's keep on going.
There is a helicopter sound with the audacity sent to us.
I guess it was more how you do this stuff.
You really didn't know it since Adam couldn't capture sound on the acid?
That was not sent to us.
Yeah, that was...
Oh, this one is mine. Never mind. Never mind.
The energy postures were just fine though.
I think it's because it's plugged into the G-State.
And then how to set up G-State server with an U-R-D...
Herend.
And it was actually the last...
It's previous release.
It's just a standard set up G-State server.
It's an actual server machine.
I think it's a...
It's like a point like turning G-State server on.
I think it's like...
I think it's like...
I think it is...
Yeah, it's just...
Because whatever they have here, that's just a client.
So if I want to go somewhere...
If I want to go and connect to your machine,
I view what up it's called as a server.
Where is it actually?
System, preferences, remote, desktop.
There's a low remote desktop preferences.
It says a lot.
Yeah, because I see yours whenever I look at it.
Or when I was a network, Adam's remote desktop.
You know, he's the man.
He actually...
Where do I work?
Which I don't know where I work.
He has a node on a network.
And it has his name left.
He's the man.
Do you want to drive him to it?
And Sheldon says that I didn't have an answer.
So she never advertised your name on the network.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was supposed to go in parallel.
He was supposed to go in parallel.
If he goes in, I don't know.
It's on the whole network.
Oh, right.
Well, that's about it for a newsletter.
Excuse me?
It's probably extended for...
It was there.
What it is, it's the Soma group.
It's my virtual machine.
It's on.
So I keep getting the work back.
It's extended to the work network too.
Yeah.
And of course, Soma never cleans it out.
No.
Why would?
No.
Yeah, why would it?
It might come back.
We'll just leave it there.
Just in case.
Absolutely.
So until you reboot.
What's Taylor?
I, once in a while, felt that I had to work from my virtual machine.
It's on my virtual machine.
It's on the masterhouse or the office.
It's on my whole Soma network.
It's on the masterhouse.
It's on the masterhouse.
It's on the masterhouse.
Where is everybody else called their...
You know, number 10s.
It's on the group.
But it's the default.
And you have to see where mine actually has set up as a network that I gave you.
Show them off your products.
I can change the name of my share.
So what I'm going to do with that...
With the network here.
We'll have it next week.
Okay.
I think we will have it next week.
So we're going to bring, like, 100 feet of catapult.
Don't press the mouse there.
Are you over 3 or 100 feet away?
We use the paper right now to scan.
And then maybe we can run it all the way to the back.
We'll probably run it all the way to the back.
We'll probably run it all the way.

Oh.
