This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3854 for Thursday the 11th of May 2023.
Today's show is entitled, 2022-2023 New Years Show Episode 7.
It is part of the series HP Our New Year Show.
It is hosted by HP Our Volunteers and is about 120 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is 2022-2023 New Years Show where people come together and chat.
Can I tell a drunken analogy?
What were you going to tell a drunken analogy?
I wouldn't say anything to a drunken analogy myself.
Yes, but I could.
And yes, you could stop me if you wish.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
As unanimous, if any single person stops me, I'll be stopped.
So I've been breeding cherry shrimp.
They're red shrimp, but not like shrimp, high quality, red.
And I've had them for about a year now and they're super dope.
And you have to call them.
You have to take out some that you don't like and give them to the pet store so other
people can buy them and stuff and house them.
And it's really cool.
But the tree gets too thin and you have to buy somebody else's cherry shrimp every once
in a while.
And that's what just happened here when Talia showed up.
She is the new cherry shrimp because our branches get too thin sometimes.
Speak for yourself.
My branches are just fine.
Thank you.
I think my dad has enough muscles to make up for that.
You know, have y'all ever checked out the Habsburg family tree?
Aren't they the blue?
No, they're the ones with the chin, right?
I haven't looked at the tree, but I've seen the results in that scene.
It's like, it's Jay Leno and Paul.
Jay Leno and Doug Demuro.
I thought Doug was Jay Leno's son.
Well, the Habsburgs all died out.
So that couldn't be Jay Leno.
No.
They all died out.
No, no, no, no.
They spread out first.
They did not die out.
They did not die out.
They are still around in Austria because I know this because my girlfriend works with
someone who's married to a Habsburg.
Oh, I know.
I know.
They are.
They are like, well, no more than 50 percent.
Yeah.
They're fine.
Their chin is a barely noticeable now and they've got most of their limbs.
And I bet they're delicious to nibble on.
Well, people talking about a breeding in like West Virginia and shit, but West Virginia
ain't got shit on European nobility.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that's the fact that you have a blue skin.
Yeah, you don't even need to go into, you don't even need to go into British nobility
to get in breeding.
You just need to go to Cambridge with the highest rates in any Europe.
Why mate?
I don't like that language.
We're not peasants anymore.
You can't call us that with surfs.
Well, surfs, be troved, siblings, quiet, what you like, it's an age, love.
Well, we know that the British like to think of ancestry.com as a dating site.
Oh, joking aside, I think it's Denmark has such a small genetic pool that they actually
have an app, a dating app that tries to ensure that they don't end up sleeping with one
of their family members.
All joking aside, that is really Eastern Kentucky has that.
I'm from California, we have better surfs.
Well, let's just hope that Denmark got to it soon enough before Kentucky did.
I could be wrong about which Scandinavian country it is, but one of them has this app.
And I just found that very funny.
I planned it.
I planned it.
I planned it.
I planned it.
It's the name for the big bubble of all of the Scandinavians, they're a proud and
respectable people.
Yeah, I love Christmas.
I'm half-western Gignan.
I'm at least a quarter to three-eightth Scandinavian, so, you know, by the way, miss, I'll
give you a full credit for...
She gave me that setback.
Breaking up the conversation.
Okay.
The reason I was ducking in and out and muting myself is it was feeling entirely too much
like home.
That is not a compliment.
Well, no, he was trying to talk to you again, but, you know, you're not on here right
now.
I could always install a month on your phone and join the conversation with me.
I got a compliment for you, Joe.
Your daughter is phenomenal.
How much were you sweating?
Did you pull your collar at all when she was like, he's not that way?
No.
I don't even know if I was in the room when she said that.
Wow.
You definitely need to listen back to the recording.
She is, she is, she is very sharp.
Yeah.
I know that.
Uh, yeah.
She said you were running Windows, Joe.
Oh, well, I do have one machine that tool boots, and so it's true that I have a Windows
machine.
And my work machine runs Windows.
Yeah.
What she didn't tell you is that she runs Linux on her laptop.
No, but just a heads up because, because, you know, this morning, we, you know, it's
all up here.
I told her you spelled it without a Z.
I told her you said that in the only part that hurt her feelings.
She's, no, my dad would not say sorry about that.
He doesn't say sorry.
Are you saying I don't say sorry?
Actually, actually, yeah, he is as beautiful and sharp as any, any classic Japanese sword.
That's a deep compliment that takes, you know, processing and by the way, uh, the sword
that they always carry is the short one.
Yeah, I've done made a nice looking collision, a golf, 50 go, collision, a golf.
There actually is a project to make a 50-cal collision a golf.
Oh, yeah.
But that dude's a shit bag and so I don't care about that.
Uh, you know, it's one of those things.
I don't care how cool the thing you're doing is if you're enough of an asshole, you can
get fucked.
I'm pretty sure there is a project to make a Nike into a 50-cal, but I mean, you know,
that's just normal redneck.
I saw a video, two videos, and I think it was a third and I, they were like 40 minutes
each and sat, much mystified, where a guy somewhere in the North Pacific Islands cut
a part multiple single cylinder engines, four stroke engines and welded them together
into a V4 and that mofo was hardcore.
Like that, just hours and hours and hours of dig welding globs of metal where he needed
metal and then machining it back to the shape he needed.
Just unfrigun believable, like bare feet, no shirt, you know, dust in the lens, the camera
lens.
Could have just run a four-roader wankle and been, you know, twin-turboed, except for
more than the cost of a six-packed can return.
Actually, some years ago, I had a book on Barrett Rifles and with your 50-cal and one of
the shooters was, was a 16-year-old young lady.
It was very nice meeting you, Spora.
Have a nice night.
Have a nice night.
I'll come in and tell you.
Never.
Never.
Stop with the teddy bear talk.
I don't need teddy bear books from the teddy bears.
I did this all the time and tell you.
I'll come in with your teddy bear and open it.
I'll give you a kiss in the forehead.
No!
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?
Glenn.
Glenn.
Glenn.
Glenn, make him stop.
Well, I'm gone.
Well, be in the minute, honey.
Here's your teddy bear.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.

Those people that need to wear glasses like
我們全力的陶咯
我是全力的陶咯
我是全力的陶咯
我是全力的陶咯
我是全力的陶咯
It's time for me to go to bed now.
I'm like, I've been a little bit
and I'll give you a teddy bear, tech you in him,
kissing the forehead.
Oh, I love that.
I've got to find you so I can subscribe.
It's all about a part of tech and coffee.
You know, that's all.
What happens in the gulog stays in the gulog?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Type it in the chat for me, please.
Well, tech and coffee dot info.
Tech and coffee dot info.
Tech and coffee dot info.
Oh, there's always a tech and coffee
telegram channel or the tech and coffee discord channel,
or we've got a lot of tech and coffee people
unmested on now.
Moss, we run it.
It's not like a hippie can be in there.
That's what we're like.
Moss, how could you expect me to type that fast
when I already asked you to repeat it once?
That's that's what I'm trying to repeat.
I thought it was George.
You were trying to get to repeat.
Oh, give me a second.
Yeah, but as soon as I started typing it,
you started telling me, and it's the same thing with this
and the same thing over here and the same thing over there.
Tech and coffee.
I lost my locomotive of.
Are you in Maddenon?
I am.
Yeah, but I couldn't even tell you the name.
Mashed it on.
It's so cumbersome for me.
And I just I can't master it.
So I don't use it more often than I need to to keep it
from being canceled on me.
Well, I've got two Mashed on channels.
But you can put it in the chat.
Oh, you just did, thank you.
Sorry, I'm a what I, but it's not intentional.
That's well, we'll smack you around.
That's what we do.
Wait, what?
Hey, that, no, that's my love language.
Thank you.
Hey, the smackarounds are free in our community.
Think of it as a hippie community.
Back in the day, somebody wrote an article about us.
This is when we were in Google+.
We were like a cult.
So we felt like we needed a deity.
So if you talk to Rose, our botanar, and you say
Marty Moose, she'll say, I'll praise Marty Moose.
Because we decided to make Marty Moose our deity.
Marty Moose is cool.
Clark.
I'll praise Marty Moose.
Anyways, but no, no, no, Clark was not the coolest dude
that hang out with long term, you know, in small bites.
It'd be, you know, the funnest guy in the world.
Maybe, maybe.
Give, wait, you guys are talking about names.
Does anybody know what my name means?
Do you have a podcast?
I used to, well, we weren't, we had a bunch of podcasts
at one point.
I haven't podcasted in a while since I retired.
Before that, actually, we had tech news week.
We had, Glenn, what was that, the freaking Android one?
Android weekly, was it?
Android journal.
Android journal, my god.
I don't even know the fucking podcast.
I'm swearing in somebody else's podcast.
Oh, no, Marty Moose.
All hail Marty Moose.
Basically, I don't know, I've been in half a dozen
before pandemic with A.J.'s, jazz.
We did tuxen coffee for a while to match with tech and coffee.
We did about three or four of those episodes
and the pandemic kind of hit and killed this off.
And he's a doctor.
So, you know, no, like I guess, fine time.
Imagine doing a podcast with him.
That's a good idea.
Imagine trying to find time for a podcast during, you know,
a pandemic that just happened.
Not only that, but my job was making me do like 12 hour days
because they laid off everyone that wasn't like vaccinated.
So, they were like, don't.
You're vaccinated.
I'm like, but we're all working from home.
Who cares, you guys?
George, I got to be the eternal optimist here.
Listen, another PhD co-host who was interested in what you
were interested in in this clever and funny
and knows how to use a microphone.
When God closes the door on one PhD co-host who's clever
and uses a microphone, he opens the door on another.
So, patience, my friend, patience.
Now, you know what, I don't even care anymore.
I retired myself last year, and I mean,
I made enough money throughout my life
so I don't have to do much.
I did sit here for the rest of you guys right now.
It's the only thing I'm doing right now.
Oh, but for the rest of us,
that would have been a really cool conversation
to sit in on, you know, for a year or two.
Exactly.
I mean, at one point, we were the unofficial help desk
of Google Plus.
Oh, yeah, that was Google Plus.
That was actually true.
Somebody wrote an article about that too.
Yeah, there was a, because all these different things were said.
We were one of the biggest tech communities in Google Plus
and the little community thing.
Even though I think about, I'm gonna say, Glen,
if I have to go out on a limb between dead accounts
and bots, Soviet fem bots, we probably had,
I mean, remove about 80,000 of those accounts
were like garbage.
Oh, probably.
That's being moderate, yeah.
So you were the unofficial spam receptacles.
Well, no, actually, this is where Kirin comes in.
No, listen, don't say no.
That's exactly what he was saying.
That's what he was saying.
Yes, we were.
We were, okay.
But Kirin Sporif in here, he's now, what is he, 28, 29 now?
I've known him since he was 17 years old,
which sounds really scary when you think about it that.
But he would come in.
I'm in.
I'm in.
He would have known.
I don't questionable people at least twice that long.
Well, he was, he was a kid.
He came in and he would tell us,
because we had, most of the admins were in the States,
one or two in the UK and stuff and went in France.
And he would tell us like, oh, this guy's like,
doing bad things like this hour or something.
I'm like, okay, I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.
You're a fucking admin now.
Just kill them, okay?
And honestly, he was probably one of our most active admins.
Oh yeah, no, he probably murdered more of the people
than I, I don't even want to know if they body county ass.
Okay, here's, here's a weird thing, okay?
Like, sort of the point of your story, what you just said,
you know, like, if somebody's interested in a job,
go ahead and give them that job.
Isn't it weird how hard it is and how unique
and individual that lesson is to learn on your own?
And then when you're in a room full of people
who know that, it's so obvious, it's like a, a, a,
a face bomb.
Well, he's, he's freaking smart.
I mean, you saw that.
He's a freaking doogie house or for crepes.
But, you know, he would come in.
He was a kid hanging out with a bunch of adults
and we had video chats and hangouts at the time.
We had like three hangouts going simultaneously.
That's how, that's 30 people, like,
because the hangouts only held 10 at one point.
So, but he would come in and when we,
when we started the community, when they came out with,
so do you remember when Google plus started communities,
the day it started, more or less?
No, what, I need a quick reminder,
what was Google plus?
So, Google, Google plus was a,
the way that they had the thing that was,
that was called a wave and everyone went,
wave was before all that.
And everyone was like, oh, just like fire.
Okay, so Google plus was like Twitter and Facebook
had a child and it made it better.
Oh, yes, that was actually good.
Yeah.
So, they incorporated hangouts and that's how we all met.
I created a hangout called tech and coffee one day for video
because I worked from home.
I've been working from home for years.
I work from home, like, you get really bored
when you work from home.
You do, you know what you've created a video,
hangout and a bunch of people joined
and we created a community after that.
You know what's the most incredible part about that story?
What?
My best buddy in the whole world,
except for one other guy, they're like even,
but in completely different ways.
Like my best, best, best, best buddy in the whole world.
I trust with anything in the whole world
was on Google plus and gaming invite.
And I was like, yeah, no, thank you.
You could have been part of a good tech and coffee,
but I mean, it was my favorite thing.
I don't, I don't think he knew about tech and coffee.
His, his motives were all teria to your own.
Yeah, no, I mean, but I mean, we had a lot of people
joining. Wait, are you talking, hey, George,
who was that guy that was always talking about monetizing?
Oh, that was Karl Breyrton, he ran the hangout show.
And he always hit me up on the side.
He's like, because we were like,
maybe a tad more popular.
He would run people like 24, seven into hangouts,
try to monetize it, try to sell shirts, all that stuff.
And like people in our community tried to do that too,
because I'm more, I was brought up near Woodstock, New York.
So I'm like, I fucking hippie and I marry to hippie.
So he'd have been to Woodstock, New Hampshire.
No, I've never heard of this is, never heard of it.
This is where I used to live in a time frame there.
That's the fucking hippie town still there.
It's a fucking hippie.
Is not, is not where, where I used to,
close to where I used to live a hippie town.
Is that not a hippie town?
Woodstock, yeah, it's a hippie town too.
It's a hippie town.
It's a total different kind.
So, you know, but I don't know.
I mean, we ran it like a hippie thing
and he was like, let's monetize this.
And he's like, we should get together.
And the other reason he wanted that is because
anytime I started, he would run it 24-7.
I would come in, started up or somebody else would,
and then people would flock to it.
And he got really pissed off at that.
And I was just like, no, he's like, let's,
let's try to sell shirts or do things or whatever.
I'm like, look, man, I'm that after monetizing this crap,
you know, and I put in my money for a lot of things.
Like, I'd send people shirts and stickers and shit like that
because I love sending shirts and stickers.
Why should I make people pay for this garbage?
I just found a box of shirts and stickers yesterday.
Last night, I, and not only that,
but the HPR table banner, holy shit.
I can't believe you brought that up
when I was trying to interrupt you
with some other dumb joke.
That's right.
I just, I don't want stickers.
I got about three, that's right.
I'd love a set.
Yeah.
I can say you some stickers, yeah.
Can I get some returns?
Yeah, we've got stickers.
We got plenty.
Oh, wait.
I'll tell you know, I have tons of HPR stickers
because I get them.
But the HPR stickers I got,
where you don't have is an odd camp in, in the UK.
Which, you don't have?
I will take, I love H, you don't have the HPR
and HPR sticker on my laptop.
People move away from me.
Yes.
Okay, you have the Clat 2 stickers.
Yeah, well, I, when it says hacker on it,
anything it says hacker.
And people, I just think you're just trying
to break into the federal government or something.
Well, I mean, I'm using Linux.
It's definitely a hacker software,
as some of you once said in the movie.
Yeah, when they, when they see what they saw on,
what was that TV show, Mr. Robot?
Oh, Mr. Robot.
They see the Cali, Cali Linux thing on my wallpaper.
They're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The HPR stickers, Mr. Robot is the most accurate
of movies or TV shows,
only the first season.
Yeah, the first season is extremely accurate
when it comes to a lot of the technology that they show.
The first season is a story written around real life.
It should have said based on real events.
And the story surrounding it was completely different
and it was all different people.
But all the hacks, all the events,
those were all like Kevin, Mittnik, hacks.
And I think I saw, maybe I'm just a fan boy,
maybe I imagined it.
I thought I saw a whitey cracker hack in there.
It, there was, it was all real things.
Yeah, well, it's funny because people see that wallpaper,
but then there's the start menu on the bottom
because like when I'm at work and if people have an iPhone
that has too much data on it
and they can't transfer all the data like,
you have to have a story.
I just, I plug it into iTunes, download it
and then upload it to their new phone.
But yeah, it's just hilarious because people were always like,
oh, there's Cali Linux, oh God, no, he's a hacker.
I'm like, no, no, I'm not.
Well, yeah, I am.
But no, I'm not.
Hold on, hold on.
Cali Linux, that's just the wallpaper.
As far as the start menu is concerned,
you really need it since CrunchBang shut down.
Oh my God, I miss CrunchBang so much.
Like the old CrunchBang, not the...
I have a good story about it.
Whatever the new one.
Listen, my wife doesn't even know what Linux is
and she misses CrunchBang.
She would see everybody and go, I don't like that one.
Phillips in our community, Phillips in second coffee.
Yeah, I know.
I talked with them a couple of times.
I told them, I wish CrunchBang was...
I wish it wasn't whatever labs it is now.
I was like, dude, I love CrunchBang so much.
Okay, I love CrunchBang so much.
Hold on.
CrunchBang is pretty good.
Hold on, old man Pokey is gonna sit you voice down.
He used to come on the New Year's Eve show
and talk with us.
Oh, cool.
Probably.
He's pretty cool.
And so did his wife.
Oh, Becky.
Becky and me, oh my gosh.
This picture, Becky, I don't know what it is.
We hang out, I don't know, I mean, it's weird.
Every time I'm over there, we all did just, it's really good.
I believe they came on the second and third and maybe fifth,
maybe fourth.
I don't remember.
The HPR New Year's Eve show.
They were there.
They were part of it helping it to work.
They were so dope.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, they are great people.
They're probably some of the best people I know.
Yeah, they're the first people I've ended up here.
Yeah, they're the first people I've ended up here.
Period.
Wait, is this a live show?
Because I'm in...
This is live.
This is live.
It's only...
I'm walking up.
This is in Farnham in the UK.
I'm walking up to the, where the event is and I'm about two hours early.
I usually work the event, not like a prostitute.
Anyway, so I'm waiting up and I have, my linux, what was it?
My linux elitist, whatever, shirt on.
And his daughter runs up and she goes, he's got a linux shirt on or he's got a penguin
shirt on.
Please tell us.
Wait, wait, wait.
He's wearing a crunch bang shirt.
I should've didn't tell her about the t-
Oh, you like crunch bang?
And he goes, I am crunch bang.
Oh, that's awesome.
Oh, shit.
Pokey, while you're pulling the old age card, how old are you?
How old am I?
I'm 59 now.
That's not old in this group.
No, you know what?
I mean, I don't feel like I'm old.
Okay, then...
No, no, no, no.
He honestly does.
He's old in this group.
He's old in this group.
It's just the whole thing is Moss is your ancient in this group.
Well, I don't know if George is old with me.
Well, Moss, then having heard the rest of the room's answer to the question chronologically,
I am probably the youngest person in the room.
But HBR is...
I'll leave.
I was there for the first New Year's Eve show.
I'll just say that.
I'll leave.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
I got it.
Forty middleish.
I got it.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
I got it.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
Forty middleish.
God, I missed 41.
That was a good idea.
Yeah.
That was almost 30 years ago.
I got you, Arnold, I didn't know that.
I just turned 70 in early December.
I didn't think you would be 70.
I didn't think I would be either, but it happend.
Most many years ago, if I had told myself I would live to the age of 40, I would have
laughed my ass off and front of me and been like, you're nuts.
I picked you as my 40th birthday, it was me and my wife and a few people and I look at this
because it was hanging on my wall in my bedroom and I'm like, God, that was so long ago.
Y'all want to hear about my new project?
Now that I finished the last one.
I was only afraid to say my age in case I counted wrong and told you a lie.
Yes, what's your new project, Byron?
So I got an order of PC cartboards in from PCBWay the other day and today I got in all the
shit from Malzer and yeah, I'm about to solder together the first part of the analog computer I
designed. Well, that beats the hell out of my project. All I did was screw a fan to a ceiling,
so my wife could pedal her exercise by.
PCBWay that sounds like a yogurt joint, PCBWay, you stay in, it's a custom PCB board place.
They became way more than PCBs, they do CNC, they do a whole bunch of stuff now, they're
it's ridiculous what they offer and it good prices too, but they're paid advertisement.
Their stock fell off the map and they became PCBWay treats, so they are unfamiliar to some of us.
Yes, probably, yeah. Well, that's because they had his sprinkles.
Anyway, yeah, I'm building an analog computer to my own design.
Yeah, the fact that they didn't have the rainbow sprinkles really ticked me off and I just had to
walk away. I was in a crisis scenario one time involving rainbow sprinkles. I don't know how to
react to that. Then either did I and I still kind of don't, I'm still struggling with it. I mean,
I'm working on it. It's not a struggle. It's, you know, when did you post it?
I did assist problem. Oh, your therapist just came in. Oh, here we go.
Well, how long have you hated your mother?
Just why I never hated my mother, but about 20 odd years now.
Why do you ask? But I could hate a couple of other mothers that I hate.
That's not my mother. No, it was when I, when I moved to Ohio for college,
just out of fresh out of high school. My girlfriend came with me out in Ohio.
We went into ice cream shop and she wanted jimmies and they're like, look,
they're like, what the hell is jimmies? And she looked at me and I said sprinkles and they
looked at me and said, wait, what the hell? They didn't know what jimmies were and we didn't know
what sprinkles were and it was a crazy thing. And then they were rainbow sprinkles and we both left
very confused. Yeah, I'm sorry that you went to Ohio because that's just the worst place on earth.
It's never understood the point of that story.
Proteus, I've missed every Ohio Linux fast for the sole reason is that I swore off Ohio.
I never go there and I drive around it if I had to get to the other side.
I live in Kentucky and the only reason I go through Ohio is because I go up to upstate New York
every so often and I do about 110 through Ohio just because I don't want to be there.
How far up by 75 are you? I'm not far away from Lexington.
Well, I'm outside of Knoxville.
He's like, I'm done with these people.
Is that like a mistake?
No, I want to feel like I can't deal with this and move down with his life.
Well, it would be great if his speaker or if his wires were long enough from the you know,
work the bench and be able to talk to you guys at the same time.
And when you tell him to get up the bench, that means what?
Means he has a work bench so big he doesn't know how to sew the wires together.
Hey, he definitely does wait.
Oh, that. Okay.
Yeah, he's a pounder.
He's not doing them now with the intention of avoiding us.
No, he's doing them now because he does them now.
And then he'll be back when he's when he's done with his number of lifts.
Yeah, he does this all day.
Yeah, he does it during mint casts sometimes.
Sounds questionably healthy.
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing in here.
He works great for a stress relief apparently.
How much stress relief do you need?
Is anything with you stressful?
Yes, living with me can be stressful, but I was good to work too.
So I keep testing a theory in Macedon.
I post a picture of my cat saying happy, you know, meow year.
I'm pouring out my cat is.
I've actually written a couple of cat filks.
Cat, what?
I am a filter.
And you can look that up in Wikipedia.
There is rather an extensive page on what filk is.
Probably better than you're describing it to me here.
I don't know.
The word just beat somewhere else in my head.
Well, the general concept is
is it's the music of the
science fiction and fantasy literary community.
Oh, you guys should seriously consider rebranding.
That is a really bad way.
Well, originally it was fulc and someone typoed.
Yeah, but it's unintentionally like magnetically negative.
You really should consider rebranding.
I we've been using it too long to rebrand now.
No such thing.
No sense to forties.
No, well, someone came in and stole your name and made it mean something
that you don't want to be associated with.
I would I would still consider it.
So is that like ponding?
You know, is that the whole thing?
You can you can be the artist formerly known as pilk.
And do not the pilk.
Yeah.
Yeah, like it's a silent f.
Thank you.
I would like it's nice landic artists, by the way.
Oh, okay.
Well, doesn't make Prince irrelevant.
Thank you very much.
Exactly.
I thought Prince was always irrelevant.
A black man in Minnesota.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Did not know this got into a racist off-quake.
I'm sorry.
It was not an enemy racist.
I just got to just like I'm going to go hang out with my cat now.
Yeah.
And yeah, looks like hey cat, come here.
I need to I need to pet on you and not feel racist.
Wait, what?
Okay, my cat's probably racist anyway.
She hates all of human kinds.
Well, I mean, if it's not your foot, she hates it.
Yeah.
100 points to Proteus for B in the first one to say it.
Thank you, Proteus.
In fact, thank you.
Welcome.
Thank you so much.
200 points for Proteus for B in the first one to say it.
Woo-hoo!
Wait, what's the what's the highest point range we're at so far?
Have you ever watched whose line isn't anyway?
Yes, the points don't matter.
Yep.
All I can say is all I can say is all the cats are black.
So wait a minute.
I'll just wait with that.
The points absolutely matter.
There's just no range.
Oh.
Well, then what do you do your episodes before the end?
You're screwed.
Gotcha.
What do you think of your own zone if you have no way?
I'm just trying to figure out how I turn color and got here.
I'm just saying.
Oh, this isn't Tala.
This is Jackie.
Jackie?
Oh.
I knew that wasn't Tala.
It was going to ask.
Your voice is not.
Well, it was a female at Joe's residence.
We aren't sure who it is because we can't see you.
That's okay.
Well, Tala is my mini me.
Well, yeah, your voice was not as surprising as Tala's.
We're expecting a lot out of you.
She blew us out of the water.
That's okay.
It is perfectly fine that way.
She's been doing that.
I mean, the best one was when she had the new assistant
vice principal at the school,
convinced that she was in second grade
and had this lady going all year.
And she was like, I love your daughter.
She's so articulate and so sweet.
And I can't believe she's in second grade.
And I'm like, I don't have a second grader.
And then in the principal,
I mean, just looking over like she got you
because the time she was in fifth grade.
Well, the, okay.
Yes, it's very impressive for fifth grader
to pretend to be a second grader.
But she just came into a rumpel
us and pretended to be a PhD.
And we were sold.
Did you just like, you just trying to sell them
your imaginary PhD imaginary?
I didn't.
She's like, what's imaginary about it?
They fell for it. I am.
She wrote me a prescription.
It's not a magic to us.
We believe she wrote me a prescription.
Was that wrong?
She told me if you can.
It is the United States.
And this is the government.
So there it this could be a, it could be legal.
We have nothing to do with the government.
But she pulled a catch me if you can.
So you got to watch for her.
Her sense of humor is really dry.
I'm not watching for her.
I like the prescription she gave me.
It's what I think will fix it.
You know, apparently if you have a dry sense of humor,
that's an early sign of Alzheimer's.
So well, it's New Year's Eve.
There aren't too many people around here.
There's a very dry.
I pray to God the rest of Alzheimer's is as fun as the dry sense of humor.
I asked for the sarcastic sense.
Actually, actually, I didn't say sarcasm was better than dry.
I just said, I hope Alzheimer's is as fun as dry.
No, you got to get her going when she's being in her sarcastic
and she's pissed off at you.
Then she's hilarious.
No, I have enough of that in my life.
I don't need, I'm sorry.
You don't need another sassy teenager?
I don't need another sassy teenager.
Are you trying to get rid of one?
I have a sassy six year old.
I don't need a sassy teenager.
Thank you.
I've got two sassy girl teenagers.
And then I've got a 12 year old who thinks he's 16.
And he tries to talk under his breath like I can't hear him.
Oh, you mother.
Try to excuse me, excuse me.
That's six year old is a teenager.
Yeah, you're not kidding.
In a really depressing sense,
unless you meant something else.
No, she is quite the angel,
but she does have her moments where I'm like,
wow, where did that come from?
Oh, I thought you meant something else.
Did you do the whole snap in the yes with it too?
Oh, no, she doesn't do the snap.
She knows better than the snap, but like she,
she knows sarcasm better than I did at like 20.
So she's got it down pretty good.
She reminds me of a friend of mine who was semi-offent
for when very her mother was very sick
and her grandmother had to take care of her.
That girl at five was about 22.
Yeah.
She was something really do go on.
I think all of the same time was like that.
She was a managing buddy from,
you know, Nihai to a grasshopper.
A short grasshopper.
I think any time kids did deal with medical.
It's like they grow up and they're like years ahead
or they're peers.
There's days I swear that got my middle one
is actually the oldest.
Actually, the the young lady that I spoke with a while ago,
I described it like a like the short katanas.
Beautiful short and razor sharp.
Yeah, that was Tala.
Yep, that was my little one.
That's my that's my Tala.
That's my middle one.
Tala the shorter.
Is her full title if you want to do it with.
Just Tala the short.
The shorter, but that makes it longer.
Well, it's the whole thing about short girls.
We're closer to hell.
We, we, we, we, we got the emperor to match too.
You know, Tala's barely five foot.
No, no.
Proteus called out Moss when he shouldn't have gone there.
And I'm calling you out.
You shouldn't go there.
Oh, no, I was calling out.
She was like, we're shorter to hell.
I was like, oh, okay.
Actually, close to hell.
But yeah, it reminds me of somebody from a bulletin board
that I know who was during during the day.
She was a medical facility administrator.
On weekends, she, she was a role player.
When she wasn't an NRA pistol instructor.
Well, you definitely, Tala would definitely like to talk to you about that.
But she was an archer.
I like starch here.
That was fun.
Actually, actually, this lady,
well, let's say it was a 50 shades type bulletin board.
And this lady followed what orders.
He felt like following.
And if she didn't feel like following orders,
well, she could park your hair at about the top of her nose.
So we're just saying, don't make it, Scotch.
The perfect person to bring home with me.
Don, don, don, don.
Short girl that, but she didn't like your order to park your hair
with her pistol.
She fit right in here.
We'll give her a high room.
Because this, because this was online and she was already
committed, I'd never actually saw this person.
But she, she rewrote the definition of submission in my mind.
Like, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, there are in bars that are,
she could be, be soft as silk.
But that was only when she chose to be sort of like,
you know, a relaxed and a condo.
I don't want to break in.
Oh, we missed, uh, Newfoundland Labrador.
No, no, we had three minutes.
No, I think we did that.
Oh, wait, no, we didn't do.
He's right.
We missed mother.
You can't leave your mother out of it.
I was going to say mother Fudger.
Wait, son of a peep, son of a, hey, just like for a quick visual,
I think it's about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of us active
in the room right now.
Just flash your mic if you're a podcaster of any stretch of the imagine.
Flash your mic.
Wait, does this, how about podcaster?
Because I haven't done one in a while.
Yeah, I was going to say it's been, what, four years since we've done one.
At least three or four years, three years since I've done one.
So five out of seven of us, then.
Yeah, flash your mic, um, loss, just, you know,
pressure pushed to talk button so I could see your icon light up.
What's that?
Are you a podcaster?
Am I a podcaster?
Yeah, just of any stretch of the imagination, yeah.
I am a host on three separate podcasts.
Okay, so that's six out of seven of us.
I don't know, we've been talking for years about getting Android journal
and uh, tech news week back together.
I'd say we probably do that sometime.
Actually, we're going to do Tux and coffee.
We're going to read, read, read that one.
Because that, that one we've already got the domain for.
We've got the website setup for, um, all I need to do is, if I,
when I can't get jazz to go in, I need to get somebody else.
And I should have done that, but I was super busy during the pandemic.
So out of, out of the six of us, out of the seven of us,
that podcast, who's done HBR episodes.
Um, I've been interviewed on a couple, I guess.
It may be five or six, does that count?
I've been on there, look, what is it?
The weekly show, the monthly show where there's
talking about all the different shows?
They mentioned your show.
No, I've been on there with them.
Oh, oh, okay, gotcha.
Monthly show.
I was interviewed during dog camp two times.
One at Lantern.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
I'm walking around my neighborhood during fireworks.
And I have PTSD.
Should I be doing this?
Probably not.
Well, of course, sitting in my home in my house.
Oh, I also have.
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Ah, I don't know what that was.
That was fun.
It's more than see.
I think it was more than see.
No, I am, I'm literally a veteran.
And I worked with Patriot missiles.
And I had scuds exploding over me.
My wife has seen her jump.
Yeah, I get the fireworks.
Oh, so the cathartic, the, the, the fireworks all around me right now.
Yeah, it's cathartic.
If you do it, watch the ones as they're shooting up in the air.
And aim at them and try to time your trigger pull at the explosion.
It's very cathartic.
Does you pretend it's, it's like reverse missile attack.
Well, I don't, I don't, I don't know why I have it.
Literally what I, it's literally basically what I used to do.
It's, you know, shooting a missile at another missile.
Only, wow.
Only therapy on the actual reality.
That's what I said therapy, not reality.
Well, Joe and I are on mint cast and Joe also has the Linux link tech show.
And, uh, Linux lug cast along with more than see who's on, um,
well, Linux lug cast and sometimes on Linux link tech show.
Mortancy I believe has done an HBR episode.
I believe I probably done a few three.
I think I believe I at least three.
I believe that's where I met in no more than see from pay.
I think I get an answer from the HPR because our,
the first episode of distro operas digest was also broadcast as an HPR episode.
Okay. All right. So will you please do episode of HPR?
You guys know how to do a podcast and how to do episode.
It's anything.
It's interesting to you.
Anything at all.
All right.
So I'm ready to start flaying work and I'll do it.
I, I didn't hear either of you.
George, you're quieter.
Um, I'm walking around and there is fireworks all around me.
Okay.
And what's the flame war about?
Fireworks?
Okay.
So,
Vi,
Vim,
E-Max,
or Nano, go.
Nano.
Who cares?
Do what you like.
That's what you'll know.
Who cares is the true.
Who cares?
No.
No.
Vi.
No.
Go to gooey world.
Do cater or something.
You can't always use a gooey.
I usually just need to do that actually.
Okay.
Okay.
Still go.
Vim,
Vi,
Nano,
mouse,
or K wars.
Same answer.
Vim.
I had to go between all of those Vim.
Vim would be the only one worthwhile.
I do actually,
I do actually love G-Edit.
You've got me there as much as I keep the slide.
Oh, yeah.
That's the perfect one.
That's a good one.
Okay.
It's the only one I can use.
Really that and,
and,
and uh,
Windows,
notepad or whatever,
when I'm on my own.
One note is absolutely awesome.
Yeah.
Oh,
I didn't say one out.
Don't put words in my mouth.
I wasn't allowed to put words into,
um,
that's as useless as Windows itself.
Thank you.
What, one note?
One note.
No.
One note.
One note.
I'm pretty to fool.
Boy, Mordancy is sure excellent here.
One note.
One note.
One note.
One note.
One note.
One note.
Hold on.
Mordancy.
You can't.
That's absolutely what's going on.
There's dogs barking all around.
Mordancy.
Try
keying up when no one else is lit up,
and everyone else try not interrupting him.
See if that works.
Hold it out.
Too low.
You failed,
Moss.
At this point,
also drunk.
It's hard to hold your tongue.
All right.
Moss.
Mordancy.
Go ahead.
All right, hold on.
Okay.
So, so, Moss, it's your turn to talk next.
But all you can talk about is what
Mordancy's about to say.
So hang on.
Once you load one note in Windows,
then you can use the Windows key and ask
as a snapshot tool,
and you don't have anything else.
That's the best feature I think of one note.
I'll have to think about that.
I, I don't even know what that means right now.
So,
when you want to change your language,
it starts with a W,
and I don't know that one.
I'm forced to use it at work tax.
That's all the red hat machines.
It's so easy to take.
It's all straight known as wind blows.
Just, just in case you're not used to it.
Wind blows.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I am.
No, it was wind blows.
I used to take a
Joe, you can't interrupt them, please.
I'm not there.
No, I'm doing his curls.
And then
Joe,
I'm going to drop the weight.
Joe, you might have to switch to push the talk.
Probably can't from where he's at.
I think he's dead at whatever just happened there.
I'm just hearing tabs,
or whatever fell on his nuts.
No, that was a concrete slam.
If he was heard, it would have been a much wetter
thud.
Then you heard the screaming in the crying
and then the tears,
and oh my god, call the ambulance.
You heard my wife laughing and probably my kid, too.
Yeah.
In which case?
All your kids wouldn't be laughing in a couple days.
Doesn't matter.
The people on site are handling it.
It's none of our business.
Let's just try to listen to what wouldn't you say?
I used to take a screenshot and then move it to
a paint and then resize it and then
save it and then import it in for documentation.
And with one note, once you've opened it,
you can use windows and the S key
and a screenshot, whatever you want.
And it saved in the buffer and you can paste it.
Sorry, my bad.
No one heard the emergency because I keyed up on you.
It was my bad.
Can you repeat that please?
How much?
Just the part I talked over.
You mentioned not not no pad,
but the screen photo and whatever the hell it is in Microsoft.
Paint, you mentioned paint,
which is I really hate that that's the only thing
that does what it does because it's such a nightmare.
It's never gotten any better.
But after that, we heard that much.
I mean, you could use paint.net,
but anyway, go ahead.
Paint.net on Linux?
No, no, on windows when I make a documentation for my co-workers.
So I used to do a screen print,
alt screen print to take a picture and then paste it into paint
and then edit it, resize it, crop it, whatever,
and then save it and import it into documentation.
And once you've opened one note once on a Windows machine,
it activates something somewhere.
And Windows key and the S become a snapshot tool.
And you can just drag from corner to corner
whatever you want to take a picture of.
It saves it in the buffer and then you can paste it wherever you want.
You don't have to use multiple tools.
But snippet does the same thing.
I mean, but snippet does the same thing.
It's a terrible program.
We haven't been, but if you're in a lockdown workstation
in a Windows shop, you may not be able to do that.
Oh, okay, I thought snippet came with it.
Fair, fair point.
Yeah, I was about to say there is,
I think snippet has a feature where you can record steps
and it will write out what you're doing
and also give screenshots of like where the mouse is.
But yes, definitely.
That's probably not that's probably not snippet.
There's a replace.
They've already phased it out.
As soon as it got easy to use and functional,
they're replacing it with something else
that's like three steps harder to use.
Three steps more obnoxious to use.
But Proteus, you make me think of a question.
You said Windows, no, paint.net.
Is there an equivalent for Linux?
I cannot do any kind of bitmap editing on Linux.
Everything I've ever tried has not worked for me.
Is there an equivalent?
For bitmap, the only things I use really
that I can go from Windows and to Linux
is just tape, gimp, and I haven't come on.
I met on Linux, but
come on, imp is not png.
For bitmap, it's png.
Yeah, png too, yep.
I'm sorry, I'm just walking around.
I just can't find anything on Linux
that I can edit simple little text and
simple little graphics to make,
make believe road signs to fuck up my friends.
It just, I have to do that on Windows.
And after being a Linux user for the better part
of 14, 15 years,
it hurts me that there's still not a thing
that I can do that with, that I can do that with.
I know all of you can gimp.
I mean, I've done that.
I did that for years in techy coffee.
I was the screenshot team.
Wait a minute. What are you trying to do?
What combination of two or three things?
Did you say you're trying to do with one app?
No, one thing, not two.
Somebody else said two or three things.
I just said one.
He's just trying to make road signs.
Yes, exactly. I'm trying to make road signs to
fuck with friends.
Um, well, I mean, gimp,
but I mean, there's there's other graphic programs.
Gimp is the more popular one.
That's the one that everyone installs.
Yeah, right now I do it on MSP,
and I always have.
Is there something that is MSP simple?
MSP easy for Linux?
Yes, they're never.
Oh, yeah. Wait.
Now there, there is.
We're talking Kura.
Like, there is one though.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
There's, there is a really, really
super basic.
Well, you know what?
Like, um, I don't know if this,
this newest version of Mint 2.1
is freaking crazy because they've
changed almost all the programs.
But, um, previously,
when you did, um, say like,
you opened a photo and something,
uh, you, you could edit it in it.
And I can't even think of the name of that program.
George, one of the viewers.
If you were James Bond,
your nuts have already fried.
You didn't come up with an answer in time.
I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry. You can just shoot me then.
No, we're not shooting.
You were cutting your nuts off of the later.
Oh, wow.
I'm going to kill you.
Yeah.
Uh, no.
CRETA, uh, there was another one.
I think it was PETA.
No, hold on.
Let me find it.
CRETA K, R, so a KDE app, K, R, E, E, T, A.
K, R, I, T, A.
Yeah, K, R, I, T, A.
I've got to an app that go up and it's why I'm asking.
There's also like Pinta, um,
there's actually a link.
I'll, I'll drop it in the chat here.
So Pinta is what the same as CRETA,
but for a different, uh, stop.
I'm on cinnamon if that matters.
Wait, why is it when I go into the chat?
It's like, hey, type of message to user GeoSpart.
I'm like, wait a minute.
I want to send it to everybody, uh,
because you hit G tab probably in an auto completed.
Wow, this installs.
The coolest person in here.
That's why.
Oh, it's magnet-ish.
Sorry, you're right.
Yeah, that's what it was.
Okay.
I just dropped it in the chat, uh,
in case anybody need to know.
It was, uh, uh, open source, uh,
alternatives, kind of link.
I'm going to, I feel like I'm in a word.
I think on just about every machine that I've installed, uh,
Linux on, I put CRETA, um,
it's been a long time since I've used it.
Um, I hate to say it,
but I've kind of like for my laser engraving and 3D printing stuff,
I do a lot of Windows usage.
But for everything else is Linux, uh,
well, that's driver-based.
That's not like,
ooh, Windows so better.
Yeah, no, no.
It honestly is just like the,
the laser I use, um,
I mean, that's browser-based.
Uh, it's a glow forge, um,
but I also have a couple of, um,
uh, oh god, what are they?
The, um, X tool D ones.
I have a couple of those, uh,
and then I also have some CR10s that I do
for printing, 3D printing, um,
in a silhouette for vinyl cutting.
But other than that, uh,
most of the time I'm usually in Linux.
George, yes.
Tell me about the Teddy bears again.
Okay, so when you go to bed tonight,
I'm going to come into your room and talk it into bed.
I'm going to put the covers right up to your chin.
No, I'm going to tuck a teddy bear right next.
I'm not going to bed until you come with me.
And, and then the teddy bear next to you afterwards.
But by the, by the by,
I'm always big spoon.
All of it.
No, I'm big spoon.
No, I'm always big spoon.
Sorry, I'm big spoon.
George is always big spoon and the,
the teddy bear has glowing,
red eyes and has the stare.
George, we're going to have to call this off,
but I'm keeping the teddy bear.
Unless you can learn to live with a big spoon.
It's, it's just a bear.
Sometimes, sometimes I'll let you think you'll be big spoon.
Then it's a lie.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, well, that was my plan too.
This is, this is not a healthy relationship.
We're engaging upon.
It's, trust me, it's best to just call it off
at the first sign of danger.
Like, and that's legit danger.
Two, two big spoons.
One of, one of, play mind games to make it okay
for the other big spoon.
It's not helping.
That's kind of scary.
It's almost like we're just taught that
this is going to be the weirdest podcast ever
when somebody wants to do it.
Like, what are they talking about big spoons?
What does that mean?
I, I, I sincerely,
I think we should just be friends.
Exactly.
Let's call it off.
Well, both be big spoons to the other big one.
Now, with all due respect,
I don't mind being second big spoon.
I promise to make you all enjoy being a little spoon.
That's all I'm going to say on that.
You, you can be first big spoon if you want.
I don't mind being back up big spoon.
That's whatever.
I'm just okay.
I'll hold on.
We have to go by, by overall size.
So I am six one.
Oh, he is large.
Yeah, he could be big.
And, oh, I'm five 11 to say what?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, I must protest.
It has nothing to do with height.
It's, it's, it's, I'm six one and I,
and it has nothing to do with height.
I'm five 11.
Okay, then we're going to have to
245 pounds right now.
Contest then to figure out who's big spoon in front of the
uh, no, no,
Proteus.
We don't do that here.
If you want me to come to you tonight,
the wrong show.
I'm trying to tell you.
We can run another show if you really want to do that one.
But in fact,
it's going to be a whole new thing.
It is my, it is my sincere advice and opinion as a professional.
You shouldn't do that anywhere.
If you want to talk to him at night and it's in my audio chat,
you have to go here.
I will just say it's the peanut butter uh,
whiskey that's talking at that point.
The penis.
Oh wow, wait,
I'm pulling it out unless y'all are praying.
I have peanut butter whiskey.
Okay.
I'm already almost the same.
I don't know about that though.
I'm, I'm used to Scottish whiskey.
Is that like, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know if that should be.
Well, I don't currently have peanut butter,
but I do have a salted caramel and I've got a blackberry.
Oh,
Jackie won't be mentioned.
We also got the, uh, the holiday, uh,
Jack Daniel's blend.
George, since you've never had peanut butter whiskey,
it's the most delicious, uh,
delectable alcohol candy on the earth.
It's not real whiskey.
It just, it, I mean, technically,
maybe I disagree in it.
It is not.
If you're talking about Scotch, it,
no, it's still delectable.
Well, it's loaded with sugar and flavors.
It is not the brand that I have is not loaded with sugar
and it is still 40% alcohol,
not 33 or 30, like most of the others.
My, my diabetes is telling me right now
that I have drank way too much.
Well, yes, your diabetes is always going to
die if you drink too much.
Five grams of sugar per ounce is mostly sugar.
The bird dog is only five grams of sugar per ounce,
whereas, uh, uh,
fireball and other flavored brands
tend to be 11 to 12 grams of sugar per ounce.
Okay, this, uh,
this screw ball is 35% alcohol, 70 proof.
Yeah, it's not a problem.
Yeah, screw ball is 11 grams of sugar
in that, whereas, uh,
the bird dog is only five grams of sugar
and it's a full 40% 80 proof.
But you know what else it is?
What?
Pasty.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's, oh, I see.
I think it is yummy.
Yummy.
Fireball and all the amount of their flavors
because, uh, I could get real whiskey
with bird dog and still get the yummy flavor.
You know what else is delicious,
but left delicious compared to screw ball
is San Bucca.
If I drink San Bucca now,
it tastes way more syrupy than it used to.
How much is a bottle?
I have a red, uh,
peanut butter screw balls that I don't know.
It depends how much was, how much checking?
How much was that bottle of screw ball?
Was it 150 millilitre bottle?
30 bucks.
It's usually about 30 bucks.
Yeah.
Well, bird dogs cheaper than that too.
I'm paying 17 for a 750 millilitre.
I like to, I have to fly to Scotland for this,
but I can go get some like lock finers
and bring that back.
And that's like 30 pounds of bottle.
What is that?
Like 45 dollars?
Well, okay, but the 375 size bottle,
I can buy those and not be afraid of them
because if I go a little crazy and pour it
one of those bottles,
the whole thing on top of bottle of wine,
it's, I still don't get hung up.
It's very kind to you.
Well, when I get whiskey,
I just got my chevis bottle
because I'm not opening the good ones.
The whole thing, I never drink anymore.
Me and the wife used to have a bit of a hobby
when it came to drinking and then we had kids
and we basically stopped.
Oh, I even basically drink like two
or three times a year now.
I used to be competitive semi-pro.
I understand where you're coming from.
Drinking whiskey.
We were hobbyists.
We were extreme hobbyists.
I don't think I've ever called alcoholism extreme hobbyists,
but okay.
Have you ever, have you ever done it
while wearing a wingsuit?
We went to God Club, so yes,
we did it while wearing shoes with wings.
You guys need to be in technical.
Okay, I need to come hang out with you guys
because the closest thing I get to wing suits
is like flying RC gliders and I haven't done that.
I've jumped out of helicopters,
but I refuse to jump out of airplanes.
I've jumped out of airplanes,
but I haven't jumped out of a helicopter.
Joe, you got yes and down, dude.
I know.
That's cool, you know.
I have a severe issue with jumping
out of perfectly good airplanes.
I'm aware of this issue
and I'm quite willing to live with my issue.
Nothing wrong with that issue.
I am totally good to fly to jump out of helicopters
because if that engine stops,
yes, they can auto cycle and come down,
but I'd rather beat them to the ground safely.
Hopefully.
Oh, and just before you jump,
they slow down the engine,
and it's almost like it's standing still and then you fall.
No, they don't claim.
No, they don't slow them down.
They reverse the pitch of the blades.
That's called auto rotation.
It gives it a boost of lift.
Write it before they land it,
or apparently, right before you jump out,
if they don't take the landing.
Apparently, before I have no clue,
all I know is that was the time they were like,
go.
Yeah, that's if they're doing it high enough
for you to pull a parachute,
that's a suicide move for them to do.
They're letting you live their dead.
That hurts.
Or unless it's completely planned.
That's what the rope was for.
Rope what was like a static one.
What is it?
The rope that went around your neck?
You're repelling it from a helicopter.
From the plane.
Helicopter.
Oh, you're a helicopter.
Oh, I'm not a pilot.
You repel.
I've heard how down Cliff's side to mountain sides,
but we heard how we heard how we heard how we heard.
We heard helicopters.
We thought you were talking about parachuting.
Oh, nope.
It doesn't hurt.
You told it was way far up there.
I've repeled, but not out of a helicopter.
Down the cliff.
I've done downclips too.
And down bone.
I've been told about repelling.
No, repellent, repellent.
No, that's repellent. Wait, what?
No, that's the imaginary bottle
the girl scored at me in grade school.
It just watered.
No, it was repellent.
They told me so.
It was anti-cudie spring.
It was doused with their cudies.
It'll get away.
The bottle was the same.
I think it was like a two in one
because they grew up in a poor community.
So the repellent came in the cudie bottle?
I think it was the same thing.
Like, perch.
Okay, okay.
You know, I think that was,
I think that was detangler,
but they called it cudie.
Cudie bottle.
No, it was on the bottle.
It was cudie slash Pokey repellent,
you know, two in one like perch.
So they were repelling you and Pokemon.
Oh, okay.
No, no.
Okay, it's Pokey.
He was the original Pokemon.
This was long before Pokemon.
Yeah, no, I was the original Pokemon.
I was a different kind of monster.
Thankfully, it had nothing to do with anybody's
Pokey's.
Step to zone with the hole in it.
Thankfully, not that either.
That's a hole you don't appear to be able to dig out from.
So thankfully, not that either.
So how many people in here have to have
give you one of seven license?
Park one of seven license?
107.
It's the license to be able to fly RC airplanes
or AKA unmanned aerial vehicles drones.
I don't, but I just bought a drone and I'm going to fly it illegally.
But you only need it.
That's the reason I have to have a license.
If it's above a certain size, right?
Yeah, if it's above 200, 150 kilograms, I think.
Or grams.
Right.
Hold on, programs.
That was, that was a paradoxical thing to say.
Would you, would you care to what paradox did I say?
You said that that's the reason you have to have a license.
Because you refuse to follow any kind of ideals that
fly near a regular plane or flying over people.
That has no effect on you in licenses.
You're saying that I should have to have a license like you do.
But it's not the reason that you have to have a license.
Don't blame me for that.
Well, no.
I mean, there, there are reasons like, you know,
people flying in the path of an airplane landing.
That's the reason the FAA is going, oh, by the way,
you have to have a license now.
But you just said it was my fault.
Yeah, so to the extent of your, your example,
you just accused me of that.
I don't appreciate it.
I forgive you.
Okay, I don't appreciate it.
I very much request your, your forgiveness.
It's true.
As long as you're not flying in front of a regular plane
and or endangering people, then you are not the problem.
No, need to ask for my forgiveness.
I just already gave it to you.
No, of course, I wouldn't do that.
That's, that's all.
I think it was going to endanger anyone.
It would be me.
Even if I crashed into, it was not going to hurt Kaffat, George.
Even if I crashed into the teddy bear,
all it's going to do is get tangled, you know,
probably not even that, probably just bounce off.
You can't fuck with the teddy bear.
The weird thing about the,
I'm sorry, we're not getting into furries here.
The weird thing about,
I think what exactly what they were talking about,
getting into furries.
The weird thing about the drone that I bought
and it's just like the teddy bear,
the two red lights are in front,
and the two yellow are in back.
The two red lights are in front.
You have a teddy bear drone?
You have a teddy bear with two lights in the back?
No, I just have a drone.
George has the teddy bear.
Haven't you guys been paying attention?
I mean, there was somebody,
there was somebody who stuffed an animal
and put it on the outside of their drone.
So yeah, I guess I could see that.
Yes, they did that in Scar Seglars books.
Awesome, awesome books.
Which of Scar Seglars books?
That one was in the most recent
interstitial of the Galactic football series.
And I'm saying the longest way
so that I can try to remember the name of it.
I forget the name of it.
So one with Quentin Barnes' dad
was the captain of the ship called the Oleron.
And Zan was the, like, so-
Well, I haven't been into the intergalactic of a football
in a while.
I have heard of it.
Oh, they're the best ones.
Olerons, like, when he first started this series.
Well, he redid the first one.
If you've heard the first one a long, long time ago,
it may be different now than what you heard.
Well, yes, but he even podcasted it.
He made it young adult.
So we took the squares out
and for the football series, the rest of this stuff
is not like that.
It's very, very good, though.
The characters are very interesting.
And like, every scenicut is either
because you really cared about what was going on
or because you really cared about that character
in that moment.
He's just, he's really, really good at that.
I don't think we have a half hour time zone this hour.
If we did, coming up, have you read a book series
called Zone Wars?
No, no, shouldn't.
I don't do a lot of reading.
I listen to audiobooks.
It's an audiobook.
All I do is audio books.
I don't listen to audiobooks.
I have to read.
Well, some of the singular stuff you might have
still been able to get it on whatever replaced.
It's definitely on, it's on Amazon's thing.
Audible.
The old thing that it was on, what was it?
Audio books.
Yeah, I got it when it was on part of your book.
Okay, so a lot of them on part of your books are great.
A lot of them that came out on his podcast are great.
And they're still great.
He's still podcasting books.
They're still really, really cool.
Then the rest are going to be on Audible
or I have hard backs, dude.
I have hardcover copies.
And I have duplicates of several of them
because I'm trying to give my library a complete set.
Yeah, okay, the Zone Wars series is by John Conroe.
Is it on Audible or is it somewhere else that I can listen to?
Oh, I do believe it.
It's on Audible.
Let me check.
I thought it was the first day that I've ever heard of a
audio book.
No, audio books was awesome.
And then anyway, so, so awesome.
Great way to, you know, listen to up and coming authors.
Not just up and coming authors.
You scoop masters.
Yeah.
So Scott Siggler is one that I would consider a master.
Michael Jackson was doing it.
It was still early in his career, wasn't it?
Yeah, absolutely, of course.
But there were others who were later in the,
the only one I can think of is Corey Dockero.
But there were some who were doing it later in their career as well.
I just, I just wanted to throw out a few of these masters
that came out of it.
Scott Siggler, Nathan Lowell, phenomenal.
Michael J. Sullivan, his book, his first book was great.
The ones on Audible are not quite as good.
And they really don't, they go for a long time.
If you need to fill some hours, Michael J. Sullivan.
But the, the first one that he did on, on audio books,
it scribbled, scribbled is the name of the website now
that took over all the, it's the same people, same.
Yeah, but they were charging, weren't they?
Some of them are charged, some of them are not.
So it just depends on what it is.
The stuff that was on audio books will always be free on there.
That's what they said when they changed over.
So if you want audio book stuff, it's still there.
It's still free.
And the stuff that they're asking for money for,
the money is based on its popularity at the moment.
So I mean, wait a few months.
Well, and if you get a recommendation,
your buddy wouldn't tell you to try this out for three bucks.
If it was worth, not worth your time,
the money is a piton to some people.
I'm doing okay this year, sorry.
Yeah, I'm doing okay this year, but not every year.
I'm doing pretty crappy this year.
Well, I have a job.
And you actually just got a promotion, didn't you?
Well, promotion doesn't come with a raise.
It does not come with a raise.
And I took an 8% pay cut.
So I can eventually get a 3% pay rise.
The 8% pay cuts are a big stupid frickin' kerfuffle.
Dude, you sound like you're willing to do that.
How's that?
I was about to say you're doing it wrong for you a job.
That depends on how much you want to pay me.
And what you need and what you're willing to do,
but it sounds like just walking in the door.
You'd have enough to get done what my boss needs.
Well, right now, my pay went the 8% pay cut.
My pay went from what I've been drinking
and y'all want me to math.
Yeah, no.
Yeah, no, you can, no, that's best not to mess it.
My pay went from 114,000 a year to 106,000 a year.
Give or take.
And while not including my VA disability,
which adds about another $8,000 a year.
Wow, sorry.
I'm not doing has cash.
No, I'm not doing two thirds that good,
but I still feel pretty good.
So no, sorry, I can't help you.
I also have three teenage kids that eat me out of house and home.
My three are grown.
I love you, little girl.
I'm just giving you a hard time.
You're great.
Yeah, that's when I was a teenager,
I was taught how to mow a yard
and started making more money mowing yards
than my parents made.
It can happen, yeah.
Yeah, well, I did that too as a kid.
I mowed lawns, I shoveled snow, I did whatever it took.
In Texas?
No, in Iowa.
In Iowa.
In Iowa, I forgot.
Right, I delivered news.
My first job was delivering newspapers when I was 11.
Well, he lived in Iowa, but he shoveled in Texas.
The commute was a bitch.
Yeah, right?
I didn't make it to Texas until I was, you know,
well, after a year in Korea, I came to Texas to Fort Blist.
We're from Texas.
That's a huge jump.
Illinois to Korea, the Texas, like, not only did he go to Korea
in the Texas, but it was uphill both ways in the snow
with one set of shoes every day in monsoon season.
I don't know if you ever tried to swim to work,
but yeah, that should have God, those leeches.
Oh my God.
No, no crab migration season in South Korea.
Look that up.
Are they?
Oh, thank you.
I will take your word for it.
It's almost as bad as a tarantula migration season
in Oklahoma.
Joe, quick question.
Don't look that up.
Are they?
Is that a real thing?
It's a real thing.
What?
It's a real thing.
Joe, it's just, it's just you me in the teddy bear here.
You can be honest with us here too.
Don't lie.
It's I'm the teddy bear.
Is the, is the piss fish as bad as they say?
Piss fish.
I don't know what that is.
No, okay, you left a Google that one.
Is that the one that's supposed to go up your take?
Yeah, that's a pee in the water.
Yeah, that's the fish that swims up your, yeah, ha, ha.
I don't know.
I've never pissed in the water.
You made an entire commute to work while swimming
and never pissed?
In uniform, correct.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, of course, you swam the backstroke
and made sure that your willy was out of the water.
You know, I say I swam to work, but we drove most of the way
there, and when you get to the tax site, then it's fun.
And then you got to swim out to the little shack
that we're supposed to be sitting in,
waiting for horrible things to happen
while we have our fake missiles in the launchers.
Why does this squirrel swim upside down?
Because his nuts float.
So he doesn't get his nuts wet?
Did you look up tarantula migration season yet?
No, I didn't know.
I started too, and I was like, yeah,
I know what, I'm leaving alone.
Actually, yeah, I'm not looking you up.
I believed you.
At least it's not Australia.
That's all I have to say.
I did see Oklahoma, not Oklahoma.
Arizona and a couple other states show up.
So I was like, ah, you know what, I'll go for it.
That's fun.
Yeah, at least they're not the flying spiders
that Australia gets.
Oh, you mean where they light half the country on fire
to let the webs burn up?
Yeah, that makes sense to me.
That seems like the only sensible solution at that point.
You know, I was at home with fire.
I was at a New Year's Eve party one time,
and it was a big party, but it was way, way, way, way
out in the middle of nowhere.
And one of the mothers had everybody had fireworks,
but one of the fireworks that the mothers had bought
were these like hot air balloons
with a wax candle underneath that you lit on fire
and it lifted the balloon up into the air.
And we lit like eight or 10 of these things,
and they just floated off in the trees
over the trees to come down.
That's pretty good.
You know, I'm not sure where and create God knows
what kind of forest fire and menace.
I've never been so personally terrified
and responsible feeling in my life.
It was awful.
Yeah, that sounds like something you do over a lake.
Yeah, I was going to say over the ocean.
Make sure the wind blows these out to the ocean.
No, we did these in the forest,
and I was the only one that was the least bit concerned.
Dumb question, does anyone here care
about the college football playoffs going on?
No, just the people that are gambling on them.
Go sports ball.
I was going to say go sports ball.
I have my.
Well, Ohio State right now has the ball
and is leading with five minutes to go in the fourth quarter.
Go sports ball.
And my go sports.
The penguins are playing today, so I'm not watching.
No, penguins don't play football.
That's true.
Penguins don't play football.
They play hockey.
Play soccer, mate.
No, they don't play soccer.
They play hockey.
Pittsburgh penguins.
Although I don't think there's any penguins in Pittsburgh
unless you go to the zoo.
That's true.
There's no penguins in there.
There's a lot of places in Michigan today.
Now you go to Argentina or Chile.
You'll find a few penguins.
Although there might be some nights in Vegas.
I'm not sure.
Well, yeah, but you'll probably
wind up married to one if you go to Vegas.
There were many nights in Vegas.
And a couple ended up at about 180 miles an hour
going through Death Valley.
That'll happen.
I was in Vegas.
A lot of time was in Vegas recently.
I did not care for that place.
Well, do they still have a they still have a do they still have
the Hispanic people slapping hooker cards in your face
while you're walking down the road?
I didn't see that.
I'm saying I wrote literally most of the Southwest.
I rode the bus.
I wrote the bus more than I walked.
That wasn't happening on the buses.
And when I was walking, it was more dudes trying to sell me
their rap CD than I don't think I remembered any new girl
handouts.
Well, my wife really told you an embarrassing story about me.
No, no, she wants to tell.
She tells us so much better than me.
So I'm going to let her tell it.
OK.
Yes, please.
Let's go.
Oh, I was just about to take an inter-picture.
Now I have to wait.
I was trying to get him to tell you guys about vinegar ruins.
Are those the pictures?
What was that?
I was trying to get him to tell you guys about his first encounter
with a vinegar ruin.
Yes, he thought, OK, so sounds like a really nasty tasting
mixed drink.
I thought it was a Mexican Somalia.
It looks like a scorpion.
It's in the family of whips scorpions.
I thought art is funny.
Andre, the story of my first banana spider is much funnier.
Yeah, I thought all scorpions were in the family of just back
off a little.
Well, whips scorpions don't need your boots out.
Well, actually, you actually want to keep these things.
And whenever you find them, people, when they catch them
and they put them in garages, wood sheds, tool sheds,
you do this for a reason, because they're a good bug to have.
They're just, they look like a giant emperor scorpion,
a black emperor scorpion, but they don't have a finger.
They have a whip.
Do they eat mice?
Now they eat black, black widows and brown recluses.
Holy bear, they'd be great and Kentucky.
I need to start selling those.
Even better, nice.
So the first time he saw one, he screamed like a girl,
and then he tried to kill it and got mad at me
because I wouldn't let him kill it.
I would have done the same thing.
Because it was bad as this.
It'd make it as big as the, from the tip of your palm
to the end of your index, or middle finger.
I would totally bring those hairs
by the end of the finger again.
That tip of your palm, the tip of your fingers,
totally something else.
That's not them.
That was a junior high thing.
No, that was a, that was a, that's a vinegar wound.
You could tell your own stories of camel spiders
and banana spiders.
Thanks, Moss.
Oh, banana spiders, I love, they are awesome.
Garden, well, garden spiders.
Banana spiders, I'm not 100% sure.
I don't do spiders.
I don't know why, but because there hasn't been a fight in here
in a while, I want to start a fight with,
even though we're both hippie.
I am not a hippie.
Oh, there you go.
Let's start a fight on that.
I am a strange person that would have loved to be a hippie,
but by the time I graduated from high school,
the hippie moving up in San Francisco was all drugs
and none of the free love.
I would love to be a hippie too,
but I don't agree with them on almost all political topics
that they seem to care a lot about.
I mean, I just feel like we haven't had to fight in here
two hours.
Well, I'm a flaming liberal.
I admit it.
Shut your mouth, George.
We have 15 minutes till I can go to,
well, okay, 18 minutes till I'm go to sleep.
No, no, I have been in a good fight.
Now I'm trying to do a grand fight.
I don't like to fight.
I can't hurt one of you, I was for New Year.
Hey, see, he's, he's a hippie.
He gets hurt when he fights.
He's shut up and let's just live this 17 minutes.
Okay, let's come by, baby, come by, yeah.
Hey, speaking of fights, the exact opposite of that
is did somebody say they lived in New York State?
I used to.
And so did George.
I'm from New York originally.
Currently.
No, I don't think anybody.
I've lived outside of New York for close to 23.
Outside of New York State or outside of New York City?
No, I mean, I've moved from New York.
Yeah, he's in Georgia in Florida.
Move from the city or you move from the state?
No, no, I mean, I didn't,
I lived in Long Island and I lived in Ups State.
So you didn't say it was Long Island.
Well, okay, when George says Ups State,
he's, he's thinking the hippie,
which is just slightly outside of New York State.
I heard that's New York City.
I lived in Ups State, New York.
You could spit it Canada and hit it.
The thousands islands.
Oh, I drove through there two summers ago.
It's gorgeous country.
Absolutely gorgeous, best time to go or is it?
Anytime there's no snow.
It's boring driving up by Canada,
but it's really pretty country.
All the wineries and shit.
I like the mountains better.
I haven't been there since I was a 10 years old, yeah.
And also the valleys,
the valley area between the cat skills
and the other one, the northern one,
that valley area is on at Iron Decks.
At Iron Decks, thank you.
Yeah, the at Iron Decks.
Yeah, the valley between those two areas
is unbelievably awesome, awesome roads
to just go exploring.
I do it on a sport bike,
but I mean, convertible SUV if you have to.
It's just in such gorgeous territory.
And the roads are so nice and smooth.
I don't know about the nice and smooth roads,
but if you go get a chance to,
during the summer, go to the Thousand Islands.
And it's absolutely gorgeous through there.
What state?
So right along the St. Lawrence River,
it's between New York and Canada.
The Thousand Islands between New York.
All right, cool.
Yes, definitely.
I will put that on my list.
Thank you.
In fact, it kind of was on my list
to go a little bit south of there,
but I'm all about detourist for cooler shit, absolutely.
Well, I imported my wife from Canada six years ago
and she doesn't want to get anywhere
that they might possibly be snow.
I mean, Tennessee is one thing,
but yeah, New York is a whole different.
Tell her, sorry.
Didn't Buffalo get like 80 inches in 24 hours?
Yeah, but that's pretty much a normal thing for them.
No, it isn't.
That was more than a hundred year event for them.
Yeah, that's usually what we get.
That's what we get in the way we trend.
They're worried about flooding now.
The weird, weird, weird thing about all this,
all the snow that they get,
that's usually what we get in New England.
They go, oh, we haven't had none of it.
We had one wet storm that amounted to nothing
and usually not always by this time of the year
our worst storms usually come in like January February.
Yeah, I used to live along the St. Lawrence River.
I was 75 today in Dallas.
Yeah, I am tired of the,
I'm actually would like some winter
to kill the freaking mosquitoes.
It was 63 here.
Tennessee is nice and temperate.
It was about 75 here in Japan.
I would like to retire to Tennessee.
I really, it was a good 68 degrees in Kentucky today.
It wasn't bad.
We had a, we had a white Christmas,
which is a very nice change.
Yeah, we're in the normal.
We actually had a little bit of snow yesterday
but not enough to worry about.
How did you have a snow yesterday in Tennessee?
It was like 70 here in Kentucky.
I don't know, but we missed all the snow everyone else got
and then two days later we got a little bit.
You just happened to hit a random pocket of snow.
I guess it was less than a half inch
but you could see it on things.
We don't get a whole lot of snow here.
We usually get six or seven snowballs
but the worst of them will be two inches
and then it will be 70 degrees for a couple of days
and you won't be able to tell two days after the snowfall.
Yeah, I live just east of Lexington
and that's, that seems to be about our normal.
We'll get a few days and then it just disappears.
Yeah, uh, uh, uh,
Miss Fighter, her solo fighter who lives in Lexington.
Yeah, I know.
I've, I've actually met him a couple of times.
Peter, uh, he's, uh, he's quite a cool guy lives, lives nearby.
Yeah, that was his first hurl app.
Yeah, I drove over to his house and met up with him.
Uh, while I was doing cable, uh, at a local cable company.
He was a hurl virgin into a divergeny.
Yeah, well, I really like Peter and, uh,
I think we get along great as long as we don't talk religion.
Yeah, yeah, no, I get the same.
All praise Marty Moose.
All praise Marty Moose.
I'm praise Marty Moose.
I'm a bullwink light myself.
You know what?
Sure, it doesn't matter as long as it's a moose kind of.
Mary Moose Miss Moose Miss.
Yeah, yes, that's it.
No more festivists for the rest of it.
It's Moose Miss.
Hey, that's how we got around the whole day.
A tea thing in the cult that, when they called this, wow,
there is weird fireworks flashed out.
I'm going to have that was really a nuclear bomb blast.
You just didn't feel it yet.
That's awesome.
Bye bye.
Well, sports ball, Georgia, everybody from that's not born in the US
originally and the neighborhood across the street from us is very white.
So all the fireworks kind of on the other side right now.
And it was just kind of like my neighborhood is like the quiet one.
See, nobody around here does fireworks except for the 4th of July.
That's the only holiday we've got fireworks going on here.
We have a number of fireworks stores in the area and it seems that the
Mexican population goes for it more than the whites.
Now, we have the literal largest fireworks display in the US just about
three blocks more than the 4th of June.
Yeah, we have the big fireworks special right before everybody else has it.
It's kind of weird.
But they're claimed to fame, man.
This past summer, we went to a metal roof and at the 4th of July,
we got to hear a lot of clinking and clanking on our roof because of stuff
landing on it.
Well, you all started talking whiskey.
So I just got myself a large class to tell them or do.
So I got the Christmas stuff, the holiday stuff.
I'm going to hold it all inside, not going to hold nothing against me.
That's like super popular here in Jackson.
I don't know why every time I go to an Irish park, you want something to
them or do?
I'm like, you have any Scottish whiskey?
Like, give every man his due.
Oh, this looks interesting.
In the sports fall, Georgia just took a one point lead.
And there's less than left for Ohio State to see if they can win the game.
How much do you have on the game?
I have nothing on the game.
I basically, I had the household loan me 20 bucks at the beginning of football season.
And I basically bet on it until I ran out after repaying the 20 bucks.
So I was good for I think nine weeks.
But when I ran out of money, I ran out of money.
I am very responsible of these things.
Maybe next year, I'll borrow another 20, who knows?
We bet the kids and I have different hockey teams.
So we in Texas, there aren't too many hockey teams in Texas.
Oh, I freaking love hockey.
I'm already in love with the ones.
So my don't my eldest is a Red Wings fan.
Ah, sorry, okay.
So my eldest is a Red Wings fan.
My son can't decide who's better the Rangers or the Knights.
So he he votes for he bets with both of them.
And my middle one likes a Pittsburgh penguins, but she can't bet against me.
So she takes the local team, which is the Dallas stars.
Oh, that's right.
They did move the stars there.
They used to be the Minnesota North stars.
Yep.
So we bet chores versus cupcakes.
But you have to do your bedding.
It has to be witnessed and it has to start.
You have to have your bed in place before the drop of the first puck drop.
Well, there's a team in Nashville, but in Knoxville, we sort of ignore that.
And all the predators.
Yeah, we've got our own little minor league team in in Knoxville.
That's really good.
Well, we've also got the Allen Americans, but we're in El Paso.
We have the Rhino.
Yeah, well, it's not like you can freeze a backyard and skate for a while.
There's more money than since in some places.
Yeah, hockey teams in Florida.
Oh my God.
Dude, you got to give him credit.
At least they got stamp coast out there.
Yeah, at least he said they got a good hockey player in Florida.
They got one.
Yeah, so the whole thing is that's how we do it.
And I usually get the chores that nobody wants done.
And my daughter has learned that if she bets against me, the red wings always lose.
But if she doesn't bet against me, the red wings win.
So you don't go for the Maple Leafs, eh?
And I have standards.
I do too.
They're just very low.
Well, if you're cheering for the Maple Leafs, said, yeah, you definitely got low standards.
Probably a cheat date, too.
Our legs have kind of, kind of sounds like if you go for the red wings, I guess you go for the Browns.
Well, see, the Browns are the local team here, though.
Yes, I live in Knoxville.
So does the owner of the Browns.
Well, when we were in El Paso, we were just, we kind of called the local team could either be the Colorado.
It could be Phoenix or it could be Dallas, but Dallas was 13 hours away and Phoenix and Colorado were 9 hours.
Well, they left the Browns in Cleveland for the simple reason that they couldn't outdraw the balls.
Is it kind of like being a Cubs fan to the Browns fans?
Well, I am a Cubs fan.
I've been a Cubs fan for a lot of years, a long time before they even got close to the series.
I thought that you were going to say that they were fans since the last time.
No, well, not that.
I haven't been around that long, Joe, but the Cubs, the Cubs doubly affiliate is here in Knoxville sort of.
It's actually the severe bill of Tennessee smokies.
I do not know the Billy goat.
That was a bad rumor.
I never touched that Billy goat.
But you know that bridge builder, right?
I didn't hear that one.
You didn't, but you do know the bridge builder, right?
I do know that one got past me.
Build a thousand bridges and have sex with one goat.
You're not a bridge builder.
Oh, okay.
Well, I do honk to keep the trolls away when I go through the troll tunnel.
What tunnel is that? Is that the one in mobile?
All tunnels are troll tunnels. That's why you honk when you go through them.
I don't honk I rev.
I'm usually tapping on my brakes because someone's writing my ass down a hill.
Oh, you're one of them.
I'm sorry. You're Joe's wife.
So I can't make that joke.
Joe's wife.
I didn't catch your name, but I owe you an apology.
I thought that Joe believed me more.
I definitely went through my head.
Yeah. Well, when she starts talking about someone writing her ass, you know?
Joe's wife.
That's what I'm doing.
My name is Jackie.
Jackie, I owe you an apology.
For what?
On behalf of all the people who go slow and hit their brakes downhill, I'm apologizing to you.
I'm the guy who passes you in the double yellow on a motorcycle.
It's nothing personal.
Well, I'm usually have the family in a minivan.
And for some reason, everybody wants to cut in front of the minivan.
Like, I don't have any velocity.
No, that's no, that's not me.
I, the guy who passes you on the double yellow when it's safe.
It just, I can't see through you going slower than it's safe for me.
So it's nothing personal.
Okay.
Ohio State is infield goal range.
I've never driven in Dallas.
Joe, sell your mic is too low to be heard.
Yeah.
Two minutes in Dallas.
I have two minutes in Dallas.
I've only driven in Allen.
Two minute warning.
Get your do-do's together.
That's, yeah.
That's my time zone too.
I already dropped off my do-do's.
I don't need to do anymore.
Actually, a minute and a half warning.
Is there anybody who has ever driven over the Cincinnati bridge between Kentucky and Cincinnati?
Yes.
The next time we drive over it, gun it because that bridge is about 30 years overdue for a rebuild.
So we want to go with that.
Let's go with the 100,000 years overdue for a super volcano.
Yellowstone called era.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.
It's gonna be over so quick.
Hey, I've been the Florence y'all.
Yeah.
I'm not sure how many people know about that.
Yeah, the water tower that has Florence y'all.
Well, it originally said Florence mall and they got told that that was a violation of the sign ordinance.
Yeah.
And then they said Florence y'all and then they were like, well, fuck it.
Just leave it.
Well, Florence y'all doesn't advertising anything.
True.
Except Florence.
And how much of a Hickville it is.
Yeah.
Well, I've been through the early number of times.
I lived in Detroit for four and a half years, which I am ashamed of.
Except I did get one really, really good friend out of it.
Don't never be ashamed of where you lived.
That's not always your fault.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
And at the same time, don't hold it against somebody else.
Well, when I freed myself from exile, I went to Greenville, South Carolina.
And I've been somewhere around the smokies ever since the only time zone that matter.
You're going into the new year.
Yeah.
No.
Was it?
I'm sorry, Joe.
Was it?
No, Ellie.
I'm so bad with names.
I'm sorry.
Jackie.
Jackie.
I'm sorry.
Jackie, we do it for every...
And Ohio State missed the field goal.
So Georgia wins the game.
Jackie, we do it for every midnight in every time zone.
We get once an hour for the whole world.
I know.
This is the first rodeo baby.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.
It's the way you said that.
It sounded like you weren't sure.
I was doing a lot.
What time zone are we on?
That was more of the thing in East Coast, right?
Yes.
I wasn't looking at a clock, so I wasn't.
I'm not really sure what time it is.
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
The 12-1 Eastern time zone.
Well, this year can't get any worse than last year.
I lost my mother in 2022.
So I'm like, yeah, we're good.
Let's just carry on and get going.
Don't tempt the fate that way, sir.
I'll give you mine.
That'll be worse.
Dude, I've lost everything that could ever
other than my daughter and my wife.
And I'm like, yeah, I don't think there's any...
Well, don't be dangling your daughter and your wife
out in front of fate and go out.
Yeah, make it worse.
You think they're knocking on the standwood.
Throw it off of your shoulder.
Throw a pinch of salt over.
Moss, your cancer routine is even better this year than last year.
I'm back.
I had to go kiss my wife.
Didn't have anyone else's to kiss, so...
Thought the rest of us all sneak out and kiss our wives.
Well, I guess you'll do.
We got snap crackle pop going off outside.
We've got one kitty that is a security cat.
He is a sweetheart, but anyways, he just...
He spends a lot of his time under the kitchen sink.
Oh.
I mean, we went on a trip for five days
and had our neighbor come over and just a couple of times
change the cat box so it didn't get too nasty
and make sure they had water.
And he never saw.
Grandma, he was afraid that he'd gotten out and he'd lost them.
He said, I'll never do that again.
I was afraid I lost your cat.
That sounds like dog, man.
At the risk of making this feline public radios,
New Year's Eve show.
Welcome back.
My PR.
My wife got this kitten.
It is the cutest cat.
I thought he was ugly at first.
He looks his head is huge, his forehead is huge.
Yeah.
And he looks malformed.
And I'm like, I don't know about this thing.
But he's actually so cute.
He gets away with mother, effing, and...
Oh, yeah.
He's just, no matter what he does.
He just looks up at you and goes,
love me.
And then he needs your meat cap with razor blades and needles.
Yeah.
No, they're called murder m...
Murder m...
That's exactly what mine is doing right now.
He is making minced meat out of my arm.
If I...
It's just like, I'm kneading.
I need you.
And I'm like, oh my god, it hurts.
Well, our friend is a sweet little kitty.
He is now over three years old.
But he was a feral cat born under our trailer.
This one was feral too, but then rescued,
and then we rescued from it, whatever.
This one, if I ignore him longer than he likes,
he will find a way to climb up to my shoulder
and then headbang me.
So he knows I love him.
And then he slides down my chest.
So I have to catch him with my arm and have one arm business.
He won't just climb up and stand on two shoulders.
And he won't let us cook his nails.
So he's really a nightmare.
We have two cats right now and two dogs.
But Joe lost his princess.
And her name was Dog, the Duchess of Gluttony.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And that is probably the only cat I've ever had.
Cockblock me.
Well, the first day that we share him,
as long as she got to sleep on top of him,
she was evil to anybody else.
Like, even my kids couldn't even cuddle with him.
She got to sit in his lap first.
Well, the first time that we got Gremlin in,
Suzanne gave him a bath.
How he just looked at it and go, that's Gremlin.
He's just, big ears sticking out of his big head
that just, what's all plastered down there?
It had to be a Gremlin.
Yeah.
Well, right now we have,
we're for tonight.
So we're right now.
We have two cats.
We got a ginger.
His name is Galileo.
And then we have, he's like a calico,
but that's why you picked it back up.
Hold on, quick, quick aside and then back to cats.
Show of hands, who thinks that the cataclysmic
ending to sports ball being like 26 seconds
after the, the dropping ball is just a coincidence.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Go sports ball.
Wait, what?
Back to sports ball.
It's all a scam.
Is all I'm saying.
Can you play pickleball?
That's super bad.
Anyhow, we, we have two black cats
that are brothers from the same litter.
And then we have Gremlin, who was,
who was born under the trailer.
And that's all we got.
I thought I ran over Spud and I brought him home
and we were calling him Potato and then Spud
while we were trying to find him a home
and then he's potato.
Well, he's a white cat, man,
with his, he has like a couple of markings
like, and he has half a mustache.
And his tail is like a tabby.
And he has a spot on his back
that looks like a, a tabby mix.
But the rest of him is white.
Careful, because Mr. Miyagi said,
quick, just to like a grape.
Oh, yeah, we have.
Packing peanuts across the road and I thought I'd run him over.
I think I neglected it.
I think I neglected the mention that Gremlin is a tuxedo.
That must have been a terrifying moment to you.
I might have cried if that happened to me.
And I'm pretty tough.
Well, I got out and I'm like sitting there doing the prayed God,
you know, watch, wrist, you know, watch, wallet, forehead,
crotch, whatever.
And I'm like, please tell me I did not run over a cat that I did.
It was just a windy day and we just out of the blue
started chasing popcorn, packing peanuts.
Spectacles.
Spectacles, wallet, cigars.
How are you?
Friendly and I'm ready to go home with you.
It's like, okay.
Oh, that was the day you met.
Yeah.
Oh, weird.
Cool.
So he came home trying to find him a home.
He became ours.
Well, I think I need to go spend more time with my wife.
She's hearing me do all this, but she's not participating.
And now that we are in another year.
Welcome to being married, sir.
I don't have a reach that far.
I don't think we have any Bluetooth headsets now.
Oh, Bluetooth doesn't work.
It's it's pushed to talk.
I sent you a whole bunch of Bluetooth heads.
I thought I sent the one back to fix and I don't know about a whole bunch.
You had the one really good one and the next napton and the earpiece.
The wire is so thin it would break just by looking at it funny.
And the skull candies.
Those are really hard to reach in and resolder, but I mean,
if the if the buds are good, sometimes it's worth it.
I used to solder buds and connectors in the olden days.
And skull candies are awesome.
Yes.
You've picked my subject.
Well, I've got these sent.
Waiters now and they're fine.
I've got a question when it comes to soldering headphones.
When he goes to enjoy the Joe.
What is it?
One more triple drivers.
Joe turn turn turn it for gain.
Please.
Your your mic gain.
My Bluetooth headset.
Your mic that you are talking into is it's really hard to hear you because you're too quiet.
Well, I'm going to be a lot quieter.
I will talk to you next year.
Happy new year.
And hopefully I will get some time talking to Pokey in the meantime.
And I know I get to talk to Joe every week.
Is that better?
Dev random.
Moss.
You can at least email Dev random and that will forward to me.
Dev random.
At.
Sorry.
Dev random.
Dash podcast dot info.
Okay.
Do I can put it in text if you're going to leave the channel open.
You can copy and paste it.
Okay.
Moss, are you going to watch the sunbowl tomorrow?
Sunbowl.
Who's playing?
I don't know off top of my head.
Oh, I don't know.
Of course.
We, we bought.
We, we got the free five day trial of direct TV so we can watch some games.
Well, just, uh, so we're from, I'm from El Paso.
I'm in El Paso native.
And my parents were telling me all the, all the stuff's been going on.
The teams got their customary boots.
And my parents didn't know who the team was either.
We just kind of avoid that area of town.
I've never actually been to El Paso.
I've been across all the north of New Mexico.
And I've been across, I've been down as far as, uh, Amarillo.
And then across Oklahoma City.
And I have also been in the Dallas, Allen area.
I never been to El Paso.
Hey, you go for, you go for the food, man.
The food is fantastic.
Where?
Well, I'm a whatever guy so you can get me there.
Which food sit down restaurant food or street food or?
Just a couple of places that have been around for a hundred years.
It's one of the oldest towns in Texas.
Okay.
Well, the burger should be cool.
But, um, so what El Paso was originally was just the Army base.
And, um, they built up around it.
And then you have the University of Texas at El Paso, UTIP,
which is the first, uh, geological mining pool in the United States.
Over there.
Ooh.
Little too hot.
Yeah, little buzzing.
Little too hot.
Um, I'm looking at, uh, that link took me to urandom.podcast.info.
And that's not an email address.
I do not see an email address here.
Yeah, this will be a contact us somewhere.
I didn't, I didn't feel like there is that it's blank.
And I'm incredibly lucky when I can even remember the name of it.
I'm not the system that it's the other guys just let me play with them.
I don't.

Say it again or spell it.
Zardos.
Yes.
Apparently that took place takes place in 2023.
And they're, it's making the meme of the clothing choices of Sean Connery at that movie.
That was a really weird movie.
I'm not sure I've actually seen it, but I've seen a lot of stills from it.
Okay, still no one has pronounced it clearly or spelled it for me.
Zardos.
Z-A-R-D-O-Z.
Is that the one where he's wearing like the over the shoulder speedo?
Yeah.
Okay, so what?
So he made a move out of the speedo.
What's the point?
Can you hear me now?
Much better, yeah.
Yes.
Anyways.
Okay.
I've never seen that movie either to be able to tell you anything about it.
I've never seen it either.
It's just whatever.
It's a funny picture to put like, you know, a caption under.
They call it memes now.
It's not what a meme is.
Brought in kids.
Okay.
It's Poke at U random dash podcast.
I didn't know.
There you go.
Thank you.
And forgive me.
I'll never remember that.
As to headsets.
I um, solder a lot of headsets.
Yes, he does.
The current favorite ones to solder the earpieces on after 3D printing.
My own casing for them is the one plus triple driver or the one more triple driver.
Joe.
Joe.
Slower.
Do it.
Do it again.
Slower.
One more triple drivers with custom casings.
Deeper.
The one more.
I've never seen it before.
You speak my language, Joe.
I used to...
I used to solder.
That was me.
That was me.
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were going to go say what you're like.
I was.
I...
You gave me something to follow up on an email and still following up on it.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Later, dude.
Nice meeting you.
And.
Peace.
Happy new year.
is besides this one so we probably talked last year in the year before but how was this
happy new year as well last year before I didn't stay long it was so it was just shouting
over shouting over shouting yeah last year I left the thing on all day and I came in every now and
again yeah no but I also like every pair of LG head what neckband headphones that I can get a
hold of I convert to MMCX specifically because I know that they're gonna quit making all neckband
headphones soon wait what's a neckband headphone headphone that fits around your neck
mosque go sit with your wife neckband headset yeah yeah what is a neckband okay sorry
you I forgot that someone was getting us back on track look up there's one track I'm sorry
look up the LG HPS 770s that's a neckband headphone oh okay a girl at work loves these
I never tried them okay so what's up with them I have no idea oh man you you everybody likes the
true wireless ones I find them one way too easy to lose and two the battery life really sucks
is true wireless the brand or is this a no it's a type it's a type it's a category it's the
in-ear ones that are basically just the piece that fits in your ear like the Apple iPods
your all the generic ones are just oh yes yeah that I have shove in your ear have no cable and
are you easily lose one side no dude they've been the best thing I I used to solder headphones
together for mono headphones I would cut skull candy two XLs in half and solder a three and a
half yeah three and a half millimeter plugs on the end of each one oh yeah because I because
I just love have you done that I've been I've been I've done a whole series of I've even mentioned
it on Mintcast multiple times what I've been doing I have not but I've been buying these these
one in two dollar and three dollar Bluetooth devices that are with really crappy drivers on them
and yanking the drivers off 3d printing a new casing for it and giving it a 3.5 millimeter plug
so that's used them so that's you have no you have no excuse not to make an hpr about that
can we use here well it's it's a it's a fairly simple project I mean I do design I design the
understanding your head with your skill set it's a completely approachable project for anyone
with a certain level of skills and and you're right it's low but lots of people have no idea
that's what you make the hpr about you just go here here's the couple simple little steps
go find something that costs nothing in experiment and if it doesn't work no problem you've learned
something the next one might maybe I will please dude I'm like that's what hpr is about we're all
here in hpr is show that's what hpr is about it really is a simple enough project the hardest part
was the 3d design and and getting it all put together correctly and making sure that you can
take it back apart without having it all glued together so that way you can prototyping that's
the artwork part yeah and I've had so much fun doing it if Moss was still here he could tell you
that you know they probably got tired of hearing about it and he was yeah well he's probably listening
he'll come back in it yeah oh was it hockey talking about the entire about here my Bluetooth project
right how are you guys just answered my next question I was going to ask if mr. McGuin was on
chemo go yeah hey how are you good long time no see right hey there's go there's Gorkon do you see
him in the audio test room yes okay he drove me away from the Linux community one time and I would
like to tell him that like I love him and it you know I know it wasn't his fault we just weren't
in the same headspace no but with that uh hey Gorkon I was just are you here Gorkon
I am finally yes dude I just was telling these guys when you popped into the audio test I
spotted you and I spotted you in the audio test two weeks ago with the other you random guys
and I was just saying you drove me away from the Linux community at one point you absolutely
drove me away and I was so mad at you about it and I just want to say like I love you I forgive
you I hope you forgive me it's it was like stupid um you know it we we we disagreed on something
you heard my phone you didn't something and I and I took it too personally but you know I don't
I don't want it to be personal you didn't realize when we were talking smack about Joel earlier
no no I did not know if if you're telling me that Gorkon's really miss Joel no I had no idea
also I've been putting myself on deafened so you guys knew I wasn't listening for about
half the night while I wandered around the house so I you may have done it when I was
deafened as well well my apologies for that then well you're freaking do you remember what it was
do you have any idea what I'm talking about I have no idea so I came on tilt to promote the first
HPR um new year's e-show oh gosh that was a long time ago now yes and you kept going like so
here's the thing that you do it drives everybody on the planet nuts I don't know if anyone's told
you or not but it did it to me you go anyway and it's the most dismissive thing I've
ever seen any human being do and it's infuriating to me and to a lot of people who I've talked to
and it drove me nuts that night too um and and it's and you backed it up that night not just by
dismissing me like that but when we were talking about hacker public radio you were like oh
hack five yeah I know your podcast like that was you know 10 15 minutes into the conversation you
weren't even listening yeah yeah dude you were talking you weren't no people saw it people in the
chat room saw it um and I came back at you and I came back with some pretty pretty harsh attacks
and just in text it was shows later I was I was so offended because I came as a representative HPR
if it was just me talking about my own bullshit whatever do you smack me now I don't care
it's just because I was representing HPR and my apologies I didn't mean to do that but apology
apology sorry yeah no apologies accepted but I I want to apologize for like the very next
tilts I came back on it was in the chat room and full bore unloaded on you and I I apologize
it was it was it I had a complete like 20 minute argument that I came up with in my head and I
don't even think you saw it and I just I was so mean and harsh and awful and I apologize for
that and I probably cried but um yeah I didn't mean to be that way and I've already given you
a mask in for your forgiveness you have it so all right thank you all right okay then I hope
we can move on anyway yeah yeah careful there's the careful Joel forgives rich every other week so
I do you least pretend to I just finished watching the great game but my team lost by one point
last was just talking about that game yeah you know we were just talking about Gorkhan
have you ever soldered headphones together or built a set of headphones no I have soldered
stuff together before of course but not have heard you know also knows that this is once again
my topic no this is not your topic this is not your soul I am I am in my garage right now there
are literally 150 headsets within like 10 feet of me and all of them have seen my soldering iron
if you'd like to send me one I'll take it you know I do send them out I do send them out on
occasion um could you could you use mmcx I don't know what that is could you use a a or a
couple of uh Sans eclipse you know who could use the Sansa clip Dan Dan with love the Sansa clip
double in Dan yeah watch double in Dan oh all right cool yeah I got it I'll email him thank you
yeah Dan Fallon sent me a pile of them and some of them work but in fact most of them were
and they're not for me they were for me to to mail to people one of the guys I'm supposed to
mail it to I'm a lazy asshole because I have something else for him that I haven't finished
in years the other guy is an india won't give me a mailing address I don't he's he would feel guilty
if I like put postage on a thing that's meant for him you know but whatever now Dan loves the
that particular model of empty tree player I love to break in love Dan so much so hard in fact if
you see Dan tell him poke he said he's building haratches on his dining room table right now
haratches yeah please yeah please tell him that I've got I've got one set cut out one set strong
needs fitted and one set still in my head from my own feet yeah but maybe I can send you one of the
3d printed bands and the 3d printed casings and the 3.5 millimeter and an mmcx cable and then
you're like you're sure se two 15s are those are mmcx so if you look if you look that up and it'll
show you what mmcx is sure se two 15 thank you for walking thank you for walking me through that
a second time slowly that's really beneficial right now so what is your printer of choice or
printers always I should say well you know I don't see what's unique about this cable the connector
it's here is the connector that has like 300 left over right shoulder middle of your back I don't
have 300 right at the buds 30 on a 20 yeah the buds I have okay all right I have two
to our tens I have a monopryce maker select V2 I have an lgu Saturn and I have an what is the other
one I don't any qubit photon right now I'm watching by yeah I have the model price maker select V2
but it's been sitting over in the corner for quite a while now doing nothing because it keeps
getting harder and harder to get parts for see breaking up for anybody else or is it just am I
bringing you to see no issue so what is the benefit of this little connector looks like it probably
snaps in pretty positively and does it flex I like what's the thing about the connector is well
I make my own headsets right oh well I take other headsets I give them casings and I give them
that connector so I have the one more triple drivers with an mmcx connector on it and I have
multiple of those but those drivers in particular are much more expensive than the lg headsets that
I get for like five dollars each because they're broken and I fix them oh okay the more expensive
headsets that l I have to do is move the earpieces to the lg to whatever lg is charged at the time
so you're buying drivers that have this plug on it you're building the silver
hard drive drivers and putting that plug on it oh you're sawed okay you're doing actual solder
work in there that's no yeah I'm making a making a new casing to go around the
outside of that driver you know I'm taking it completely out of the casing putting it in my 3d
printed casing with an mmcx connector and soldering to the the driver and to the mmcx connector
and putting it all together yeah okay okay I thought the 3d printed part was just the part on
the shoulders not the part in your ear now that's also I also have 3d printed one of those
interesting well yeah I figured in your spare time come on Joe we don't think you're leaving
all right do you want to jump on jitsy and I'll show you the stuff I I don't have jitsy I don't know
dude I can tell you how to a website you know that actually really sounded sexual you want to jump
on jitsy I'll show you the stuff hey it's a little perverted you know I want to show you my
handiwork maybe I'm gonna get some handiwork done maybe it was sexy George but why did you have
to spoil it on me right I'm sorry right I'll tell you what instead oh there's hockey I see him
hockey seen most of my work so let me give you the the link and you can jump on here and I'm just
gonna go in the dev random room that used to be one of our days to be actually our podcast I don't
dev random room here just don't I can't let the listening booth try it yeah his link go excuse me man
I'm gonna mute that yeah I have been pushed to talk honky yeah that's right man I do
you can push the chuckle but push the belt seems personal yeah there you go I do have a project I
I've been needing this otter but I just haven't had time to do it um I got all the parts made
main mounted 3d printed for uh an Atari style joystick but with arcade quality controls
so with microt switches and stuff like that it's just needed I just haven't had time to
tear apart the old joystick because I'm gonna basically use a cable it came with an older
tarred pro line joystick and touch them right all right Joel yep hold on anyway you're gonna have
to mute on jitsy um okay yeah yep where is it it's right in the bottom of the center go for
yeah are we going to jitsy no no I'm just going to jump on jitsy just only something okay so it's
a sexual thing yeah yeah yeah and hockey likes to watch so it's it's more of a psychosexual it's
it's meeting someone who you know jives on that second level is rare be right back okay so this
is the the bluetooth thing that well I took if I have a box left ah here we go I took one of these
yeah we're gonna I took one of these cheap as shit like two dollars uh stripped off the headsets
and 3d printed a casing and gave it a 3.5 millimeter jack and a um shirt clip essentially
and uh let me see I just had the 3d printed no oh that that's honky so here's another one
and yeah that's nice let's make and then this is like a completed one right here
it's just different coloring it makes it a little easier to see so you can see I did this in gray
and then the outer I did that in actually uh both just you know a whiteish color a skin color
and so this is a neckband oh uh no this is audiobook listening this is not what I use for
podcast I I also use these but no these these are excellent for music seriously because these
are the one more triple drivers that I use and it's just an mmcx connection and these are
fog standard lg hbs I think these are the 1100s yeah so then I just have a mmcx connector on
this end and then an mmcx connector on this end and this sounds so much better look I switched to
doing this because um I fix cans you know yeah I like sound quality audio books
yeah well I've actually my brother my brother um rides motorcycle and um he hates in years
yeah we're we're talking on hp well I'm talking on hpr are you not talking on hpr you need to mute
the jitsy and unmute on hpr because my sound is going over hpr I am sorry I thought you told
me your sound is going over hpr it is now I I was doing the exact opposite I'm sorry I I misurge it
yeah so like this is let me please repeat for the hpr audience what you got there is a cool
looking box it's right um that I would have stuck in my shirt pocket but instead you're building it
into over the shoulder bluetooth holders right and you've got a standard connector to like a dope
set of homemade printed earbuds with dope drivers in them yes exactly this is fucking bitch and
you need to do an hpr about this right and the and the reason I started the reason I started using
the the one more triple drivers is because I got really used to um the sony xb 700s and their sound
quality with the larger printed ear cups and um also the uh what is this them these are the skull
candy um hash hash threes oh these aren't the hash threes these are the crushers I have a whole
bunch of hash threes hash threes are great because uh the hash threes are the easiest to repair
thing and you can 3d print all the parts for them and my kids love them but the sound quality
on these were so good that when I switched back to the lghbs's the sound quality was so terrible
that I just couldn't listen to them and and so I put a better drivers on them and that made them
usable again and between now it's getting harder and harder to get the one more triple drivers so
I also have been using now the samsung level use are a terrible neckband headset but they have great
drivers on them and I can get them really cheap so um I have a few sets of those I also can I
can I show you a really cool piece of um yeah here hang on hang on one second I got a step away
you know what was going to happen as soon as you started talking to subject ninja hockey
