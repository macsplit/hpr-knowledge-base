Hello this is Dave and this is Hacker Public Radio and unlike the last Hacker
Public Radio episode I am back in the luxurious air condition of the mobile
podcast studio that is my Honda Civic. I got it out of the body shop yesterday.
It is good to be back on the road. I like my truck. I like it a lot but it's just
way too hot to podcast in in late August. Anyway it is September now and the day
you will be hearing this is Friday September the 4th also my birthday of all
things but that's neither here nor there so I will get on with what I have
planned to talk about on today's Hacker Public Radio and it is this podcast
I listen to. I subscribe to a large number of podcasts. I have a relatively
long commute and I don't list the radio. I listen to podcasts and the vast
majority of which are Linux podcasts and the vast majority of which most of
you HP are listeners and probably listen to but there may be something that you
don't yet listen to. I subscribe to around 70 podcast and I got to
looking at the list of podcasts that I subscribe to in my BP.com file and
noticed that about half of these podcasts are no longer being produced and
they've potted it for like me know for the use the cliche so I've the 70 I
subscribe to half of them no longer exist only on a regular schedule I guess
I should say but what I'm going what I'm going to go through real quick is the
list of 35 podcast that are still active that I subscribe to. Like I said I
think almost every one of these are Linux related in one way or another I
can think of one that's not. I don't know if this needs to become a HPR series
but I always like to hear about other podcast people listen to it's a good way
for like-minded people to discover things that they may not have heard yet so
if you've heard every one of these you're more like me than I thought or I'm
more like you than I thought but maybe like I said maybe you haven't and no
particular order well actually I guess in in the order I did a LS-HRT in my
podcast download directory so this is in will be in reverse order of well I guess
in order of most recently produced so the first one I read will be the one
that had as a this reading will be the one that had an episode released most
recently. Tux Radar is the first one on my list and I'm pretty sure that is a
production of I forget the magazine Linux Pro magazine maybe one of the Linux
magazines out of England Tux Radar. Next on the list is Linux Outlaws. Next is
the Linux link tech show that is a live show I'm pretty sure the Linux Outlaws
stream live now as well but the last thing tech show is approaching its 6th
birthday next month that they've been around a longer than any of these guys
on this list at least. Next is talk geek to me is hosted by HPR
correspondent DeepGeek a very good podcast a new podcast newer than most on
this list I think next is distrocast this used to be source cat not source
cast I forget the I think of a source cast used to be the name of that is
it's hosted by a fellow southeast Linux best organizer Jeremy Sands in his
co-host next on the list is the software freedom law show I think that's the
name of it I use Bash Potter I've alluded to beat my bp.com file earlier and the
version of Bash Potter I use allows me to download podcasts into
directory my choosing and the directory I've chosen to put this podcast in
the software freedom law show is simply title frdm is short for freedom and so
looking at my list on my computer I'm not sure exactly what the name is I
think it's the software freedom law show next is Linux Cranks it is a live
show as well but it's it's also published as a podcast Paul.com not
necessarily Linux related but security related crap pound which is the
Cory doc Rose it's readings by him mainly so it's not really
Linux rated but there is some free software bent to that to that the Linux
user podcast not to be confused with my own podcast the lot of Linux links
dot com Linux user podcast the pedal it does this one chose a much shorter
name just the Linux user podcast try to do Linux that's a good one command line
that's that's a good one is well not necessarily all Linux but Unix and some
other stuff thrown into hacker voice they might be John so I guess it's the
one music related podcast I listen to and they've they've been going more
recently to throwing in more video and I don't watch video podcasts as a
robot because like I say that I do most of my listening on my commute Linux
crazy is another good one by Dave Abbott I think he's out of Florida Linux
Geekdom is another one I listen to bad apples by the one and only caught to
podcaster extraordinaire source truck this one is it used to have another name
too once upon a time I've forgotten the name of something tipped my tongue but
it in this one the host reviews open source software does a very good job
in his words he takes a random open source project and talks about it gamer
games and more entertainment radio is nothing I listen to geek not Monday geek
not Mondays is one that I listen to less often now but I used to listen to it
more regularly the techie geek not cast by not wise the going Linux podcast the
Ubuntu UK podcast something kind of techie for door reloaded another
Clot 2 production the Euclug podcast which is my own lug and I don't really I
produce this one I don't really listen to it so like my own podcast I don't listen
to it I just sort of produce it but but unlike my own podcast there's
something usually happening there that's more interesting than hearing myself
talk back to me so you make a lot of sense but the Euclug podcast I'd say
Carl and issues is great the Ubuntu podcast that's two guys that are two of
the guys that are rising the Atlanta Linux best to do that one fresh Ubuntu
did I name that one already I can't remember JWP and I think this I think his
name is John Wesley Pruitt I might have his name wrong but he does a podcast
ten-butt review is another non-Linux Ray podcast it's Lorddrak and gluten he
does movie reviews movies that you can buy for ten bucks or less actually can't
read my hand right of the Linux basement I have lousy handwriting that's Chad
Wallenberg's podcast verbals Linux trivia podcast and logger which is a Linux
gaming podcast by Dan Washco and at all those are the 35 35 of the 70
podcasts I listen they're just having to be the ones that are actively producing
shows if they're a podcast that you listen to that aren't on this list I'd be
interested in listening to you read that list and I will try my darn just to put
a link to every one of these URLs in the show notes so that'd be something
helpful but speaking of show notes there's a much easier way than loading that
then hand picking those if you want to listen to these and more all these
and more you can go to well maybe not all in close it but there are two sites I
want to mention that half made it easier to subscribe to a number of Linux
and tech-related podcasts that I in one fell swoop the first one is Linux
planet dot org and slash cast C-A-S-T-S this is a WordPress planet type of
aggregator where Linux podcasters have one page that aggregates all of their
podcast episode release announcements it has a sister site when it's
planet dot org slash blogs where their blogs are aggregated but you may not
know and link in the links in tech show mention this in a blog post last week
that you can subscribe to all of the Linux podcast at Linux planet dot org by
dropping this one feed into your pod catcher of choice mind being bash
Linux planet dot org slash cast that's plural C-A-S-T-S slash question mark feed
equals R-S-S-2 that'll be in the show notes as well another side I want to
mention is hacker media dot org I know droops had something to do with this and
maybe enigma too I can't remember but as a site that aggregates as well a
bunch of hacker related and Linux related tech related podcast check out
hacker media dot org there there's a lot of neat features to that site such as
being able to categorize what they've done a good job of categorizing all the
different podcast they list there this video as well as audio podcast so that is
what I want to talk about and I will leave you with a cool link a link that I
stumbled upon that you may or may not find useful netboot.me and netboot.me is a
site you can go to and it's a service that allows you to boot nearly any
operating system on any computer with a wired network connection a variety of
ways you can do this pixie boot cd usb tftp.net.me or your own tftp server you'll
have to go to the site if you want to learn more I'm not going to explain it in any
kind of detail but it's it's a relatively neat service that I thought I would
mention anyway that's another hacker put it radio tune in again on Monday for
the next one talk to you later
