Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
My name is JWP and I'm here to talk to you about NeoFetch 1.5.
So, I was reading my Linux Voice magazine that I wanted ArcCamp
and that Ken Fallon didn't win because he didn't go to ArcCamp.
And they came across this thing and I had been configuring KDE Neon for quite some time.
And this NeoFetch, it sort of does everything for all of your system information.
So, I'm sort of having to go into the proc and do the greater thing and make the file and then read the file.
You can use NeoFetch 1.5 and it'll go and get your system information
and it does a bunch of stuff with, it says, OS, you have your kernel, your uptime packages
that you may have, what your shell is, the resolution of your screen, what desktop you have,
what the window manager is, the theme, and most importantly, which icons you're using.
And for me, it was really important to know the GPU and CPU that I was having
because I was doing AMD and of course, the 16.04 Ubuntu doesn't have, you know,
you can't use the proprietary drivers from AMD.
So, you have to sort of figure out all that stuff on your own with that.
And then there was a proprietary Wi-Fi driver that you had to install and all of that stuff is just right there in the NeoFetch 1.5.
So, it's pretty easy, you just go and you know, apt-get and NeoFetch, that's NeoFET CH1.5.
And then you do, and then you do it.
And while I didn't think that it replaced top completely, it was pretty, pretty good
in the sense that it colourful, a little more colourful than top probably, and just as easy to use.
Okay, well hey, that pretty much does it for this episode. Sorry, it's such a short one,
but I just wanted to tell you about that NeoFetch 1.5 and that you can't get it with KDE Neon.
And I'm going to do a much longer show about KDE Neon later.
All right, hey, thank you very much, JWP, available at JWP5 at hotmail.com.
Thank you very much. Bye now.
