Hello everybody, my name is Champhalam and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio
TV News for the month of April. We're recording this a little bit earlier in order to allow
me to go on vacation, so thanks very much for that. I understand though that an email I sent
to the mail list didn't go out last week and people only found out about it today. So apologies
all around for the list community. Today joining me on the line is 5150. Hello 50. And joining me
is also Nido. See hello Nido. Hello Nido. Okay, as is traditional here on Hacker Public Radio
Community News, we do one show a month where we will run down the topics for this discussion, give
you a bit of background as to what's going on in the community that you may have missed if you're
not on the list, if you're not on the list, well you should be. And some ideas of some of the issues
that have been seen and some of the work that's going on in the background. But as is traditional,
we'd like to welcome some new hosts to the network and this month we were joined by Ross Wiener,
who many of you will know, Jezre, who is no stranger to the network either, and Helm Bitten,
who was new host for this month. So three new hosts, congratulations everybody on becoming
official podcasters. And we hope to hear more from them in upcoming shows. So I think last month,
we also, first of all, we tend to go through the shows that have been played in the last month.
And the last show that we discussed last month, I don't think people got a chance to listen to
was pair programming by another first-time host Christopher M. Hobbs. And as I said last month,
this was a very interesting show, pair of programming together with programming with somebody else.
Needle, I understand that you're a programmer. Have you ever done pair programming with any?
Yes, we used this at the university class in which we basically simulated, created creating
a big project. We created a GUI for some other kind of projects that the university anyway.
Well, we committed to doing pair programming in which you just sit one person is at
computer actively typing in the code and the other person is sitting beside it and looking at
a bigger picture and trying to help out when it is needed. And yeah, it works. It has its advantages,
it has its disadvantages as well. And well, you can listen to the episode again if you missed it,
how it actually works. Yeah, it's kind of over my eyes. One thing that made me consider though,
that from an employer's point of view, you're now hiring two people to do the same code. So,
but then again, I suppose if everybody's working on the same project, you have to see pasta.
Well, there's the security bit. And there's only one person who can edit that code.
If there's two people who can edit that code, then there's less problems with project
later on. And yeah, well, you have two people who are working in one piece of code and they work
about the velocity of, I believe, 1.5 people together. So, you basically miss half a person in speed,
in the speed of which you, in which you code. But on the other side, you have two people who are
looking at the same code at the same moment, who are also picking out the box. So, the end product
is of higher quality. And if you have to work for it with it for a long time, that will eventually
shorten your development time. Yeah, I get that. I get that. It was cool. Very, very good introduction.
So, if you're interested, please have a listen. Yeah, go ahead, 50.
Well, I certainly see why that would work because I remember back in school.
We had a, when we had a big project, of course, everybody would take their individual part,
but when it wouldn't work, you would sit there and stare and stare and stare at your code for
half an hour. And then finally, you turn, turn to somebody else and say, I can, you know, I can't
find this where it's, where it's not doing what I think it's supposed to be doing. And then they
would look at it for two or three minutes and usually find it. Yeah, actually, and I've been thinking
as well, when I'm doing coding quite often, we'll do the boring parts. And then I'll get somebody
to review what I've done in more tricky stuff. Okay, cool. The following day was an April released
on the first of April. And it was digital data transfer and looked at their one or sign model
for the physical layer in this case. And yeah, it's just one of the shows that I've been wanting to
do for a little while. So the following day was a talk to me news by DeepGeek and Poki. And I just
want to say, because I tend to skip over the talk, give to me news shows later on in the month, but I
do want to say that these guys have really been new contributors, narrators, I guess we could
call them GDT and News Team, as they're now designated, are really, really doing a great job. And
I think it's adding a lot of variety for me, at least, listening to the shows, going from Poki,
to Becky, to Dan, and then back to DeepGeek. It gives a really nice variety. And each of them are
bringing their own insights into the shows. And it really feels professional to me, the way they're
narrating the shows. It's obviously a script by DeepGeek, but you wouldn't really know that
unless you listen to what they said, as it was a script by DeepGeek. So hats off to all those guys
along the way to continue doing it. Well, I have noticed Poki throwing in a little inflection
editorializing when he reads his part. Yeah, and again, just proving that he's
you know, getting involved with the show and the, as well, the emphasis is there in the notes as
well, to some extent. But as they say, views of TGTV News is not necessarily the views of the
TGTV News team. And I think as well, hats off to these guys who may be of a different
political persuasion than DeepGeek, or may or may not, who knows. But for being able to put that
to one side for a while, and then do the show. So as I skip over their shows in this review,
just keep that in mind. Then we had Russ winner with the care and feeding of flintlock
muscle loading rifles. This was a epic show. What do you guys think?
I learned a lot. I mean, I've been interested for some time in getting a cap and ball weapon,
just I've found that it's too much trouble. I mean, you can't use it as weapon you have around.
You've got to unload it and keep it unloaded or the or the powder will corrode the thing. So
that's why I've never done it. But I didn't know the difference between the cap and ball and the
flintlock and why the older tech would be would ever be an advantage. So that that very interesting to me.
Can you explain to me what a patch was who referred to making his own patches?
That's just like a little square piece of cotton. For the purpose of it?
Well, you load the powder first as I understand it, of course. And then you push a patch down
with the rod and then you would push the ball or a shaped bullet down after that.
Okay, okay, that makes sense to me. But yes.
Because you have to have something to pack the powder down in.
Okay, so that's what they're doing when they do the pump pump pump thing in the movies.
Right. And you know, if you're if you're cleaning a conventional weapon, they usually in your
cleaning kit, you'll have a stack of similar patches to run through and clean the weapon.
But that's I think that's where the term came. The term patch that we use in the cleaning kits came
from the original muzzle loading time. Yeah, no, I've used a patch from cleaning rifles myself.
But I was wondering why you would use something for cleaning why you would make his own.
But that now what you're saying next kind of a bit of sense. So cool, pretty awesome stuff.
I hope to hear more from Ross who has his own podcast, The Techie Geek,
which is always always an excellent show to listen to. So hope to hear more on
muzzle on rifles and stuff. And you never know, 5150 and I might do a whole topic on the
subject of firearms sometime in the future. Yeah, I'd look forward to doing that.
Then the following day, we had a review of Synarch by 5150 himself. And it was I don't know how
relevant it was. No, 50 was a too late too long on the queue or has things have things moved on.
No, I and I finally figured out what my problem was. It was it was the
all the desktop manager that they'd installed. It's it's light DM plus they had for
in some inexplicable reason put on the unity greeter on top of it. And I actually found the problem
in a post to intended for Ubuntu users. If you have an SSD, it actually it goes so fast that
it's ready to move on to the next step before the software can catch up with it.
Where did I hear you expand that because I heard you're following up to that episode somewhere?
I'm sure I've been meaning to put it on my next episode that I record. But I've mentioned it,
I think at least once it's come up on KPO and probably on DevRandom as well. So I was letting
people know if they ran into it. What I had to do is I finally installed GDM. There was a way
there was a set there was a set up in the like DM or configuration file for Ubuntu where you could
put a weight statement someplace in a loop. But I found I found the analogous configuration file
for arch and it probably would have worked but it was constructed differently. It just had a bunch
of settings. There wasn't any sort of programming statements in there in other words or what
there weren't any conditional statements or anything. So rather than experiment with that I just
installed GDM. Okay. It was a nice review actually. I'll give it a try except not a big
fun. I'm actually quite happy with Razor QT. Well see they've recently in the last week or so
Synarch has dropped cinnamon as their desktop. They're going to go to something else. Apparently I
guess the cinnamon is developed by the mint people and they're not keeping up with I guess the
current GTK libraries. So the the the Synarch people decided they just couldn't wait for them.
Interesting. Okay. And episode 1221 was deep peak. Again we're talking to menus and this time
was Dan Moschkoff. And there's been a lot of stuff going on with the cues this month. So
shows have got moved around quite a bit. So instead of Friday the shows have been coming out on
Monday. But we'll talk more about that Malaysia. Dan came back to us with some mathematical
commands. The commands he was talking about was factor, prime, sequence and arithmetic.
And those are keep them coming Dan though. These I'm always learning new things that I never
thought I had had a reason to know from his Linux and the Shell episodes. And it's one of those
things that I you know I don't know why I would need to know those but when I do I'll know about
them and know how to use them. Exactly. I use the sequence one every day for for for loops in
bash. So I will do something like for sequence in for I in dollar open bracket and sequence one
space nine close bracket and you know semicolon do space echo dollar I semicolon done and that will
give you a sequence you know dollar item will be the sequence number of zero to nine for instance.
So if I wanted to count hit your episodes from I don't know last month so I'm starting it
in a 12 one two two two up to nine nine nine nine for instance I could do per sequence in dollar
blah one two two two nine nine nine and then I could make a series of double get commands using
the dollar. So I use that all the time. So the following day was Jesra with a short and snappy
show about how that into mimics and I think this is yeah it's really nice to hear these
shells coming from from people and there are a few people who have skipped them who I would like
them to go back and do the shows because it's interesting to hear how people got you know to hear.
Yeah I want to take a different take on it and it's one of these things I've been promising
I mean I probably won't ever get to my first experiential index was a boxed copy of mandrake and
I could get it installed but one of the problems I had are you had to decide this dial up days
and you had I had of course for my local network I had a neck in it and I also had a
modem it would set up one or the other but not both in the install and of course I didn't
without the bandwidth you know I beyond getting Linux installed I didn't know what to do with it
because there was you know I really didn't have time to browse resources online but my take on how
I got into Linux is I've got an old pity I'm five sitting or sitting around at some
hey hey hey you wish the show here well I'm just saying that's that's that's probably going to be
my take is stick mandrake on an old computer and see if I have any better luck understanding at
this time now I kind of know what I'm doing oh that would be cool oh definitely you must definitely
do that which brings up another topic that we're going to be talking about in the show notes
I'm thinking of maintaining a promised shows list because every time I go on IRC or people email me
and oh I'm thinking of doing this show and then quite often you don't hear back from it I know
some people's to do list and on that list high on both lists will be three or four shows that I
emailed inigma who was the HPR admin or the HPR lead I guess for longer than I have been
I promised him a few shows and and then every materialized I would be warned that maybe come up
with me one that is one reason why I always put in conditions to my promises
yeah people usually do but it might be the motivation to get people to
to do it and Ken Falons how to point a satellite dish is still in the queue and it's there for now
what the coming on seven years so
anyway we also had 51 50 the next day patio book report on Jake's Bible
deadmick and yes adding another topic to the procrastination issues to
our people who promised me shows is our very good friend Polki who needs to revise the book club
yeah he was just talking about it here a couple of weeks ago on on I think it was
dev random yeah that he was one of those things he kept meaning to do we're all
gonna have to reread the book again yeah exactly but anyway 50 I really like this show by the way
why did you were down the well I realized that was one of those cowboy windmill wells is that correct
well originally the windmill is all falling down on top of it sort of but yeah that's that's how
back before there's electricity it ran it was a windmill see my dad or my dad my grandfather was
was a air motor dealer in the 40s okay I'm what's that well that's that's the brand of windmills
or two or three American brands of wind I mean the actual well the tap the whole thing
topped the bottom with but mainly the gear box and the impeller part to top I almost
thought I never had seen one of those things and never even knew what they were in the movies it
was only later when I was browsing through the world book and to do with wells and pumps and
stuff that I saw how how those various different types of wells work so yes if you're interested
you could do a show about the history of what wells and pumps and that hope and at least I
would be interested in so I don't know about anybody else if you're ever stoked for a show like
okay I'll have to keep that in mind and like I said I or no I didn't say I meant to say if I
realized folks that that was an extremely different show for me and I was just in a different
kind of mood when I did it maybe I hope maybe I've got that out of my system I really enjoyed
because I was going yeah now something different now there's something completely different which is
which is exactly what you know HGOR is all about I guess and I do want to also want to take
this opportunity to say now folks listen to this and they probably already realized I had
three shows this month that Ken released under the old rules because I'd submit it before the
before the rules change and I did write Ken and said you know far bit for me to be less gracious
than a hookah and you know an offer to just go go buy the new rule system and and have them come out
whenever and Ken informed me by golly my my shows would be coming out I did and there's a reason
for that when a hookah submitted his shows he did it in the in the byline well okay back then we
needed we needed and we'll be discussing this later on on the show but it's there's a very much
a feast and famine with HGOR we get a bunch of shows and then it takes a while for them to
cloud them a shorty shows and we get a bunch of shows and takes a while to cloud now we're going
to be talking about that later but what I want when I requested your shows we were shorter them
and the expectation at the time you were under and everybody else was that they would be
they would be coming out quite soon because we were shorty shows then what happened was lots of
people going to your shows and we were hunky dory again but so I was concerned that there might be
stuff in your shows that would be of that would be time critical in nature and I knew when a hookah
submitted his shows he had already sent an email saying that he was intended to take the summer off
and that the shows were just going to be backlogged there and released them during the summer one
thing isn't quite so that is why you could ask and I also want you to you know put in more shows
oh I think I finally I've got my show notes together for once as soon as we finish here I'll be
recording one this afternoon oh before we get off the topic of Jake Bible's book Dead Mech
this was just right the week before it came out nightwise posted on his blog and he
uh you may have actually talked about on a show about Jake Bible and he was a fan and I didn't
realize I thought Jake Bible hadn't written any more books because no more shown up on audiobooks.com
but that's that's the only one the first one that is the only one's a free audiobook if
so if there's any Jake Bible fans out there I I meant to before I knew this show was coming out and I
meant to uh send Ken an amendment to the show notes and I didn't get it done because I procrastinate
before before the show was released so I did add those links in in comments on on the comment section
for that show so it should there's a link to nightwise this article and there's also a link to Jake
Jake Bible site where you can where you can buy the two sequels cool very good and if anybody has
in print form oh yeah and if anybody has updates to show notes feel free to send an amendment
in and we can update and quite easy it's not a problem oh by the way is that book very scary
in in a way but it's it's more like uh you know uh there's there's some humor in it and camaraderie
you know between between uh you know uh this sort of typical buddy you know thing uh you know
how I'm not explaining it right but uh you know the camaraderie we sit between soldiers
and you know uh them kid and each other and so if you're asking if it's if it's appropriate for
younger children there you know there there are uh definitely adult themes in that book that
should not you know no I'm not asking that because I firm believer in watching whatever it is
my kids watch before they watch it because I'm the best determinator for what the kids are able to
handle at any particular time no the reason I'm asking is that uh I listened to audiobooks
on my way home from work and I have to walk past and through a graveyard so I hope to be scary
shitless I'd say it's throwing in a lot of places I'm not sure I would say that it's terribly scary
but I'm a quimp 5150 anyway moving on and my quimp would my quimp would decide for home we had
second part of Tracy Hall's modern survival is in part two and this one was to do with fish and a
in loop back system where you uh do aquaponics and then a uh you have a aquaponics water is fed
it are nurtured by the waste by products of fish and then you can eat the fish and that's a whole
production system I actually saw a video on one of my favorite sites thebestofyoutube.com
sometime ago about a chap who was um big intact aquaponics in a sort of parking lot in the states that
was otherwise a you know Dirlix home for agriculture and was uh growing uh quite a lot of stuff
and had our green holes connected to Linux machines that uh was able to manage them via Android
and all the rest of that good stuff so found this one very interesting as well oh yeah this is
what it really got me thinking and and right last month I'd seen something on a smaller scale
be a good kids project uh much smaller scale but somebody's making a 3d printed like fish ball
for just normal tropical fish not eating fish but had uh growing mushrooms on top of it
in one of these uh symbiotic systems and of course you wouldn't I'm certain you wouldn't have to buy
their 3d printed fish bowl but I sent that along to the superintendent of the school that I do
service for because he has fish and I thought he would really be interested in it but uh Tracy's
opened up a whole new thing on this scale you know it's got me thinking I mean I don't know if I
want fish three times a week but uh it uh I at listing this I was worth it well could I do that
you know with slightly slightly colder climate than he is but I was thinking see we've got
enclosed porch built in built on the house and originally it's filled with concrete now originally
there was like a garden area inside that in other words there was you know you had to floor and
there were a couple open dirt sections and I I was regretting that those have been had been
concreted in because I was like well that'd be a great place to sink the fish tanks into yeah exactly
all that thing about uh needle nose thing about aquaponics here it's very big in the uh illegal
marijuana growing uh trade over here so uh I imagine if you start buying aquaponics supplies
you would uh a flag or two would come up with a police station yeah mine he's my uh he's in the
last few days he's posted a few pictures on g plus on how he's starting to build his own out out
of the plastic barrels and such can you send us some photos as well that we're going to add to the
show notes okay I can I can do that okay then we had deep geek and polkae with talk key to
news and we had a bombed up interview with uh froggy from founder of notacombs which was recorded as
a bad the icon include lumbus last year and it was um more dassy requested that we uh went
out to the mailing list and there was I think unanimous support for bumping the show up um yeah
good show great video can be there pretty good so um there is with the new queuing system uh
lungus release show date and sometimes it's uh Dave Morris was saying who's working on the queuing
system has been saying to me that it uh is um difficult sometimes to know when a show is
been released or not or why a show has been released so what I've started doing for now at least
until I uh find out if this is something interesting is I put a html comment into some of the episodes
to save what and the reason was if it's if it's not the normal everyday regular you know first
come first uh sorry not first come first lungus release date uh shows so in this case if you go into
the uh the view source of this page you'll see it is released on the rule one time critical express
permission for to prioritize this show which sauce I can provide members of the mailing list and
goes ahead in the queue so that's just something if you're ever excuse me if you're ever
interested what is uh what's been going on why a show is jumped up then you can just view source
and then we had uh 5150s show uh utilizing maximum space on uh butter butter FS and this one was
released under the um schedule with permission from the mailing list as these shows were submitted
under the first old first in first out rules so butter FS are you still using it?
yeah I'm still I'm still using it on uh both the uh machine I was talking about in my uh the
little uh arch laptop that I take with me to uh on uh on uh it works
okay again 50 and I've said this before and I'll say it again a lot of your episodes are
very much I know this is going to be uh something that I'll need to do but I was wondering actually
why you didn't just um make another partition and then or sync everything over
well that's another way to do it I uh at least don't on the uh root partition I was afraid
there might there might be files that uh didn't make the trip if I just if I just used
dorsink I did I did look into that a little bit uh hidden files things like that it's uh well I think
that came up on all cast planet somebody was at the uh about the same time and somebody's well you
could but they're you you may lose a few critical files and I've I've at least had that didn't
say similar something similar with uh windows trying to clone a drive if you just uh create
partition and try to copy everything over uh usually you don't warrant up a verbutable system
on the other end yeah true true true okay good point good point okay um then we have um
hell of bitten with uh chromebook acrc7 review and I know he was worried about his accent but to be
honest I thought it was absolutely awesome really understandable perfectly clear everything
made sense to me and uh I was quite interested in getting an acrc7 as well and um I was very happy
to hear review about it and some of the um the settings that he has in there about set keyboard
map that is quite handy and also about xr and r i use that all the time and work yeah i'd
he's uh i as i listen to this i was i was thinking well he's encroaching on my brand a little bit
instead of you know taking the big topic and you know top down and uh talking all about he's he's
kind of like me well these are the things that i twitter with on my box this week and i'm going to
talk about that yes there's plenty of room for that so excellent show well don't uh keep up the good
work keep them coming then we had a neo dragon who requested the show to go uh forward in queue
and the only person who was ahead of him in the queue and he was uh deep geek and they had no problem
about um about letting him through uh Stephanie kush and android developer whose google play count
was wrongfully pulled and so listen to the show to uh hear more about that and i i mentioned
doing as well that's um you know a car nominal and lost this source of income something similar
happened when they were uh they complained uh that something untoward was happening with uh
adwords and there was no redress that there would be all the way well that's a trouble when you're
dealing with this big sort of uh automatically running organization there's there there are no
contact points to talk to because that's that's how they're they run the uh company so
efficiently it's it's well it's like deal with retailers sometimes love your online retailers
there just isn't anybody royd complain to if you have if you have a problem or if you're not
satisfied with the uh product but uh yeah and if anybody wants to hear more about this we covered
on last week's kpo not the one that's posted right now but the one that should come after that
okay good enough but um i think they'll eventually run into issues here because um at least in the EU
there are levels of service that are guaranteed and the Renault so um you could chase it up that way
but eventually somebody would guess an oil didn't off to pursue this and then we'll have to change
the um policies first you okay then we had bubble vex and sorry and we did they did they did i guess
get it straightened out because she the uh the lady had her count pulled she made contact with
somebody she knew in who worked inside of google and then they they were they were able to get it fixed
for yeah but that's inherently on democratic in the in the world where we have now have mega
corpse you know apple microsoft and google whoever on facebook amazon the haves are those who have
somebody on the inside and then the have nots are the ones who are just on the outside periphery and
at least over here things don't work that way you know i agree i agree with you there because
as we pointed uh one of the things that came up discussion that these decisions are probably made
by an algorithm with no human involvement that generates the email and says we've cut your account
off and then there's no you're right there's absolute unless you happen to know somebody there
there's no you have no recourse yeah okay yeah about a point but the algorithms should be
really better I mean moving on um yes before we go down the rattle there again and then we had
bobo backs for would talk to you to me news um for the 16th of the month and then extended attributes
by limits in the shell which i thought was going to be something completely different and then
has dusted off yet another thing that i think yes i should have known this really also
else attributes and change ch attributes essentially they are interesting uh to count
colleagues with uh when we use them on certain files in their home directly when they left their screen
on yes and i have i know i know i know about them to know that that is something that can possibly
happen but i would definitely need to google it beforehand and now i know somewhere to go did
Dan do a Linux in the shell show about that in fact that's more and more often i'm doing that now
with with commands where i think i heard about that somewhere where could it be it has to be
limits in the shell and then yeah sure enough does the post there's the video there's a complete
explanation right and this this seems to be like most of these are system set attributes most of the
time and i i think you would really not not only need to understand uh what what the attributes do but
what the consequences of changing those attributes and see before you dive in there very much yes
the following day we had playing in ingress by epicanos and this has been an eye-opener of
talking about explaining every minute detail of the game uh i'm actually not sure after listening
to that this episode if this is something i actually want to do enough because i was vaguely
interested in playing this thing but i'm not particularly sure i want to know
well i i think if i lived in in an area that i'm of course they may be all around me but i doubt
if there's a portal within uh you know 70 miles of me to go play with but yeah i still as a gamer
i still enjoy uh this sort of thing and especially how this breaks out in you know into the real world
an actual an actual larping uh game uh i think i think this is just the uh tip of the iceberg on
what we're going to see in in uh gaming thinking outside of the box and i do want to say you know
it doesn't matter the subject epicanos just has a genius for for humor uh you know he could read
the phone book and it would it would be incredible no he should he should stick to actually giving
some useful information that's it's very much we've heard this claim so much i'm actually beginning to
want to hear him read the phone book okay fine i'll put it on i'll put it on because i want to
listen to it but yeah it's going on if he does i just go on might be another one for the first
of uh first verpo series that we have here in here by the way um if people would like to contribute
to they to that particular series then uh give me enough um nonsense in advance i had hoped
something else would uh would happen but it didn't so uh that is all from to anyone had long
tradition so um keep your ideas for me then we had a another um episode about gaming which was
Mike friend from over in vk and there's an app uh outcome and it's fightcodegame.com a place where you
couldn't learn to um like code uh write a robot and uh in javascript and stuff so pretty impressive
right and i i kind of got the impression from from this i was uh when he started i was expecting
a little more detail uh it was more an episode this thing exists and this is how to go in and get
involved but sounds to me like this this this is not the sort of thing you want to do if you're
just learning Java because you're going to get owned yeah but uh as he says you know the robots don't
need to you don't need to make them public so you can continue developing them i guess and then
uh the last show of the month well the last show of before the uh before the roundup was episode 12
35 talk cyberpunk to me uh seekflop wearable computers and photos of what she's on about in
the show notes um if you see photos of the entire units they're like a black visor that goes over
your face and you cannot see out of it or what she's done is called one off so she looks like uh
essentially a board who wants the better work um i hope she doesn't hate me for anymore than she
normally does but uh i hope she doesn't hate me for saying that but there's pictures in the show notes
of the whole setup and it's awesome and by the way during the episode um not only did like she
hacked this hardware and have it configured in for raspberry pie and get a working in the first
place uh then she just kind of lets it yeah and by the way i wrote a terminal eminator in uh in
assembly to uh to display on this thing you did what yeah i sort of have the feeling
seekflop is seekflop is smarter than all the rest of us put together uh definitely me that's for sure
but i yeah i i really enjoyed this because i toyed with the idea i mean well i i i always
love c articles on wearable computers and i think that visor she used is one i kept i haven't seen
quite a while but i had seen on loop dot com uh for what seemed like a fairly reasonable price but it
was it was always the uh uh the mac version with proprietary connectors rather than the general
usb or like said our rca jack uh version so i learned a couple things uh from this article first
it's pretty easy to uh adapt the mac version to uh for you somewhere else and secondly well
with the limited resolution you're going to have to be like you said you're going to be satisfied
with a uh terminal rather than a full graphical system yeah sure but uh pretty pretty awesome
nonetheless that must be said and that brings us to the end of the shows that we're going to review
this week so moving to the show notes there are uh there's an amendment that i'd like to
propose for the scheduling rules and it's to do with the normal priority ones first of all
and i'd like to add the following text where possible we will not release shows from the same host
in any one week so that text where possible we will not release shows from any from the same
host in any one week and that is what we used to do previously um before the schedule
rules change in January um and it just just kind of keeps the variety a little bit uh a little
bit long if you have comments on any of these uh on that we can uh bring it up on the mailing list
please and i would also like to modify the syndicated show one to to append at the
bottom these shows can be released either under your own name or under the generic host called
various creative commons works which is got a whole study of one by date so the entire thing reads
we will continue to promote new podcasts and other creative commons material but due to the
due to lack of slots we were only releasing material created exclusively for hpr
if there is a piece of creative commons content that you would like to promote then feel free to
record a regular show where you introduce the content and explain why it is important
and providing links to where we can get more information in the proposed edition these shows can
be released either under your own name or under the generic host called various creative commons works
and the idea behind that one is um quite often uh i don't know if it happens to you in 50 but it
happens to me quite a lot where um people will say oh really want to follow the show about this
you know i tend to talk about that or something so you end up supporting under my name or
or something else so this is an option to allow hosts to gather this sort of stuff it won't
be coming out that frequently it'll still be gone you know everybody will get a shot at the um
so for every cycle or post that goes through the there's the possibility that one of these will
be slaughtered out if it exists so if you want to discuss that um feel free to
join the mailing list which you should do any uh clarification if someone wants to
assign a show that they uh that they've put into the queue under the various creative
commons works does that count against them uh in the scheduling no that's the point you can either
say you have a show that you want to submit and that's important you can either
uh you you want to have a show that you want to submit but it's you know a TED talk or something
you have the choice of submitting it under your own name in which case it will credit it against
your shows so then once that plays you go back to the end of the line and you wait until everybody
who has posted a show um everybody has posted a show longer than you so you go back to the end of
the line but if you put it into this queue um that queue might be before you were after but it's
still won't count against it won't it won't be credited to you i won't be credited against your
count but um what it can be done is that we will put it in as a uh your contributor to that so you
will guess uh queue kudos does that make sense perfectly some of the work that's been going on uh
mostly by Dave Morris uh an amazing an amazing an amazing person so uh Dave has been doing at
law floppers not least of which has been the notorious uh transfer tags uh two which allows if
somebody of loads uh flack which most people do and if they put in the show notes and then which
most people do it will take the uh i.g. three tags from the black car and it will pop them into the
uh empty three odd speaks file and that in itself has immensely met the job of transcoding shows
a lot easier especially coupled with the transcoding script desk code cruncher started and we developed
with the help of um lots and lots of people in the community so that really really is helping
in addition he's also working on uh cleaning up the show notes to make them uh uh at least
validate Gmail um so that work is continuing on then on the mailing list itself we had um
post by um dupe geek about xslt and that we should use xslt to um as a way to transform from one
one to to the next and there's other discussions later on um which shows that yes that is exactly
the plan that's what we're going to do then there was a um posting linking to the various different
uh types of shwag that's um photos of various different uh types of shwag uh so stickers they hate
fjr sticker it's like a the uvh go log on a green but on a black background very matrixy
tattoos classic i uh i what is this i learned how to be nausey on uh the interwebs from hackable
radio uh a very very nice um a very very nice local action then we have uh Richard's the community
podcast here your ideas projects opinions we episode every week bumper sticker and we have um
focus hpr obo sticker and then we have um your ideas your projects podcasted t-shirts which by
absolutely want to get into so awesome and if you have live stickers or pictures of stickers
on laptops or if you have any of these please send them on to me please please do also i would like
and i haven't put made a note of it anymore but i have it in the back of my head that i want a
hpr-ish solution to the um photos where we can upload hpr photos there's a lot of uh requests for
that sort of thing we also had a uh request during the week a lot of skiing about how posting works
and we also had a request i think from you 50 on 50 about uh what's happening with new show notes
so i'll go through again what the scheduling uh guidelines are and i'll read it out if you don't mind
first of all time critical when a host has requested a show to be posted at particular time
or that the show contains news where the information so that's what it means time for
this option is seldom used and unless the reason is obvious the community will be consulted via
the main list or in urgent cases on the IRC so um if you're doing stuff please don't leave it to the
last second you can reserve a slot quite easily months in advance and then that slot is in there
nobody has to question it um so we get onto rule number two reserved slots this is where a host
has asked for a show to be released on a particular episode number like episode one thousand
on a particular day in that case it was the 50th or on a particular day 50th anniversary of human
flight which happened on uh uh 2011-04-11 or uh the first of april every year we reserve that slot
for that purpose carrying on ideally we always want a show completely processed when finished
with finished show notes before this is included in the schedule but in this case you should
have main attack of a particular deal with the reservation so that it can be added as early as possible
otherwise the community will need to consult with the mailing list or in urgent cases via IRC
if you are an attending an event representing which you are a special five-day slot can be
reserved for an in two weeks of the event this allows interviews recorded at the event to be
released quickly in general we would like interviews to be released quickly so if you are planning
to conduct an interview then please reserve a slot so that it can be released promptly after the
recording has been made so rule number three schedule slots this is where a host has been
assigned a regular day to release a show due to the commitments needed and the shortage of slots
schedule shows need to be approved by the mailing list and there will be discussions on the community
know each show has an issue you will most likely be asked to reserve slots for a period of time
until your slot becomes permanent so just note here so if you're deciding I want to release the
show once every month about x and then you will need to release that show for at least a few months
so that you are able to meet that time schedule because meeting that schedule is very very difficult
thing to do so the currently reserve shows are first Monday of every month except for this month
is the htbr community news and this show is open to anyone in the htbr community to come
and chat about going on over the last month is usually held on the last Saturday of every month
in the htbr room on mumble.toonsopenspeed.cc or 6 or 7 or 7 and you are welcome to join yes
everybody is welcome to join this show there's usually a send an email out during the week of that
show to remind people and on the day itself and a few minutes beforehand so every second Tuesday
is Lennox in the show Lennox in the show aims to explore the use of man commands a user can run on
the bash shell tutorials include a write-up with examples and audio component about the write-up
and a video component to determine to demonstrate usage of the demand the website is
Linux in the shell.org first three Fridays of the month is talking to me
tech news deep it leads a community of history of volunteers to bring you the technique
portion of his almost weekly podcast which editorial notes you should subscribe to then we come
down to so those are the mostly the exceptions so high priority reserve slot and schedule slots
the reserve slot if you're planning some sort of surprise we can reserve the slot without
putting a date or assigning anything but we do want to put in a htbr a number like htbr
i don't know 2000 if we want to reserve that slot or you can put in a particular date like
whatever date it happens to be or we can put in some text three weeks after glommokan is over
whatever yeah so the first three ones should not be used for the most part if you are using any of
them trying to do number two ahead well ahead in advance so that there's never any discussion
because then you if you have reserved the slot already before anybody else has even released
to show into the queue then you know there's no discussion about why you should be there okay
then we have normal priority and this is they this is the change that been implemented over the last
four months or so and i think it's only going to be next month we're really going to see how
this is panning out so normal priority we now release shows based on when the host last had a
show aired this brings new hosts and returning host to the top of the queue to encourage their
efforts it also spreads out shows submitted in batches and gives a wider variety of hosts once a host
is determined the first show uploaded by that host is released if you wish your show to be released
in particular order then you should make that obvious in the title and and by emailing the admin
attack on public radio. You can swap the order of your shows but this involves additional effort
and is frowned upon and i wish also to add to the end of that please be aware the following text
please be aware we cannot predict when your show will be out but sooner or later it will be released
sometimes a host will jump to the top of the queue while other hosts seem to be waiting a long time
this is because all the shows that hpr are scheduled according to the scheduling guidelines
which apply to everybody without exception so i wish to add that but that is just clarification so
it's not i changed to the way the rules have been processed and then the final one backup shows
we like to keep a backlog of 24 weeks of shows in the queue to use a reserve when there is a
loan in the amount of shows being submitted once this queue is in 20 the older show will be moved
to the back of the normal priority queue everyone is encouraged to release the show to this queue so
that we have time to send out to the quest for new shows it usually takes about two to four weeks
after a call for shows before the new shows are submitted keep in mind that the flow here may be
slow so submit your shows are submit shows that are not time sensitive and underneath that we have
this indicated shows we will continue to promote the podcast yet yet we had a whichever had
earlier however i want to speak specifically about this now seen as seen as we're talking about
anyway there was a discussion a lot of discussion about this and i must say i was very
edgy about this because under various creative commons works was the title and they
in the mail list if you want to have a look but it basically came down to a discussion
for an argument i think what would be is there a backlog or is there not now from my point of view
there is usually not and from other people's point of view if the show doesn't go out in a month
then there is so i just my response to that was because people are looking at the shows that all
shows are submitted equal but that actually as seen by the by the show notes if we look at the list
the hack-up-up-gradio-accounter.php you see there are 32 shows in the queue right now and
previous to that we had high priority reserve show numbers reserved by days normal priority shows
and then four hosts of also contributed backup shows however underneath that i had a list of
all the shows that are currently in the queue that have been submitted so we have a lot of shows
my hookah we've got some shows by Klatu deep geek needle basically loads of people four shows by
myself i think 14 shows by hookah and then and for people looking at the queue i can understand why
from my point of view they're looking at the queue and they're going oh there loads of shows i don't
need to record anything and on the other hand people in the queue really feel that the shows are not
coming out on time so there was a really a good discussion about that and to be honest i changed my
opinion and during the course of it so thank you everybody for pointing that out not 100% sure
you know removing the list of shows is contradicting the hacker ethic but i'm glad it was pointed out
that that it was an on-hacky thing on hacker thing to do and i yes actually i get the point there's
no point in hiding stuff and so what what there is right now and that's not to say that this is going
to continue like this is the show counter they list of files i can't remember who else that
suggested it are now instead of been listed there there you can get a complete list of the shows by
just clicking a link and then the text file of what the what the actual status of the queue is
and then otherwise what i think is more important anyway is who's what's the order of the
of the host that are coming out so right now deep geek is coming out because he hasn't released
the show since December of last year the 28th to be precise then very various creative commons
works are coming up with the show because it's been a while and then Johan v and then Nido and then
Charles and then Jay and Ahuka and then John Pope then Frank Bell, Klaatu and my bill David Whitman
and myself and then Sigflop has jumped back to the end of the queue because she's just released
to show on the 26th of this month so anybody who hasn't released to show since the 26th of this
month will obviously be ahead of her in the queue so that's kind of how it works is this all making
sense to people are you in board sense it oh i think at least everybody who follows the mailing
list has a pretty firm grasp on this yes that a can does not like a talk of more cues and stuff
are more more fit to produce then let's move on from the cues to another's objects okay it's
but anyway it's it is a bit it's a bit in it's we'll see how that goes now our my personal hero
Dave Morris has described with me and thinks that there should be a you know the amount of
shows should be shown on the website and epicanos has also described how dare these people disagree
with me i am the emperor no folks i'm not i'm just another host who happens to be doing this job right
our plan and loads of people are working on this get me out of the equation as quickly as possible
and to that note i want to thank everybody for looking over my shoulder and when i go off and do
on a but i go off on the thing and remember i need all shows on h2r are not safe not safe for work
unless the mark is clean and this one will not be when i go off on one and really glad the people
are there to pull me back so that's that's pretty cool by the way what he's done now is he's
looking at the queue and he's there's going to be a red bar bar you know a little like a speedometer
type thing do you do you use the word speedometer fifty one fifty in the state yes speedometer
speedometer interchangeably okay there's going to be like a going from red to green into yellow something
like that with a arrow pointing on the where we are in the queue so based for i'm it'll be
rather than to the end of the year it'll be the next while this is what we're proposing like now
yeah it's it's still under discussion and the mailing list so if you have an opinion join there
anyway so the first bit is fixed because my experience has shown that it takes three to four weeks
for the call terms to get out to people so it will always the red bit will always represent
three to four weeks so once we start not having enough shows for the coming four weeks and that
includes schedule slots and you know schedule days and you know regular hosts and that sort of thing
so that's also included so it's the actual number of shows that are going in there so there might
only be four shows in the queue if it's particularly busy because it's going to be a community news
and it's going to be a Dan and it's going to be a uh talking to me news that might we might be
down to two in the in the list but I knew so that will signal there so people coming to the website
will know you know what's the likelihood if I've submit my show now how long is it going to be
so if it goes to the middle it'll be about a month if it goes to the end of the green it'll be about
two months and then if it's into the orange it's you need to know that the shows you're submitting
will be aired absolutely absolutely it's just it might take a little bit longer so you might want
to think about requesting if you have an urgent show you might be thinking about requesting
another topic for that what you can always do is keep submitting shows and then you can move
shows within your own queue within your own slot as much as you like although it's from the bottom
that makes sense do you think that'll help perfectly yes you could always take a a queue from
augbot and every time someone submits a show you send them back in uh automated emails says that
your show is important to us yes speaking of crayon and people who have promised me shows he has
if you go into augcast plans on irc.frino.nest augbot will if you're searching for a hbr episode
will search for you and that'll do loads of interesting stuff and he has promised me a show about that
and a neat little feature if you type in .f it'll tell you if the coming weekend is a dev random
or a kpo cool let's talk about by data that's just what it is you put if you if you go to augcast
planet and and type in just period f and return it'll it'll tell you whose week it is cool very
okay um just one last thing on how postings work if for any reason anybody uh thinks they're um
you know they have a show that's not in or it's not being scheduled correctly please please please
if you don't want to get in touch with me i have no no skin off my nose it's water off a
looks back send it to the mailing list and ask the question you will be you will get an answer i
one of the core things that i want to stand up for here is that uh this show this network we're
all uh we're all a community of peers and yeah and you have a derailed death enough mr
cordominal our very good friend husband of boobalbex corresponded on toki can we use team
developer of crunch planning linux and all around nice guy has developed for us a android application
have anyone had a chance to play with that at all oh i guess i didn't realize it was finished
if you go to cornominal.org for slash demo for slash hbr you will get it it's uh it's intended
really for use on mobile phones so it's like a podcast player although it's a webpage it's a
it's a podcast player it gives you a link there's right there a little play button right there a
little download button and you can click random episodes and pretty cool you click on the
person's link and you get it and he even has a search page really really really awesome work
came out of the blue very very nice guy and give your feedback to him please on that
application on that application we have added some topic requests to the to the list which is now
i'm as well read it out because i am reading the rest of the website out how did you get into
podcasting linux eat them what podcast do you listen to and which ones can you recommend
what's in your bag the tools can gear you carry around uh your favorite android desktop and browser
applications look in front of you this is also useful where people want to request a topic just
email admin at hackphobicradio.org or if you're on uh identica or um twitter you can just use
the hashtag hpr and fire in a um a request on either of those so we have how to set up your own
blog and i think that is uh all facets of how to do that um choosing an artistic design for your
website or business cards and music theory how to install a bp new home an introduction to ines
and system d episodes and the lpi and network or network in series beginning audio series for
hpr hack and touch computers what they are why you would want one grow up to introduction and
customization fm transmitter hack to listen to internet streams how i got into accessible computing
how to do how to miss how to build a house big coin how to solder how to weld how to fix a car
review of stream playing software for linux heads who don't want to keep a browser tab open all the
review of stream ripping software and i just added myself beginners guide to good new plot so if you
have um requested topics feel free to send them in because there has actually been a lot of people
who have said yeah okay i'm going to do show on that so uh yeah you never know you might have to
wait a while but it will uh will come in sooner or later also and counter to what to what has
been said on this show reading the phone book was not an actual serious request yeah but
would be cool as an air proof is absolutely um i have i don't know if any of you guys have
noted it but there has been reports from various different people we've had reports that there
has been issues with the ftp servers anyone heard anything about that or experienced anything
with that i have but i haven't uploaded anything since so October so as far as i can tell it's
working okay uh today yeah i've had a look and um you couldn't find anything stranger odd in the
logs i did notice that some people had uploaded chills and they're working appearing in the log files
which uh i have to admit i'm a little bit worried is the rest appearing in the log files or are the
log files empty no there's some stuff coming in but i i don't i'm not 100% sure that that c panel
installation is correct at all cause there's um yeah we we have the archives are missing and yeah
it's just a bit creepy i think yeah okay then let's continue on another subject
okay um there's a memoriam for uh aren't Schwartz and q she should be out uh shortly
i also sent her on the mailing list uh asking on the mailing on both mailing list we have two
with the development and we have the hpr mailing list doesn't seem a lot of point to me to maintain
the dead mailing list because i think a lot of people are um technical enough it's completely
there's a lot of people on the regular mailing list that that are also in the dead mailing list so um
and i think we should approach the mailing list that if it's not of interest to you just to leave
that um that mail so i just want to make two uh from two just make one and then uh that will
facilitate exporting it to an archive system so we only need to do that once and probably it's
easier on you to avoid duplication of effort when something that's relevant to both less do you have
to post it twice yeah yeah and it's uh then quite often something technical turns into something
ethical so um then the ethical thing needs to be discussed in a hpr mailing list and you end up
you know with two two different places but um we're a technical podcast i mean so yeah
as with everything with hpr if you don't want to listen to a show personally to move on
and the same should apply to the mailing list and note to self if somebody gonna mind uh
she'll mind myself and i'll listen to this in a few days is to put a common somewhere
that you should do that notes to self are usually to yourself yeah yes but at least with this i can
hear myself making the notes and then my hands for you to make a note okay very very meta i understand
anyway we have uh yes the upload form is alive epicanos moves and uh the atom feed and all that
good stuff he has produced a XML file and he has also produced some php scripts to do the upload now
there are php people out there are people with experience in php or you know people with experience
i really need everybody to co-review this stuff as much as possible not because i don't think
epicanos is doing a great job there was nothing in there that i could see that jumped out to me but
if we have a pool of talented um developers that i don't want you know the site to be gone down or
some sort of stupid did us because we overlooked something that was you know silly so i'd appreciate
everybody's health please because right now most of the stuff is the only thing that we have is
the ftp site on the common system that allows stuff in and and this will allow lots of stuff in
on the on the main form page so please give us a hand to the book this stuff oh and by the way
another note i have dyslexia or in any event i have a issue with reading and writing
with text that's in work typically what i do is i'll play it back so that i can hear it's more
obvious i don't spot things and this is probably become very obvious to people who know me or
been involved with hqr but how that can manifest itself sometimes is that there are obvious
glaring mistakes on the show notes for some episodes don't assume that i will see them because i'm
physically cannot see them sometimes so um i will see repeated text sometimes i just can't see that
so uh please don't be embarrassed about it i just don't want um uh on proofread stuff on the
website it's not possible to get a proofread all the time because i need to do it and sometimes
i need to do it on the train in a hurry so um don't be embarrassed at all about saying can
be misspelling on this page or um you type this incorrectly yeah just make it clear and i think
we already i don't know if we spoke about it earlier but about multiple host uploads i wanted to
talk to you at length about this for a while back in when hqr started when um people most people
do solo episodes and then you have round tables like this which goes under the heading of hqr
admins um and when people got together to do a cooperative show um like stank and enigma did
what the very first episode was stank in enigma i don't know who who got credit for that but it might
be a show host called stank and enigma so won't you always with the strength stank and enigma
as opposed to having a show host called stank and another one called enigma and uh they
definitely kind of been the tradition to handle that and give credit to multiple people for the
same show type of thing where they've done um where they've done several shows together and
ny bill and jesra have done a few of these and then my bill is done in several different people
so where the show is like a a chat more than anything else the issue that though with this is
since uh we introduced uh two years ago they they knew show host so automatically if you become a
new host you get bumped to the top of the cube once so that and the idea behind that is obviously
to encourage um podcasters so you know it's your first time podcasting uh it's you get a nice
balls you put in a show and did a boom in a few days it's out and hey mom look what i could do
type of thing so uh this has been something that we knew we were going to have to tackle and i guess
kernel panic suffers from the same thing as well as those depth random um both in atom they feed
format that we're uh going to be supporting as our um working format for uploading the episodes
and also we intend to have as we feed in general for syndication they do quite well because there's
the the person who submits the show and then there's the contributors so those two separate fields
now um um what i intend to do is that um the order of the show the uploader will be not as important
anymore they will still get for the first show get bumped to the top of the cube but if it's just a
regular show that they're coming from it gets submitted under their own um own name and as i say
that i just realized that that's not gonna work so this whole thing needs to be kind of fleshed out
with the view to how our current system works and i'm also trying to flesh out in a relational
database and neither you probably will be able to help me with this um currently every host every
show is a flash table and there's an ID you know host ID equals and a number so what's the best way
to put in a contributor do you put in a contribute field with a comma separated list of IDs of the
other hosts what do you think um well basically we've got one too many relation between the
episodes and uh and uh what's the name the contributors so you you can base you can do that in
sql you can uh make make relation that way so wait you have multiple episodes so that's not done
okay let's i'm not really sure um i'll send a mail about this to the mailing list because this
is the place to talk about it but um just so everybody knows we know what's an issue we're going
to think about it technically and then out of that they will come some ethical mark moral decisions
to make about uh what's fair and then we'll put it to the mailing list yep since fair
does that look like a plan good ID okay then we had um yeah i mentioned about doing a promised
shows list and um yes i want to just add to the uh requested topic lists um about windows managers
and that whole stack how you go from start x you know you've installed base debian now what
you know the whole way of building a minimum window manager to get you surfing with Firefox
and yes as well as uh keeping me in check i would also like people to start thinking about um
how we as a community are going to rotate the role of hpr lead or whatever it is that i'm doing
um so that uh we're yeah open and transparent and that uh you know we change leads from time to time
not that i'm going to wear anything or um but that somebody could step forward and and do the stuff
that kind of you know manage out the mailing list and do they do the uh hpr sort of lead role
i think what do w in call that not sure w in projectly dpr yes well whatever that thing is
that i am we should uh people should have a think about that and see if that's something you're
interested in doing and um and that's what i think yep okay moving on last but not least things
before we get to the events is the to do list which hey didn't particularly want to put it in but
now there's here and let's have a little look what's the new stuff that's coming new stuff we're
putting in a we're working on putting in a show flow rate with average weight times so that people
have an idea of the health of hpr so that you can you know the green bar so you get a good feel
and yes for our blind listeners there will be a text underneath all the text which we'll
explain exactly the equivalent in hpr in text terms as i mentioned earlier we're working
we're we when i say we i mean somebody else uh for all of the stuff in actual fact uh when i say
we were somebody else is working on the android app and then crediting multiple hosts i've already
done a needle working on that there in the background on the queue for one of those two that sort of
continuing on is securing the website that's never ending task and as i mentioned we're doing the
upload form we being a pianos and et al and fix and the broken links uh is been done by uh Dave Morris
fixing the uh sorry fix and broken html and then we need to do fixing the links which is
something that i probably do and then converting to html 5 and css something which
for normal volunteer to do but i'm i'm not sure if he wants to continue doing it since i said
he can't use javascript which i don't know as a hard and fast rule what do you how do you guys feel
about javascript on the website i'd like to make as little uh no script adjustments as possible
so not having it all well you can do stuff with it but i at least want to be able to read the website
and get the information i don't need some spinning uh will beach bow or whatever in my screen but
i just want to be able to read whatever is on from my point of view it ideally uh you would make
the page in html and css so it's workable and then add some uh ht add some javascript to make it
do meet stuff yep that's kind of where i am because uh we do need to support um uh we do need to support
our uh lined and uh lined uh sorry yes lined listeners so they need to give them an advocate
to website Dave Morris is also working on the links in top net horalscript which is it's called
links in top net because Dan uh Dan macho the link who is the links link textual guy who is
links in the show guy and who should be in the links in the house guy um is we want that as a tool
for podcasters to go somewhere and see how their uh podcasting feed is doing so if it's up if it's
valid if the server is reporting errors if it requires a stupid uh browser tag that won't accept
double guess that sort of stuff that we have been hitting against uh as we developed that script
with some background for people who are listening it's a script that we use to produce a list of
podcasts um actively next podcast to hand out uh on campus so that you know people will come over
to the booth and we kind of want to just do that as a service for the community sort of like
is is my site down what's that cycle is my site down for everyone or just me.com but anyway
something like that stuff that has been done this month has been db database support has been
added for uh the summary and the tags uh we have moved the ftp server internally and there's new
links to the readme file and the sample show notes file in both the website and on the ftp server
so they have changed um 5150 you were asking about that are you happy with the uh the show notes
and the readme as it stands now. Yeah so i i should have checked the readme before i said
hey what where's the uh details on the stuff you talked about last month on how you would like to
organize the shows and uh kind of put flags in the top part of the show notes. What one suggestion
that i might uh uh make is when you turned uh the the script that we're looking at now into the show
notes for this episode that you make that uh where it says the readme and etc. make that a hyperlink
so that people don't have to look on another page for you know if if they're listening to this and
they want to see it. Okay yes good point for this or i will hear it myself saying this on the train
and then the show has already been out two days and uh then i have to go back and edit the show notes
so sorry about that folks of course. Yes yes yes yes uh yes uh search options have been added
as much as we can right now we probably we we revisit that topic and introduction of show tags
have been added and the automatic tagging of media files have been added. Just gonna read me and
the sample show notes thing the sample show notes shouldn't change that often the readme well
they're probably well the readme file changes quite a lot so if you haven't submitted the show
in a while you definitely want to read the readme. If you're submitting a show uh in the last
half and submitted the show in the last month you still want to check the readme um as work continues
as work continues on the atom feed and the upload form we're probably going to want to modify
the sample show notes and the readme file as well just to make adjustments for that i don't know
maybe if we start increasing the text size or shorting it or something so please continue to
reread those if something significant changes i usually send a mail out to the mailing us so be aware
of that stuff we still have to do is automate the presentations so that's kind of a low priority
introduction to the hpr video all the components have been done i haven't done any more in
us add an atom feed kind of work has been done on that and when the upload form is in place they
form out of the atom feed should become apparent and then it should be um easy enough to produce
atom feed from that the intention will be to start off with um multiple one atom feed containing
the all mp3 and speak with the hope that if a pod catcher is developed enough it is advanced enough
to support atom that it should be advanced enough to know what we to download but we shall see
we may need to split that off it shouldn't be a big thing anyway open support i need to get permission
to multiply out the disk space plus i need somebody to tell me what the best
encoding specs are for that and so let's not distract the pianos from his upload page
we still need to do an advanced page the twitter and identity feed need to be sorted out
we still need somebody to volunteer for the archive dot org so if you've got
um if you have got experience with amazon cloud services they they have an api or a tool at least
that behaves similarly for uploading the archive dot org we'd appreciate people's help with that
the automation of media uploaded identification and transcoding is something that's been
thinking about we've got an uvps in the states and we've got a vps here in the UK um so we might
start doing some more about that then finally if you've met it this far the mimics first north
west is on the 27th and 28th which is today and tomorrow so you're obviously going to miss that
then sig club says sent in a request to know if anyone is going to not a com on April the 18th
and the 21st in the hotel garden hilton garden in in downtown cleagland please get in touch
then we have the august planet alive event on the 27th of the main moral day weekend in Philadelphia
more information available on olcplive.com to make sure your employer is aware that this is a
high profile event that all up and coming businesses should be attending and supporting
i was really impressed by the list of sponsors yeah yeah that uh i was impressed as well uh but uh
all it's it's just going to be a few of us from all cast planet uh getting together we've arranged
for two or three apartments that we're gonna share for the weekend and if anybody anybody hearing
this is interested in in uh coming it's you know it's just uh let me know at my email it's uh 5150
at linuxbasement.com and i'll put you in touch with the right folks so there's still time
and was it if we came up with this idea about six months ago wouldn't it be great if we could just
get together and because when people go to conferences they all want to do the hallway track they
want to talk to everybody they've been in IRC with all the time and you know so so many times
well pokey i think uh when he when he went to uh north eastlinux fest he said well i've saw maybe
one of the talks i you know i was i was getting interviews i was i was talking to these folks i
only get to see once or twice a year and we'll you know i'll listen to the recorded talks when
they're posted online so this is going to be the entire four days without that pressure
oh they're they're you know they're there's conferences that you're supposed to get to in some
place that you need to be so we're going to do some sightseeing around Philadelphia you know
and it's just gonna be and just generally hang out and i'm gonna i'll let Ken know so we can maybe
post it somewhere and i'm sure if i have i'm gonna take my laptop with me and if i have anything
to say about it we'll try to do some live broadcasting from from there probably video probably
just like a g-plus hangout but uh gets closer to it we'll i'll talk to other folks about if we
want to to to set up something formally i'm sure then we then i can arrange for there to be a link
on the side otherwise kind of watch this watch this space you know and sure surely i'll throw
something up during that week but that didn't come out right put something on the internet uh during
that weekend because i i'm gonna be uh these departments do do have broadband and i'm just going
to be enjoying actually having a real internet connection for the weekend very nice now here is a
typical case where you know something's gonna be happening so put in your reservation for your
shows ASAP that way we can make the reservations right now and then it's obvious to everybody when
that block of shows are going to be common up on the queue that's thing number one thing number two
can we all try and avoid is me personally using google's uh products they're not open they're closed
and there is no open API to them and there is no uh way to get stuff out they're inaccessible to
members of the blind community and until that changes i realized a lot of good people in google
are not in there i'm just saying that uh can we restrict use of uh quite as essentially proprietary
web services that don't have um open components to them i agree i consider myself uh
sufficiently chastised for that so yes if there's if there's an alternative i'll uh we will have
is is there an open source video alternative like mumble with video or so that uh they
equivalent i don't think he got to do that i'm sorry needo can you can you thank you guy i thought
it also did video i don't know at 51 50 again this is not uh this is my view what i would suggest
you do whatever is have this because you'd be busy on the day um but keep that in mind yeah when
you're doing it so at least we can get feeds out of it we have a nice cast server we've got a vps
so there's only software that you need installed to facilitate this for oh yeah give us a shout
and we'll do our best to get some sort of at least open uh feed out of it yeah
okay i'll uh we haven't i mean the the whole nature of this thing is meant to be rather unplanned
but i'll hit the other guys who are are coming and see if they if they want to arrange anything
yeah but time remember as well that uh people coming platoon has should have access to the servers
and is has already done a nice cast series uh few of them are and they uh have been posted
in a few renegades so uh yeah i set it up and uh record what he's doing as he's doing
half the phone is getting the thing working in the first place also i wonder why uh i wasn't
invited to this thing if you knew about it six months ago hmm well we we bet we bounced the idea
around six months ago it's only been just about the first the year it's been a reality and uh you
know you're you're an all cast it all happened over in all cast planet so i don't know how you
managed to miss it how i miss it is i'm in a different different time zone and uh i cannot guess
lugging to work and i rest as i so if i'm there i see it if i'm not i don't and usually
it's kind of really weird anytime i'm an all cast planet i just missed the Australian guys
when i lugging in the morning the Australian guys feature 64 and krayana and i kind of
see for a little while and then they go off and then it's complete silence for six hours
and then just in the evening as i'm going home you guys start chatting in the afternoon and then
when i'm on the train when i can talk your guys everybody seems to go to lunch
yeah so it's uh completely bad timing just the time zone in it and as i've said before you're
still more and welcome to come yeah if i know that six months ago there might be some chance of
getting a flight but i i would have a lot of problems trying to explain dropping through grand
on the flight for again 300 you know spend them 300 quid to get to the UK is uh it's something
my wife tolerates for a happy husband for the year for uh for all camp like for last would be
would be tough although if if the if it becomes a regular thing you know i could maybe keep an eye out
for some sort of deals for that weekend not this year obviously but yeah well you know you still
have time to work your way over on a tramp stammer yeah i do uh uh i'm air money and put food
material for the family anyway that is is for events there are 32 shells in the cube but don't
think that that's uh happy days because quite a lot of them are reserved for over the summer um just
in the discussion what what tends to happen is it's yes feast and famine but during the summer we
tend not to get any shells involved and it is uh who goes plan to go gardening during the summer
and not do anything for each other but this will allow us to um you know put at least a show or two
up there's a month out we have what i think is a more important number is the number of posts that
we have in the cube which to me kind of signals how healthy we are as a uh as a bunch of contributors
because we have lots of people who listen and um you know if if in the morning everybody who listens
decided to record the show and send it in you know then we definitely would need to be opening up
more cues because uh the ratio we're only about like even one percent of the people who listen to
us actually have ever submitted the show you know not just not talking about one show but uh
these are regular people who download every day and we're we only have about one percent where we
look at that so that i think is that does anything good anything else to add
no i i i think about time to call it a kpco because we've gone over two hours
and it can't be a kpco because i use bad numbers so it has to be a dev run then it can't be a
dev random because of the show notes and they were in u t f a so that's not possible
now the show notes are there on the forum in fact i didn't know about till krayon uh
point him out but he he's actually been doing some rather meticulous show notes even on the topics
we didn't cover yeah but we don't even like nobody has a clue where the dev run on website is
there's about 15 different websites pointing to different locations uh they've been consolidated
all roads lead to devrandomshow.org sure that he i don't know i've stopped listening to that show
it's official right then all of us is left for me to say is tune in tomorrow for another exciting
