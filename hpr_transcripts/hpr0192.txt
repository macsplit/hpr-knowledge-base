Hi, you're listening to Hacker Public Radio.
This is 330, but this is not copy-fight.
What I want to do today is I want to talk to you guys about a really cool idea I had.
I was watching the stupid Microsoft I'm a PC ad where they start off making fun of
the Mac ad and then they talk about how there are a billion or so PCs out there in the
world.
I start thinking people are doing some really really really cool stuff with Linux and
I think that we could really kind of whip together more than just a commercial but like an
entire grass roots movement.
What I think we should do is everyone get to you know record a short clip of you saying
I'm a Linux user and I something you know like me to be like I'm a Linux user and I
podcast or I'm a Linux user and I'm a student or I'm a Linux user and I have a beard or
I'm a Linux user I have glasses something like that and make as many of them as you
can possibly think of and post them online you know YouTube, Vimeo, Viddler, Rever, all
those things and if you put them under a license that can be shared you know either public domain
or a creative commons license or something so everyone specifically knows that they can
use it.
What we could end up doing then is taking all of these videos and cutting our own commercials.
So video podcasters could have you know a quick you know let's pause for a quick commercial
from the Linux community and what this could really do is if we can get like the people
that are doing the really really really awesome stuff like they're running KDE at the Large
Hadron Collider you know how about you know some guy in a lab coat that turns around
and goes I'm a Linux user and I run the Large Hadron Collider or I'm a Linux user and
I create small black holes or I'm a Linux user and I crash subatomic particles together
you know or someone like Chris DeBona you're standing in the middle of the vast Google server
farm you know it's trying to scream over the worrying you know I'm a Linux user and I
work at Google it's something like that just you know we're all doing really cool stuff
with Linux we should let everyone know and seriously post these things up and if you
do post a link in the comments to this or email me 3 at 330.us I'll put that email in
the show notes get a hold of people let everyone know that you're doing this blog about
it Twitter, Identica all of it let everyone know what you're doing and maybe we can you
know really get a grassroots grassroots movement going that's really all I have to say
about it you've been listening to hacker public radio and I'm a Linux user thank you for listening to
hacker public radio hpr sponsored by caro.net so head on over to see aro.nc for all of us in
