This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4,501 for Monday 3 November 2025.
Today's show is entitled, HBR Community News for October 2025.
It is part of a series HBR Community News.
It is hosted by HBR volunteers and is about 50 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is…
HBR volunteers talk about shows released and comments posted in October 2025.
Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
Today is episode 4,501 for…
Um… Monday 3 November 2025.
This is the Community News where we discuss the ins and outs of what's been going on on the HBR project for the last month.
The last month was of course October 2025.
This is a volunteer podcast where the shows are submitted by people very much like you, in fact.
So if you have been listening to Hacker Public Radio and have not yet introduced yourself to the room, feel free to do that.
It's a nice thing to do and it gets your first show onto your belt and at least it introduces you to the community in general.
You can start your show by saying hello, my name is and your name and I got into tech back in then and here's my journey and here's HBR.
That's the only thing we'd like you to do.
One show a year will be great for people and this is the Community News where we talk about stuff that's been going on in the community.
And there's been a lot this month.
Um… Kevin and some guy in the internet have conflicting plans with this episode so we asked to see if there was anyone available, retail was available and volunteered.
But we're having connectivity issues at the moment so he's had to bow out but thank you very much to him for volunteering.
We normally record this show if you have listened to all the HBR episodes in a month or most of them.
You can help us out by recording this show from time to time.
I will be sending an email out more informally email asking if people want to join rather than specifically given time.
The time we normally record this is on Friday afternoon, the UTC is around 5 o'clock UTC on the Friday before the Monday.
That gives us the weekend in order to process this episode and get it up to the internet archive and out to the CDN.
So the first thing we will normally do with this is we introduce new hosts, hosts, easy for me to say.
And if I get your name wrong it's not intentional. I suffer from dyslexia and my pronunciation is not good at the best of times so apologies.
But I will guarantee you I will be equally bad at pronouncing everybody's names so I'll do my best.
First is Kubotika and Teebo and Candy Canater and that is three fantastic people who have volunteered their time to contribute.
So what we like to do is go through each of the episodes and basically give a quick rundown of what we thought of the episodes as your hosts.
But also we will read out some most of the comments usually, all the comments usually that are sent in by our contributors.
So a great way that you can give some feedback is by commenting on the episodes just it is the currency by which we pay our hosts.
And somebody who's due a big bill is Ahuga who has sent in another one from the reserve queue this time just confirm that.
And what that means is when there are not enough shows in the regular queue what we do is we take one from the reserve queue and put that in.
So that gives you an opportunity to realize that yeah this project has gone away if we don't have shows it's not venture capital funded.
It's done by volunteers and it's done on the understanding we will continue to provide services for us somehow.
So long as people are interested in keeping the project going and that means submitting shows.
But all that said this was a continued look into the brain of Ahuga and he's going alphabetically so we got Galicia games, geography, some health stuff, history, hobiltel, scope etc etc.
So anonymous 27 says excellent recommendations I love history so thanks for the recommendations you remind me of my Uncle Benny and Santa Claus a nice deep voice.
Oh he's just ducks Santa Claus Santa Claus is Uncle Benny apparently now clicking on the next button we have who is the Algoron for whom are the flowers.
And this was an episode by Antoine and it was about a science fiction story that he had read and basically discusses the impact of the science fiction episode.
I really enjoyed this and it reminded me of a lot of other shows, other pieces of work and contemporary culture that has been based following the same sort of plot line as as described in this episode.
Tray says very interesting I remember hearing the title flowers of Algoron thank you for sharing about the story here.
I will be checking out a copy from my local library soon to which anonymous 27 replies required Futurama list references.
Also the Futurama episode parasites list has a similar concept but ala Futurama style so go fry exclamation mark.
The following day we had Arthur C. Clarke becomes successful and this was biohook as well and you notice that
a hooker is very good about adhering to the rule of keeping his episodes two weeks apart but obviously that doesn't apply for when we have
shows coming in from the reserved clue queue that's done based on our discretion as janitors but usually following the rule first in first out.
And this had a comment from Arthur 72 so this is he provides links to artsy Clarke two novels that help cementous place in the science fiction world childhoods end and the fall of moon dust.
Arthur 72 says great show may the force be with you not sure he read the right book there a hooker says hi a hooker great show as usual with nice explanations of the science involved no use of the force look
but again no jokes like hey dartvither nice suit must to cost your alarm and the leg brooch smiley face
Arthur 74. The Arthur 72 Kevin O'Brien replies thank you and glad you liked it I am working on more shows about science fiction and fantasy
which I hope you will also enjoy and that is good news as well it will help fill out the queue then we had
HBR 4481 which was the community news for September 20 25 and obviously we said nothing controversial in that show because nobody posted a comment
I'm a little sad on the inside then the following day we had Jezra who has written a due to application due to four the double doose
that don't is done but as we all know it isn't crazy he's just written a command line app to interface with it I saw on the interwebs
and this is a to do application on the web that you can host yourself a source code links in the show notes
the following day we had beer garden three which was porters and this is where a kevy and dave
sampled two beers one was a Victorian porter by eight sale brewery and the other was a marmalade porter by
world top brewery archer 72 says history of beers I'm not a beer drinker
but this was an interesting history lesson in how the porters were made by archer 72
I enjoyed listening to this myself I was in the middle of doing some home renovations for my daughters
new house and I was catching up with this nice show lads troller coaster sent in a show about EU chat
control when your dentist uses chat control logic premise being he's going to the dentist and he
applies the same logic as chat control wood short a sort of play troller coaster says voting
has been delayed stop press the decision on hashtag chat control has been removed from the agenda
administers of homophares next week and this was 25th of the 10th zero nine it's safe to assume that
the fine will be read this is a later so don't stop keeping an eye on the issue if you would like
to share the open letter with a bunch of smart people than me share this open letter and references
a link to csa dash scientist dash open letter dash org for sash september 20 25 numerals with the
s uppercase link in the show notes just heard today that Denmark has withdrawn that proposal so
that is now officially off the table however no harm to keep on our guard it's only a matter of
time before that is pushed in again candy canator 07 says satire as a tool i really liked this little
story both senses pretty funny and it highlights the absurdity of the whole thing i think putting
all this in a different context that isn't beyond most people is a really good tool to point out
just how stupid all of this is we all know not everybody isn't as tech literators
and it infuriates me sometimes seeing what has been taken advantage of troller goes to replies
to that what are you talking about i just went to my dentist and wanted to share a story because i
was so happy about how to handle my teeth reached out in private and i'll happily share his
contact information warning though he's not cheap and and that's obviously also a testimonial
to how great he is operator says low yeah black moral mirror asterisk asterisk is real i only hope
ag type is just that i don't even know what our children should be learning in school life skills
but what if we have know how much change a g i or even a i will change troller coaster says
in response oh wow i sure love a black mirror for home too that sounds cool and your kids for sure
they should become dentist don't you think what is this a g i kind of whole you're talking about
is this an alternative galaxy immigration movement that i've been hearing a lot about it seems
is we'll blow away the all immigration somewhere in the future and of silliness let's move on to
archer 72 dealing with g pg and ssh keys for git in this episode he gets a crash course on how to set up
uh not in git itself but how to use it on git hub and git lab he includes full lists and ssh
full list of the code and configurations in the show notes can you can add or say zero seven useful
information i've seen a lot of people getting confused by git when they do software stuff but i
think you did a good job explaining how the software works in an understandable way archer respond
uh no say a key some response the content of archer 72 thanks for the episode on g pg ssh key
configuration it could help many people to get a clean picture of each configuration putting them
side by side as archer 72 did so thumbs up there for that episode archer well done the following day
we had a code of my mind by lee lee touches on a few aspects of coding as an occupation and ponders
neuro divergence don't we all and in part one he talks about uh capture the flag stills databases
test frameworks generative i've coding in hardware and about neurodivergence in academia and
accommodation remote working career paths etc so i personally got a lot from this episode a lot of
food for thought in there and today says excellence perspectives thanks for sharing as i continue to
fight with gooey development for our grino projects your podcast resonates the following day and
twan says is ai autistic and his motivation is characteristic second car he has several five
characteristics that would support this and it was an interesting episode and uh but i think the
danger is me speaking personally the danger here would be that you would conflate ai to be intelligent
when in fact it's not it's just a predictive statistic so if it's autistic it's learning model came
from a body of work where the people producing that may have been autistic so food for thought though
i like the show keep them coming no comments on that alas cheap yellow displays by tray part
dear what's the problem and this one was um he has some cheap yellow displays and has done
he he wants to build a more schooled tuner uh to learn more code so this is uh as a cheap
Arduino like display that's got wi-fi and you can use it for controlling so there's more of those
in this series unfortunately nobody left a comment on that one but we do have a lot of comments
on the next one and this was hax poetic pilot episode and this was by kerbottica and there were four
different poems four what a waste each of these could have been their own show and that indeed was
my comment four ways great show i hope it extends to a series each of these poems deserved his own
show i found myself re-listing and pausing to have time to come to play the meaning of each of them
keep it coming i really did enjoy this there were if you haven't listened to any of the episodes
this is one that you really would be denying yourself if you didn't go and have a listen to
tray says talk provoking welcome thank you for sharing these talk provoking poems which i
continue to ponder i look forward to your future submissions Claudio says a refreshing HPR
episode thanks for this episode really enjoyed it for someone who is somewhat burned out by
technology it was refreshing to hear your tech influence poetry looking forward to hear more
Alexandra says just through my iPhone in the ocean
thank you for sharing these poems very meaningful and meditative grace pilot looking forward
to a great show Kevin O'Brien says i love the show i really enjoy the show i hope i hear more
tray says when nostalgia when nostalgia meets the digital age this episode was a such a beautiful
trip down memory lane your poetry captured that strange feeling of nostalgia in a tech-driven world
perfectly both groundbreaking and talk provoking Brian and Ohio last comment but i do want to say
something else Brian and Ohio says don't burn out i love this show the poem about getting the
fiber of the vacation spot was well done i hope that kerbottica doesn't do too many at first and
then run out of steam that being said looking forward to the next show and i think somebody commented
about the show on mastodon basically saying this was the return to the ethos of HPR
and i couldn't agree more there were some things in this that there was too and for all with
kerbottica just about the posting of them and that and that everything got sorted out in the end so
that was great thank you very much for working with us on that and look forward to hearing a lot
more as you can see a lot of popularity so a big bulwus all around there well done civilization
part four no civilization v part so civilization five part four by uh hookah and at this point i
would like you to pause and in your mind hear the discussion that scottie and kevi would be doing
at this point thank you very much the topics were of faith and religion the next day we had an
episode co-hosted by tibo and myself um where we interviewed david levoi who is the author of
peppering cart it was absolutely a thrill to have the opportunity to interview been a big fan of his
art for years and i've also been thoroughly impressed with his outlook on creative commons free
software a lot of the work that we're doing here in hgore mirrors what they're doing on that project
and there was a lot of stuff that we discovered during the episode about things that david
debit has been doing over the last few years so if you haven't had an opportunity to i would
suggest you listen to that episode it's uh i was very privileged to be able to have that discussion
brine and ahio says great show i enjoyed this show immensely and hemerich hemerich hemerin says
inspiring good interview and inspiring listen to how he uses open source tools in particular
crater in his daily work and how he releases under a creative commons license
ron sent in an episode the following day how to just how to do a distribution upgrade of a one
two lts on a digital ocean droplet and he ran into some issues with that and he has added the
information that you need into the show notes no comments on that one i imagine until people find
it and are extremely happy with having that knowledge the next episode was another one in the
beer garden series episode four vice beer and i like the discussion of the history and history
of beers and the beers that they are reviewing there's been some comments on this one for kisses
herfervicin is best smiley face coming from the northeastern part of germany from the beginning
that means the former gdr i believe i hated beers because we only had pilsner and largar styled
and they all aren't in my taste in my way just disgusting and repulsively bitter but then after
the reunification someone from the southern part of in germany introduced me to heffa visor
and wow beer can taste good our liquor is good but when you sometimes get the chance you should
try scoff of her halfen shorter baker or the dark variant of fran's it's crater and don't believe
me they all come from the graveyard two of those are named aren't from the home of a toberfest
pol jays says great episode thanks gents great show some comments fran's crater is definitely a
herfervicie beer did you chill them they should be drunk from the fridge or in draft where they
are served chilled great for summer evening in the beer garden in karten in my opinion all
german vice beers of this type are heffa visors now pronounced at about four different ways but
we will continue based on my experience in germany my wife is germany comes from south if you ask
for a visor beer you will get a helle steff visor beer often you will get beer from a local brewery
and not from the big brewers that beer doesn't make it to the UK sadly there are actually three types
of heffa visor dunkel dark helle's light what you have both drunk and crystal which is a helle steff
and vasen with the yeast and wheat proteins filtered out often drunk with a slice of lemon on top
i agree with your comment about not fixing it i have had many great evenings tasting these as a
beer session look forward to the next episode Claudio great episode i can relate to thoroughly
enjoyed this episode because i'm familiar with funds is planner and erdinger beers we have stores
here in mayami florida called total wine which carries a variety of alcoholic drinks as well as
none alcoholic beverages used in cocktails total wine is my place to go for getting german beers like
franzi canner and erdinger as well as varshtiner beers to me varshtiner seems to be the most
mass produced beer and the first one i've ever tried of the german beers as it's the only one i've
found in one of the supermarkets here usually the pilsner total wine will carry a variety pack of
varshtiner that includes the pilsner the drunkel and the browers gold all of which are pretty good
however i find the erdinger and the franz is crannier to taste much better and you both
knelted on the head with the franzer crannier i've only had erdinger dunkel because i do like dark
beers and i find it to be my favorite of the two very eager to try this erdinger you reviewed so
i'll be paying total wine and visit soon by the way i also chuckled when you poured the erdinger
and described it just from the sound i knew what you were getting chananam says three billion
here oh sorry scotish bavarian ipw three years ago i tasted a fine bottle of broodog scotland
and vibe and stafan bavaria indian pale varshtiner that was a real taste bomb
with beer sweetness with hoppy bitterness perfect collaboration well there you go our
beer garden seems to be quite popular following the day we had untwarned again with the
futo keyboard and this was a little bit of apta splunking we're looking through windigos
series on getting some applications and giving them a test run kick in the tires and this was
changing the keyboard on your android form a good idea to do from time to time particularly useful
if you are going multi lingual following the day we had task warrior and it was by can't
cannoter and introduction to task warrior it to do tool i think in relation to
jesra's do do tool and arch this is first episode hoping to hear more regular
contributor to the comment section and archers of judo says first show good explanation hi thank
you for a clear explanation of the use of task warrior and it will be interesting to hear about more
tools you use every day strowfafel this was a show by lee where elsebeth and myself went around
uthracked basically an old chat session and there is a commenton on this but it's not in this
episode as yet for hashtag reasons this was a fantastic opportunity to meet lee and
elsebeth and have a chat walk around town basically spend the afternoon chilling talking tech
and looking around the country so lee produced his recording and he should be uploaded i have
created a very special type of monsters we've just wanted to record everything is is actually
fantastic so if you enjoyed the show yeah if you're ever in the Netherlands and you're a hp
contributor host give me a shout out so we'll see if we can meet up for a chat and if you're
amazing over the other hp other folks whack out the recorder and have a chat and youtube can have
a show following day we had fixin fixing three two is e4th and if we're talking about fourth we
must be talking about brine you know hyal who is a massive fourth fan and has given us a quick look
down through the review of the book of Arduino control fourth by dr sheng ten hansong
thing lots of links into the show notes very good episode if you're into that sort of thing
and why wouldn't you be the next episode was by al a podcast mini series where he's going to use
linux as his daily driver looking forward to it and dual boot diaries is linked in the show notes
don't be anybody switch into linux don't be disappointed if you switch over and back and switch
over and back that happens eventually you will be guided to a comfortable environment where you're
very very comfortable working and reluctant reluctant to leave or if you do you're drawn back
the following day we had an episode where unfortunately i had to reject and first
grounds on the grounds that it was published elsewhere but as was released under creator comms license
i was able to post this as a sample episode as i believed that we would be interested in hearing
about the libre form project as supported by the free software foundation and this was a nice
episode to basically round out that they are trying to liberate the non free binary blobs from
mobile phones and the idea is that as they tackle say the bluetooth stack or the usb stack then
that can be contributed back to other people who have different oss so galaxy os or whatever
so that over time the support for these devices will improve and finally today's episode
at the time of recording Halloween we have Arthur C. Clark 2001 and the sequels the best known
of the science fiction uh Arthur C. Clark series by uh Huka and Archer 72 says deep dive hi
uh Huka what a great deep dive into the book series i had no idea about anything following
2001 thanks so that there i believe is all the episodes for this month and there have been
some other commons and preview shows so the first one that we'll take a look at is
uh an episode that was released on the 30th of last month by some guy on the internet
where he said snaps are better than flat packs actually it wasn't it was it was a year ago exactly
and BA says not a fan of any of them hi Scotty personally i'm not a fan of any of these
universal formats back in the day slackware had tgz devian had devs and red hat europeans then people
said that's too complicated a game designers are never going to put up with that so each of them
started with their own universal package format so here we are years later again three package
formats Ubuntu has snaps red hat has flat pack and whoever did app image but now we still have
three universal format package formats so how are things better off you remember the old scene
saying the own the good thing about standard is there are so many of them to choose from the next one
was a comment um on bennie show ipv6 for Luddites and it was from bennie himself a link to the
previously mentioned talk on bstkan 2025 hi all here are some of the requested links for the
recording of the talk from bstkan about setting up open bst router on a ipv6 only metric here's
the link to the correct time in the video sorry couldn't find any other source than youtube and
the link is there in the show notes on these episodes hpr is 20 years old today uh steve barons
says lipetit facility which i guess is happy birthday in french congratulations to the community and
the team it was a great to audibly glimpse some of the historical netherness on ursha minors show
hacker poetry 0-1 candy canata says love it the first episode of hacker poetry 0-1 in which three
poems by anonymous hacker are read by ursha minor that was the show candy canata says love it i
really liked the idea the whole thing of having top revolving poems is pretty cool despite the
length being kind of short also is the league of better villains a real thing i don't know it should
be i thought that for anything myself fred black had to show the true audiophile of walking
tune towards a friend by fred black and fred brine in ohio asked the question why are freds bad
because in the episode um fred mentioned the fact that freds were evil why are freds bad i don't play
instruments what's wrong with freds forky said freds brine in ohio can you please elaborate
and i will elaborate forky in the episode you said freds are horrible can you explain what's
wrong with freds so across communications there this is like a playing chess by post if you put in
the comment to an episode then i read it out and then the next month i'll read the other person's
response trollocosteurs episode does a i cause brain damage some of which we as Stella says
that it was a wonderful episode thank you trollocosteur for an insightful and genuinely
funny yet bittersweet episode whether or not the audience loves or hates the eye you cover the
MIT research paper objectively and in a way that made laugh out loud more than once thanks again
and this was just by the way a quick glance summary of an MIT experiment that trollocosteur did
lots of references very well documented should go read the show notes and trollocosteur
reply saying hey is in a stalo i'm afraid i won't be able to submit any more podcasts to hpr
if i want a career to end at a high point so much flattery is dangerous glad you enjoy the
episode oh don't worry my inner troll is too strong before you know it i'll be spitting sitting
on my next soap top episode haven't decided who i'll insult in that one two there were four
comments to jesra's do do three a juice plus one and the first was by candy canater and it was
cool app bot the app seems incredibly cool but i'm still likely going to stick with task warrior
best to look with the development though and thank you very much for sending in the episode on task
warrior exactly what you should be doing well done however can you also send in an introduction
to tech how you get in so we can start bugging you for other shows just to buy the bike
archer 72 says cool app hey candy canator what is task warrior i know enough to google us but
i would be great to hear your show about this maybe another show comparing and contrasting the two
see what archer 72 did there he is a pro he is a pro and candy canator replies it's a really
nice simple command line app i've been using for a while are you able to make a one-off show like
that i don't think i'd have the material to make a lot of shows well you proved you were and if
you do an introductory episode telling us how you get into tech then we'll be able to come up with
a lot more ideas of shows that you could contribute to the community and the last comment on this
episode was from Ahmad i used to do man does task warrior support caldav i used to do man
is this a caldav based to do manager to do a read from individual ics files from a configure
directory this matches the v dur specification and he links to to do man read the docs.io and
as part of the project pi m utils.org v dur sinker can be used to sink your caldav server such as
next cloud well well Ahmad could you record us as if you'd show there about that that would be
absolutely awesome and while you're at it could you record your introductory show halai everybody
knows the standard format now hello my name is i got into tech blah i went to school blah i was
inspired by blah i used this blah and i'm now doing this blah and that's how i guess recording
and uploading a show to hpur very very simple and everybody who listens to hpur should be doing
this it's only polite so then we had all the comments from this month's show which we've done
and then we move on to the hpur mailing list discussions and i think we covered changes to the hpur
scheduling guidelines there were two other comments that came in afterwards one was saying remove line
three and ron says yes i'm fine with removing the third the third guideline the third guideline
i'm fine with this change so change from line six although i do lean towards expressing keep in
the two weeks wording i propose all those must of lead nine slots approximately two weeks between
the show i'm in agreement with the process change as well so that's good uh gym says i
think this is the best wording yet i would like to see this as a change so resume previous
suggestions which i'm ignoring because your previous suggestion was actually quite good
the point is we don't want to mention slots thinking about just because i don't want to be wasting
time explaining to new hosts about slots every two weeks everybody knows what that means it's fine
if we want to get pedantic about if we can explain this via the code the code will work on the basis of
not having nine slots before you show and not having nine slots after you show and the reason we
would do that is to make sure that you know if you're posted to show two months down the line that
you don't but that you're not conflicting there but we will get around all of that when we have
the time to do the actual coding for that then the first comment was what happened to the hpur page
i have a dark team everywhere and use my dark reader in the browser but just hpur are some working
with it now any longer and i'm feel blinded by visiting the web page i think i have to change
w3m or links somehow for this change gratings forky hot is he on about the response from
operation was it looks fine on my windows 11 and i responded going with a link to our
get t page which says user desires dark team theme from the website as issue number 275 which
had been open for a considerable amount of time robert says hi i'm a operator host id 36 the only
person still submitting show is ken host id 32 and we all know ken doesn't count so i say i'm the
oldest contributing member of hpur long live bin rev whoa which is correct long live bin rev
i would like to get in touch with some of those bin rev folks for an interview about
back in the day particularly for our upcoming five thousandth episode which is around the corner
now five thousand episode coming up would be nice to to to some of the bin rev people if you have
contacts please ask them to get in touch thank you Claudio Miranda says holy smokes i haven't
checked out the hpur website for recently it looks awesome kudos to all involved in updating it
kevin a brine says wow that's a big change but it looks great regards kevin a brine yirun says
wow the new website is a major change but it looks fantastic then the rito says
hi diligent guys brilliant thank you very much for all the efforts you put into the
refreshing the win website it is beautiful and i like the theme release a date of the first of
April would have been fun and what all of this is about is that we have we been busy concept design
and guiding light i'm reading this from the hpur generator new site contribution is empty file
apparently that's me this is ron being sarcastic or for the big one basically i put up a website
with a with a whiteboard marking and copied and pasted in some text so lee and ron have done
the majority of the work i think ron took the lead and has been doing fantastic work keeps
taking out changes they get better and better just as i was doing this just before this episode
he did an update to the um to the icon theme um on the hpur website uh which looks
absolutely fantastic they back forward and back buttons um have changed
constructive feedback and looking forward looks was done by archer 72 mark rice uh
dav morris and kut so thanks very much to everybody it looks fantastic it was a long time in the making
the um the new website uh basically it has we get a lot of feedback over the years about how we
could improve it the design is short short and sweet links at the top we've maintained a lot of
our restraints the h points still to uh points to our host page the p still points to the commons
the r stills points to the syndication um it has just got it's cleaner theme it's more adaptable
it still works in links still works in e readers uh everything just comes off the main page there's
no sub menus or anything so you go from the main page to another page and back and from there
back that's the idea they there's a brief introduction to what hpur is then we have two swim names one
is about the podcast and one is about the project and you've got an icons about recording about
our schedule subscription and listen so the entire workflow of the podcast and then underneath
you've got stuff about the project about uh uh uh so project you've got host information
series information the about page and the search options then underneath that you got two blocks
of the latest shows and the latest commons and then the latest shows themselves the pages have been
spruced up um it's a lot cleaner looking there's series uh fan the series and episode pages have
been spruced up they look fantastic and with this change a lot of the other requests that we've had
will be implemented over time so what the idea is to shrink the amount of pages that we have
down to a manageable chunk which they've done now uh we're going to take a lot of their stuff
about the about page will be just more about the project so the physical stuff about how to record a
show and practical information that's all going to be moving over to the hpur get t account
where you can check out everything related to hpur everything meaning the whole shabang
uh that and the orsync of the episodes as well speaking of which uh currently working on
uh the next um cdn node community content delivery network node which i hope to be installing next month
so that's on the way if you have a small pc with a five four five terabyte hard drive in it
that will be absolutely excellent we can sync all the media files over there and then that with
the orsyncing of the repuls that we have you have everything that you need to do in order to bring
the hpur website back up and we would love it if you did that so huge thanks to roon and all the guys
but especially roon thanks for putting up with mike planning and uh his e-fitter at one point um it has
been uh a long time coming and it just looks fantastic it's i've found myself using roon's
copy of the website in order to pulse shows and find stuff because i couldn't find it anymore on
our own website it served us well but things have moved on so that pretty much uh i think covers it
for this month's show um there are still some issues that i need to deal with uh i need to copy
the static files over uh to the new site uh and that will be and set up a process for that
happening automatically uh the generation of the site will be done uh whenever
have a cron job now that's running that's monitoring changes to the database on the hpur website
and when that happens it generates a new copy of the database and then all our tooling uh based
on that will um be fired off based on our ss feed that's generated from that so we'll have
an rss feed that are um the the the application that does the uh translation uh transcording of
the audio or of the uh transcribing of the audio to text speech to text uh that will be triggered
by that the publication of the new site will be triggered triggered by that the distribution of
the audio will be triggered by that by that the um distribution of uh regeneration of the website
when common supposed to will be driven by that so all that all that good stuff's happening
