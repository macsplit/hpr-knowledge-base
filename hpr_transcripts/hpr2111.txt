HBR Community News. It is hosted by HBR volunteers and is about 92 minutes long. The summary is
made and can discuss the last month why we need shows and the correct way to hand toilet paper.

Hi everybody my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to HBR Community News for August
2016. HBR is a community podcast network or what was that you said in your thingy
crowd sourced podcast. I like that. I like that a lot. Joining me tonight is Dave Morris.
Hi Dave. Hello everybody. Hi there. Can you welcome the new host please Dave?
Yes indeed. Just hold on a second. Failing to switch tabs appropriately. Oh yes. We have one
you host and it is Matt King USA. Indeed it is. So HBR Community News is your chance to have a look
at the video quick review of all the shows that have been posted in the last month. Any comments
there have been on the mailing list and we talk about the comments left on the previous shows.
That's pretty much it. Anything else that is new and exciting will bring up as well.
How have you been since last month Dave? Oh busy as always but yeah doing things for Hacker
Public Radio or on and off as well you know it's a few things. Things happen. It's important.
It's important especially producing shows folks because we had a bit of a scare this month again.
The upload we have a feast and famine thing going on here at HBR and over the last
month we've had a few times where we've needed to ask people to help out. Now that usually happens
over the summer in the Northern Hemisphere but I would really love it if people would
contribute shows especially if you happen to ever contribute to the show. Please do so. It's
crowdsourced. So imagine you're the only person that a log that hasn't contributed
with new feel silly if you didn't submit a show. What do you reckon Dave? I think that's absolutely
right. Couldn't argue with it. Excellent. So and if you have been contributed in 2016 now will be
an ideal time to do it. Winter clothes and in or if you're in the Southern Hemisphere hot days
forcing you to stay in your nice air conditioned rooms where you can record podcasts. So
anybody can record a show and it's really easy to do. Just go to the give shows section on the
website and all the information you could possibly ever want is right there for you.
So one of the things about HBR's we produce quite a lot of shows and I was thinking Dave of seeing
as this show is open to all the community at any time to contribute and to join. It usually
happens to be myself yourself or John or Kevin but it's open to pretty much anyone who wishes
to record. Then I would suggest that if you wanted to subscribe to just a short summary feed that
this would be the that you didn't want to or you've been overwhelmed by the number of shows coming
into the queue that you could subscribe to the HBR community news feed and then use that as your
source of what to download what might be of interest to you. What do you think about that? Well that's
not a bad idea actually not a bad idea and the the show notes that we produce for this show you
could use as a sort of launching point to go and listen to them on the website. That looks
interesting or I've heard what they said about it. I'll click on that one and listen. I'm not
so sure about doing it in a feed but that's all our theories Dave come by default with a feed
indeed they do. So it would be I think I might suggest that on the mailing list to update the
feed page talking about the community news as a jump off point to what we do here on HBR
and hopefully then people will go and subscribe to the main feed because looking the reason
everything this hop is looking at the downloads we get probably about 50% of the downloads are
drive by downloads are you know people watching the feed and then download and they shows after
the fact you're playing them directly on the website. Right okay that's interesting. I'd like to
sort of assume most people just connected a pod catcher to it and did did thing that we do.
Do I hear a car when you're a living room dude? That's my daughter who is who knows I'm recording
and has gone to another room because she's suffering from hay fever but unfortunately Clara you're
very loud. No that's fine. She's uh yeah yeah she's she's a good girl. Yeah we do the whole HBR
audience heard that Clara yeah. Don't worry about it Clara we've already heard you on HBR so we're
we're glad to hear more of it. She's off back off to university tomorrow so we're driving up to
St. Andrews take it back so turn starts next week so hopefully no more interruptions.
No worries I sent mine off to bed so uh there you go. Anyway let's dive into this HBR community news
was episode 2686 sorry I'm reading in Dutch back to front and we had one comment on that episode
and that was um Tony Hughes what's in my bag hi guys just a comment on your comment on my show
2065 the laptop I talked about were all brought at the local computer option that I've been going
to for about nine years and were most of my PC where most of my PC tech comes from so not donated
but bought at a very reasonable cost the Lenovo X61 cost me 35 pounds each and made brilliant
little netbooks and if they ever get broken you can move on and I've not lost a fortune
that is very good to know I have no idea what a computer auction is but I'm presuming
it's a computer auction do you know what they're? I don't know I've never encountered one but I assume
that just like you can go to a car auction and bid on a on a car I guess must be similar things
that do this for the computers but I don't think they have any around this part of the world but
Tony's lucky to be somewhere where they do I have never heard of them either in fact I was
down at the local recycling center during the week and I saw a lovely IBM thinkpad in the
computer waste recycling thing and I thought to myself you know I'll have that so I walked out
and the guy goes no no no no you can't have that because the computer I was just oh why not
because it's you know you're not allowed I said well you know I can wipe the hard disk and
I can take the hard disk out and he goes no no no I said but you do realize this is like a very
solid after laptop you go are you gonna you could at least give it to the recycling center and he goes
no this is what we do with laptops took it smashed it against the side of the container and
threw it in the back I was lost forwards yeah absolutely lost forwards yeah yeah it's just
probably just what his job description says so that's what he does it's sad very sad I remember that
there was a whole goal of the in the company I used to work for there was all go sun spark
servers being decommissioned you know there were top of the line at the time and there were only
two years old but there was a platform switch on the cards so the sold all the hard disks yeah
but then somebody in finance said no we have to destroy the computers because we don't want any
sensitive data been leaked and even though we sent them a the my manager his manager and the VP
of all the entire technical division tried to explain to them that that the like the data wasn't
stored on the computers that were stored on the chips not it still had to be destroyed yeah
yeah the place I worked for had a very easy going attitude to to so this really um they did
they did uh clear the the disks but but many of the machines just got sort of given away for a lot
of the time you know when when a lab was being emptied of student PCs then we just handed out
to whoever wanted them people would come along and and grab them I've got several still in my
house yeah this was exactly what happened um in this this division had got taken over by a
mother company um by you know uh officially sucked into the the parent company and there was
the parent companies rules that started getting applied so a lot of cheesed off uh engineers
who were used to getting top of the line server you know only two years old and whatever
yeah wow anyway speaking of Tony the following day we had Tony uh doing magazines I read
vegetarian times feel good food starbucks magazine and sfx magazine no none of these I knew about
no me neither me neither Tony's got an interesting collection of uh of magazines is he's reading
yeah we're we're following up I think from myself anyway and you know we heard
Tony say that he has no suggestions of shows to do really yeah Tony can you uh I was listing them
off the other day all the shows that I uh that I could do first of all how he had a career move
right in the middle of his life I'd love to hear about that uh technology the use oh yes I just
had a list but I can't possibly think of it now but there's uh we know that Tony I know
anyway that Tony's a a keen photographer and uh right there he mentions it in his magazine list
I'd love to hear more about what he what he does and uh and you know the kid he has in that type of
thing there would be a lot of photography interest I would imagine on an HBR absolutely the basics
and I never even I don't even get the fundamentals of photography the whole technical you know
the ISO things all that stuff the people talk about I would love to hear more about that
absolutely yeah yeah an introduction to to photography especially today where it's got
a lot more complicated than it used to be um yeah exactly and what your workflow is how do you
go about you know and do a do a um outdoor one just clap a sounds clip to your uh to your head
and uh off you go describing describing stuff as you go yes there's there's a there's enough potential
shows there to last for untowel years I would think and all of you Tony all of you figure even more
from our part yes indeed bless me Dave for I have sinned I have mentioned that we don't have
the ideas for sure anyways move on the next day how my wife's grandma got me into Linux um the
night wise how he got into Linux uh post very nice episode I thought yeah yeah yeah absolutely
it's quite an interesting tale of uh what happened um which I won't I won't mention because
you should listen to it to get the full benefit but it was it was really it was really quite a
a personal and interesting story I thought again I've said it before and I'll say it again
always uh these journeys are interesting where people how different people come to uh you know
come to Linux basically Tony commented hit your 2066 high night was really love the show your
experiences with Linux goes a bit further back the mind I only took the plunge winner Ubuntu
came on the scene I started to use it to free cycle all kit here in the UK I was so impressed with
the reaction of these uh receiving the freely given PCs that I started to use Linux on my own box
and have been using Linux since 19 uh 2009 first with Ubuntu and then Mint I just upgraded to
minteting and so far looks quite stable and Steve says uh great story and well told
uh night wise replies hey Steve very happy to hear you found my show entertaining I hope you
have a lot of fun using Linux I think even more fun if you have the hardware that other people
have discarded gives you Greek cred and the other Steve commented uh wish I could grasp this stuff
I hated computers and computing and growing up didn't understand the importance of
oncoming onslaught of the computer age presently 10 to 15 years hunting and pecking tried to learn
but also have low IQ so I'm pretty much locked out of any hope they're ever learning on my own
any who that's my problem this thing is I'm typing and the girlfriend and prof dad's story is
very cool thank you now the other Steve I'll be having none of that we uh you've met or
to hate we are and we will uh make sure that we uh get you up to speed as quickly as possible
absolutely so the next day was yourself Dave solving my bling stick python problem
no no no it wasn't me that was mr x oh mr oh yes of course another Scottish person for
a real Scott this time we all say all you Scottish sound people sound the same yes no it was um
yeah mr x who had um listened to your show about the bling stick yeah yes he gave me some compliments
which I'm very very happy to receive thank you very much I've said it before and I'll say it again
I'm thinking of uh of getting a bling stick and also mr x's soldering episode which I really
listened to today and now but I had space for a soldering station here in the backroom which we're
now calling the lab three raspberry pies set up on the desk with a soldering station in between a
oscilloscope and the function generator on one side hot moody one that sounds nice
oh yes image you must do a show about that Ken actually I may have to because we're run on very low
fogs um what I will do and you're back to solving the brink's bling stick problem it was a python 3
issue other yes yes it was python 3 issue it makes up between python versions that cost him
his problems yeah yeah and you replied Dave there was a yes I commented saying hi mr x an
interesting show good to know you're having fun with the bling stick I'm looking to forward to
hearing about your python project in due course so he was talking about what you was doing with
python to uh to drive the bling stick so sure that will be interesting yep I think it is kind of cool
a docker dialogue uh don't do this on Dave sorry yes uh yeah docker dialogue was um
taj with liel who is x 1 1 0 1 talking about docker where liel has the the expertise on docker
and taj was coming along as the sort of acolyte to hear hear the wisdom which which I thought was
was very interesting actually it was it's good to hear somebody who works with with such technology
on a regular basis talking about their uh their experiences and explaining it yeah very much docker
is very hot of the note i have white i didn't quite absorb i'm maybe being stupid but i didn't quite
get why i would want to use it yet but that's because presumably because i'm just me and i and i
need to be looking at it maybe more with a with a sort of um administrative you know multi multi
service type of type of i point you know b point do you ever use change route before
say what do you use um bsd jails or no change route or stuff like that well i have you see it
through on occasion yeah yeah docker is similar to that um it's funny actually this whole docker
thing because i was using um uh virtuoso way back in the day and uh at the time it was
christian side you know we as a company were being criticized for using this uh
containerization when um you know uh zen was the way to go at the time and uh now things turn
around and everything's a docker i'm it's amazing how many how many solutions now you're hearing
are being dockerized and uh yeah it's it's the solution to everything is docker
yeah yeah when when before i finished um working i uh my team was particularly involved in using
vm where everywhere so we wanted to we had lots of servers with um uh vm's hopping around between
them and uh you know being able to go to backup servers other side of the campus all this sort of
stuff and uh it uh it built tremendous amount of resilience into what we had
where um it's not clear to me how docker would step into that sort of scenario but
that's probably just due to ignorance on my part well it's more from the fact you have um you
standardize the um the the components so that you can run a minimalistic operating system um which
is supplied by the kernel on the on the main machine and it's kind of plug and play
you you can just run the minimumistic machine on there and then migrate it to somewhere else and
it's more part of uh the concept of microservices where you're spinning up multiple of them at the
same time so how fast you can create them and throw them away and create them and throw them away
but I know more shows on docker would be I this could definitely be a series as far as I'm concerned
oh absolutely I'd love to know more personally yeah okay the next day we had every day
there were a couple of comments on this one and the first one was from BEZ who said more interviews
I really enjoyed this show I don't need it make docker seem more approachable to me but I liked
hearing the different perspectives of beginner and experienced docker users I also enjoyed the
interview format and wanted to hear more of them I may have to try and make one myself good idea
times for blind tanks groovy tanks don't worry there are going to be more like this one in the future for
sure is that somebody pulling me a show Dave I think lots of people are you sure but yes yes definitely
partly the only only show if they say they're going to do a show Dave so okay okay now the next day
BEZ who had just replied there every day Linux tools for data processing give some examples of
common tools for data processing detox oh my god that is awesome that is the most awesome tool
oh my god I have changed so many scripts I have tidied up so many disks that is absolutely going
on every server I ever build in my life so you like it then I can hold on it is brilliant
oh man you have no idea I have to admit that I have since I've been using Unix and fell down
the whole of you know a file name is the thing that the parser in your shell can't necessarily deal
with so if you say you know do this thing and here are the arguments and the first one is that file
and the file's got weird stuff in it in its name like a space and like a space and of course
space being the delimitator etc etc all falls to pieces so you know I just taught myself to always
quote stuff in those in those sort of contexts yes I do as well all my scripts from the most part
well for the last few years I've been doing that because I've fallen down that world so many times
but still it is still appearing in the us it's it's true it's true the I have a bin plug-in
who's name I can't remember but it calls various syntax checkers on whatever I'm currently editing
and there's one for bash and it's called shell check and it nags you like hell every time you
save a file where you haven't covered yourself from the the dreaded spaces info names it says no
no no this one won't work so change it quote the thing yeah yeah so but yeah you know I get
files sent to me from people all over wherever and you know different oss and different countries
even and all sorts of weird characters like we we wasted a day trying to debug an issue where there
was there's a a character in one of the Eastern European languages that's got a tiny microscopic
dot next to one of the eyes and we were beating ourselves on the head why this why you know
grep awesome work and we weren't able to find it in the file we could see it there look it's
right here and then eventually we opened up a hex editor and did a hex stomp on both files and
then what code is this so yes yes yes oh yes it's a tool sir yeah yes some lovely things there
I was quite excited with with act I thought act what might it yes yeah yeah that's it's it's it's
it's a pretty pretty cool but it's a good list excellent list unique some classics there
Unix to dust to Unix curl wget said of course you've done the series on that PDF to text I
use that a awful lot so yeah awesome awesome stuff might also want to look into a PDF grep
which is actually a nice little too for greping inside the PDF files not as powerful as grep
itself but it's pretty good Jonathan Colp who also agreed act exclamation mark thanks for this
genius tool never heard of it before and you said I love detox as you already said detox minus VR
that's risk why what an excellent tool yes and Dave Morris thanks for mentioning
act wow I've never encountered act before it's amazing I've written a bunch of scripts to work with
Postgres database is yes I know it's like wearing a hair shirt self-mortification I found I could do
things like act that a shell that's page or equals more p sql space dot there's no other easy way
to do this that I know of thanks very much for pointing this out and either said interesting
I always love vim tips so I got pulled in looking at the buffer search then I noticed the other tools
mentioned most of them I know about news all that are relevant to me very frequently so now I'm
going to subscribe hi boor welcome to the team oh my show oh my show but they don't oh my show
unless they say they're going to do a show but excellent excellent excellent tools well done
my new love swift 110 has a new laptop yes I was just trying to remember what it was yes
I've forgotten what it was it got it seemed to have quite a bargain anyway yeah exactly a t420
and you went to lots of upgrades and stuff new ram and stuff so excellent nice nice when you
you know something works out yeah it should get a really good deal as well yeah it sounded
excellent unlike my roof Dave oh dear yes yes sad tale happy tale a new health this is one of yours
is this the same time I mess very briefly as a fostering that I indeed so yes yes so pity I
didn't have more time to be social I thought it'd have been nice he keeps telling me he's going to
do a show at some point but on his own but he's a busy guy so I don't have to give him but he's
got lots of fascinating things he could tell us about if I can ever get him to do it yeah keep
yeah keep shoving the microphone in front of him brilliant show notes as always Dave thanks
yeah thank you that was partly the contributions from Tom and you and went into that
yeah you should also mention you and did a nice job there on that wow looks looks pretty sexy that
that whole Raspberry Pi setup yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's really quick but it's not a cluster
as such it's just you know pilot machines that it's proximity deal yes yeah tower of pi it's still a
brilliant brilliant setup so hopefully yeah I'll get an update from him about his project and I next
see wow maybe we can do it follow through or something like that I don't know somebody should
pause this on to um on to what do you got net hacker or something yeah if you want to hack a day
somebody should pause that oh yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's an interesting thing I think uh
you and was hoping you could use the show as part of his CV because he has his degree and gone
off looking for jobs that's absolutely good luck to you yeah you're listening you and good luck
yeah it was one comment and it was from Clinton Roy who said very interesting and important
thanks for the interview and he's right it is important stuff it is it is indeed you know yeah it
takes it I used to work in a medical device company and it was very fulfilling even though my
part was kind of minimalistic yeah I know how that it has a tremendous amount of potential for
improving you know the way that the medical setups are run all over the world you know if it
can be accepted so let's hope that happens cool stuff cool stuff the following day helping to save
the world Jonathan Culpa with an accessibility series on costume keystrokes for desk time navigation
on norm oh I leave it bring me a cup of tea okay thank you yes yes like a you like a you
indeed I am in more ways than one I can tell you that for nothing and to make my own tea
you poor poor thing get your get your daughter in she's packing for university yeah always an excuse
what do I do to start wrapping her sandwiches in the in the map in the atlas
anyway costume keystrokes this is always interesting every time I see this WMCTRL thing I keep
thinking I can I can do stuff for that yeah yeah you're right I feel the same thing but yeah but
do you know the way it is actually Dave at the minute our house is such a mess we've spent the
last week going from top to bottom because it's this brilliant open scene in Malcolm in the middle
one of them where he comes in and he flicks the lights which I've told you about this before
and the bulb doesn't go on and then he goes to get a bulb and the drawer falls off and continues off
and then he ends up you know under the car and the wife comes to tell him hey the light bulbs gone in
the kitchen and he replies what do you think I'm to fix it that's the way my house has been
every job that I have had to do I can't do it because there's something else in the way and I
can't do that because the gearages are the shedges fall and the shedges fall I need to empty the
shed so I spent the whole week myself and my wife spent the whole week just clearing the house down
we're warning everything's in the front room and now the old back room is sorted so hopefully
plans to are short I might be able to get to some of this stuff in the fullness of time yes yes
I know this is always a painful process you end up living in in a corner of your house in order
to improve another part of it yeah exactly fun yeah so you replied do you want to read your
I am yes I okay yeah I come into seeing the part of Dave Morris just did Morris it's hard it's hard
job but I'll try um using Grep in a script I said one thing I learned more Scottish accent
using Grep in a script Jimmy um one thing I have learned while writing bass
scripts was that did that convince you though yeah I think in the 1950s Hollywood movie of Scotland
Erichort right up there oh sure we got it you have to do these things right anyway I said one
thing I've learned while writing bass scripts for the hell of it sometimes is that Grep
minus Q is useful for direct use in if expressions so you could do if WMCTRL minus L
like to Grep minus Q Libre Office 70 colon then and I won't read the rest of that but you could
you could replace quite a lot of what John was doing there I just the one if it can reduce script
complexity a fair bit John culper plays good tip ah very nice tip could it could serve us
having to read direct stuff to Debonal wouldn't as a question mark to which you replied
Grep minus Q yes Grep minus Q simply returns a zero which means true result if a match is found
and writes nothing on standard output I didn't know about this until relatively recently the original
Unix Grep I and Canada didn't have this and you'd have to do the things the the way you did in
your script could do Grep was enhanced with many features which I think was a good thing personally
others prefer the old clean way I like that's Grep-Q thing because I've ended up I've ended up
doing the piping dash C piping to word count dash L when I want to do this exact thing
because you can't know if if Grep returned value or not so what most of my scripts do which
involves using Grep I Grep dash C and if it's got no entries it'll be zero so pipe to word count
dash L and then if that's escaped thing equals zero then which is very round what way of doing it
I will be replacing it with this tip so nice tip tip oh thanks yep so yes it's nice it's all
about sharing things you find isn't it is it is indeed it is and sharing things that you've attended
SSL certificate's how they work never get tired of hearing this man speak I wish I had a log
that I could go to it will be cool but there you go yeah yeah it's um I have I have one there's one
in Edinburgh I've never been to I've commented on the mailing list on occasion yeah okay but
I'm talking more all you need to do is say guys I don't have a beard because I've got this skin
condition I'm probably old enough yeah anyway I replied it's not allowed in the excellent episode
as always I'm not a lawyer but in the EU at least it's not permissible to intercept all communications
local SSL serve even if there is a policy in place about not non-personal use of computers
Google Chrome has also implemented checks that will alert if the site of non-serts for example
google.com turns out to be not using the ones for google.com and he mentions that in part two
yes yes I haven't heard of the google thing the crumb thing I mean it's just detecting man in the
middle stop is not yeah it's baked into the browser itself and it will verify with google certain
well-known websites like Gmail and Microsoft and places like that that's how a lot of those have
been found actually a lot of those exploits but Kevin mentioned that in the next episode
he him Kevin replies to you saying different in the EU well I'm not a lawyer either but it looks
like EU and US different in this regard I can say that in US the courts have ruled that it's
legal since the company owns the computers yep but wouldn't be for if you brought your own
personal phone or something like that yeah yeah okay useful bash functions bar two this time
for the development of bash functions that may be of use in your script see how I'm cheering
up Dave this is your bash scripting other useful functions can you go back to the yes null function
did you get a slagging over this did the well somebody said to me oh that's not very good because
it if you gave it a default it offered it to you on the command line so yeah so that you had to
then delete it before you could talk the other things that you wanted to type and somebody pointed
out that that was that was horrible and I think it might have been somebody quite close by now
it was me you sure yeah whatever when maybe it was just me me telling myself I didn't like it
but I thought I'd just rework it so I could get get a shot at that I thought I had a question
did I post it on the comment you did I had a question here's me with the questions
any particular significance of the percent s I did not know this about the function name
array no nor did I know about the bash line number array nor about the default two power power
thing why do you do this prompt the prompt dollar prompt yn and not simply prompt yn with a within
the comments it's it's it's quite a long answer um so so the I said the percent s is to be used
in the prompt and then gave an example I do want to continue percent s yes but could it be
percent cow for instance a present banana does not because because it's a substitution point
for print f and so it's saying here I want to put the thing that you compute for me the brackets yes
no with the capitalization appropriate to my default I want it here so you could not not have it
at all if you wished it's like the percent d when you're doing the percent s yes okay
put the string here so substitute a string of arbitrary length as I said in the reply such a
budget yeah and the use of print f to write the prompt string allows format to be defined when
you call the function and it's and that's that's all that stuff about print minus v prompt
the minus v prompt saves the result in a variable called prompt and it rewrites the the existing
variable prompt and the dollar prompt variable was the thing with the percent in it so it just
rewrites it without the percent s but with the the yn business in it yeah I would probably have
don't command substitution in there yeah it needs it needs the print f in order to do the
substitution yeah substituting a string into a string yeah yeah you could have done it through
through putting the string you're going to substitute in into a variable and then dropping that
into the the string yeah you could do that but I thought this this was more elegant no print f
print f I've avoided for some strange reason don't know why I felt too see to me oh yeah
it's why I was also used to parole as well oh absolutely yeah all over the place it's yeah it's
and in a walk and all and all many things do you know somebody should do a sure about print f
yeah yeah well it's probably a good idea yes yes this kind of you speak to that somebody yeah exactly
this community use thing just ends up being how many shores I can get you signed up for in the
many shores you can get me signed up to do oh yeah it's a there's a certain yeah yeah there's
certain balance in that as well isn't there anyway so I think it might be best to be point people
to read this comment if they're interested enough rather than me yeah exactly going through to the
bit of end although I do think there is a print f is oft not understood command at least by
myself so would be no harm to have that as a is issue yeah yeah yeah well it will come up under
the awk heading I can guarantee that but it's of relevance in in that context and it's also come
up in bash as well as we so we've just seen so there you go cool new toys my story for my PC hardware
journey in the last 20 years and it is amazing it is absolutely amazing how much we've come on
intel to its sixes I remember them very well remember trying to get them to work and I was like
as in in college and then trying to get IBM PCs to work and work and right now we have like the power
of raspberry pies just it's amazing what those raspberry pie threes can get up to yeah true true
get to have things have moved in very interesting directions Tony left a comment on his own
to say that he made a mistake the price of the new shower during the show mixing mixing it up with
the dell laptop I also bought the same option the total price he paid was 184 pounds 80 p which given
then go on eBay for 260 plus not including delivery I thought it was a bargain I would agree with
him Tony's definitely the man for the bargain at the auction so it's somebody to follow
that right there there's the show Tony Tony put on a sunset clip on your head on your
baseball cap and go round to the auctions feel like give us a atmospheric show you still need a
good name for those type of shows community anyone think of a good name for those type of shows
that would encompass swimming in France in her walk stone rainy lanes coal and shows from psychiatric
wards and that sort of thing that would be nice Frank there was some Frank shall I do yeah please Frank
Frank's a nice short comment Frank says I remember slide rules dot dot dot yes he
because Tony mentions that there were slide rules around when he was in in college I think it was
I when I did engineering we were the first year that didn't have to use slide rules
I always felt cheated about that so if Frank would love Frank of anybody else would like to do a
slide rule show that would be awesome I'd really like to know how those work I did actually
where we can get them and whatever they'd be hard to get these days aren't they yeah oh Dave
the betcha I guarantee you somebody is producing slide rules right now probably cheap crappy plastic
ones yeah maybe so maybe so that would be interesting probably something for your reboot civilization
reboot civilization box you know yeah yeah I am I did offer to do a slide rule show way back when
I mentioned them on one of my shows and I never did it still on on my list and I keep looking
and I'm thinking oh I'm not sure I want to do this first is anybody else that wants to be Dave
to the course please please do so yeah yeah right I did have to use it and did use them
fair bit and I was a schoolboy but yeah I never really was very good at cold and well I didn't
have a very good one that's what it was it was the rule wasn't me of course yeah yeah yeah I've
got a more expensive one it would have been much better yes yes I know the feeling um
following day minimal realistic music site Mac King discusses the availability of an open source
multimedia focused website very very simple source for just on that for such p forward slash
minimal dash music dash site that's it very responsive website for uploading content originally
designed primarily from musicians needing an easy interface to share content upload files in
the admin page automatically saves files in a directory and lists the contents with it so
be interesting to see how secure that is but I have often needed to do such a thing and also
on sites that wasn't that important how you know there were internal so it doesn't really matter
yeah it was it was an interesting thing I was wasn't quite sure what to expect when I saw the
the title yeah exactly it was an interesting first show I thought yeah the musak show was the next
lyle and Taj talk about making music on Linux x101 submitted the show tools LMMS
Adora Q tractor fluid synth hydrogen loop guitar racks and rack rack all of which can be
shows in themselves yeah yeah well I hope that lyle tells us about progress as he as he goes into
trying to make music with Linux tools like this these are yeah I'm cutting off of course
no it's he's trying to learn the ways of making making computer based music using only Linux which
is an interesting approach I think that's what he wants to do anyway so you know it's it's going
to be going to be quite an interesting thing to listen into and Taj being a musician yeah
as a you know if they do more of these interviewee type chat shows that would be very interesting
absolutely and also don't be afraid of the i fail shows and I was planning on doing some
this week because I've been trying to get a satellite usb thing working on one hand and a usb
digital audio converter thing working and I've tried you know did you ever do a project where you
tried stuff and then you tried more stuff and then you hit another roadblock and another roadblock
and another roadblock and eventually get the final goal and there is um you know you get the error
message and then you paste the error message in and it's on the website oh that's version that
hardware is not supported and will never work and blah blah blah go buy something else and you go
if I don't you know that I would have saved myself three weeks of my life is that an interesting
short or not oh I think it's interesting yes yes but absolutely what does approve because you know
the whole process have gone through it they've the how you well it shows that people do find
themselves in nasty holes like this and it can take a long time to find that they are in a hole
and maybe the person listening will will avoid that hole in the future is certainly one one
possibility um maybe push people to doing better analysis in the first instance do you think
yeah don't buy cheaper actually that that probably should be the end of it you know as a series
it will be a good good series um you know fails they you started a project and it failed and
um how you approached you know taken from another angle might be nor her I mean I learned lots of
stuff in the process but okay I'll think about it it's it's like science isn't it there's all this
talk about a lot of journals won't take the failure failures of scientific experiments and stuff
they want people want to write up I did this and didn't work and they say oh no we don't want that
we only want the successes so you never the lesson is not necessarily learned by the the next
generation of people trying to do the same thing you know that model yeah that's yeah I just saw
YouTube video on you know breaking down how dangerous that is that they there's now a move to try
and get studies funded beforehand and have them guaranteed to be published regardless of the
results yeah well that's that's a great thing that's a great thing okay maybe we should
try that that that would definitely be a fail seriously re-enable copy and paste in the browsers
how to bypass the roadblocks implemented by JavaScript oh yes what a waste of time that is it's
it was an interesting um revelation I'd been caught out by this and been intensely frustrating
and I couldn't use my um keep our sex to paste stuff in and so on I have tried to poke around with
the you know drop down into developer um thingy on the web browser and try and see what I could turn
off succeeded I probably once or twice I can't remember that me too um but uh yeah and it was
quite satisfying saying well stuff you whoever created this stupid thing and uh because I got
around it but but having plug-ins to it is far far better so yeah but it's really good again as I say
it's completely waste of time the people who are anyway technically competent can get rounded on the
other people you're just frustrated it's it's part of that mindset that is just following a rule
because somebody wrote it down and you dare not argue with them because my because of your job or
some nonsense like that I've used to fight the stupid thing about 90-day password changes
at work and I succeeded for many years to to stop that but as I when I left like the the
auditors who who stipulate these things I think managed to to institute it across the bat and um
disclaimers in emails it's a student sending a message to his supervisors saying I'm a bit stuck and
it has a disclaimer at the bottom of it what an incredibly stupid thing bloody auditors again
and this uh please don't print this email attaching a gif of a tree with or whatever
I mean just think yeah and then there's a two and four email and all of a sudden 25 megabytes of
disc space has been used up by this guy and the disc space is taking up space and energy and the
amount of packets that this thing needs to be sent around you it's going you kill and trees mate
delete your tree for bureaucracy it's for people who use a large font stave
oh yes we'll get this well put right soon don't you we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll
how are you on the tab versus space thing uh apparently it's then you will be
them versus e-mix where they use tab or spaces in text files oh right I've I've I've got
um expand tab switched on in in my them so if I type a tab it turns into spaces and
when you load a file it says oh these tabs in around just change them to spaces unless you say
I want them kept like you need to make files and stuff yeah so yeah it just makes life so much
easier I find okay your your views on that if anyone wants to record a show on why one way or the
other would be what we've done very tempted to do a show on toilet paper the correct way to hang
it up as all might just write that here on the board uh yeah fold the ends probably and I into
interesting little airplanes and stuff like that that's what you should be doing yes yes yes
they uh go they with their rolls round to the front where you can easily grab it or you can
put it at the back where all the gunky stuff can gather on the wall uh guess which one I will be
recommending I can't I know sorry I can't do it I know what's on my pod catcher tone use who
apparently can't think of anything to submit um hbr of course going Linux Linux voice Linux action
show Linux uh unplugged uh mint cast Sunday morning links review the pod podcasts which
unfortunately it's just stopped we want to podcast the BBC kitchen cabinet and from Bungie cave
this life science more amaze and in our time good shows did not get a chance to put them into an
OPML file yet so on the list though Dave yeah yeah yeah that should be I've got a pal
script that can do that I think somewhere are you are you are you taking over feel free what have I
said don't don't let me busy father with young family you retire gentleman all the little
children fleeing the nest nothing but plenty of time long winter evenings no pressure Dave
you almost encouraged me that again oh lordy anyway 2021 Ron had angular GS ng repeat and browsers
that shall not be named been named a method for optimizing and rendering items user angular
JS ng repeat directive did this go over my head yes but he was able to explain it very very well
so much so that I I realize this is the essence of hpr you you've got a lovely hack and it is a
it is a very ugly hack but it's working and you need somebody to tell about it somebody who
would appreciate it and yes this was awesome yes I agree I agree and the fact that it went also
went over my head because I'm not really a web web web web person I don't don't get it don't
really want to get it that you know there's got nothing to do with it it's it was I was still
well able to follow this like the refreshing the pages he gave enough explanations so that the
layperson could follow it absolutely awesome well done and why you would use it and amazing
that you can do this sort of stuff amazing stuff the whole web world is it's got enormously
complicated it has it has we have with java script and and all of that good stuff it's it's become
really amazing so yeah there's also dangers of it like going back to you know I simply can turn
off all this java script stuff in my browser and then it won't work because it's you just got
a bit cold running on my computer yes yes yes I I not go to many sites where I just got a blank
page nothing there go right switch java script on I yes there we don't miss and that was it's
no script plugin that allows you to select which one and then you turn on one website and there are
10 websites hmm which are these are advertising ones let me just try this one okay that did work
image dot site okay I'll turn that one on and then you just go anyway it is good show though
more more of that type of thing the following day was DIY book binding and I saw on the IRC
that plateau was going to do a show on book binding which I strongly suspect will be
or for higher color better than mine well I thought it was an interesting approach actually it's
that it was um I don't know I don't know whether I would have taken a jigsaw to it but I'm not
sure well so I would have done but because my experience with jigsaw is that they're horrible messy
devices that you hard to cut straight line with and yep the orchestra that that that's that blade
bends like hell and it's also tends not to be very fine I suppose you can get finer finer
tooth ones and I do it to a better chopper still yep it's also an interesting interesting approach
and a fact that it you actually managed to get something bound that way I thought was most intriguing
I have another one ready to rock here I need to do tomorrow it's um it's very much a thing in
the maker world to do book binding yes there's a guy I follow called Jimmy Duresto does stuff for
make there's some other things who's who's done some superb notebook things you know he binds them
and then puts them in a leather cover and stuff like this and it's it's it's a fascinating thing
to watch I don't know Clara and I did a she did most of the work but she made herself a
bound book using the sewing technique yeah it's lovely the thing you mentioned mentioned
the sewing stuff hi Clara did you hear it Clara why don't you do a show on the book binding thing
I did a show I'm tying a knot in the nearby to come on it's got to be better than that
I have to give her some headphones to get all that yes yes no she's done the one no how many
shows have you done now Clara one wasn't it you did one with me you came back from your
Indonesian trip what oh yeah yeah she'd forgotten but yes yes we'll have to get her into
making that make a new recording for her I could probably read you anyway absolutely
anyways the following day we had calf reverb by nature Jordy I thought he wasn't doing any more
of these shows but it's good to see that he's got still a few more in there wasn't aware of what a
calf reverb was until I tell the show basically yeah I yeah I couldn't have told you I know
reverb is but I don't know what this particular thing was but yeah interesting he knows his
way around this stuff it's quite quite interesting to get get more info about it I like the the
fact that you can pick the size of your room and very clear the the explanation and also seems
very clear they controlled if you go to the website that's linked nice so I haven't
followed it through I just got a cat dumped on me for for daring to bring my daughter into the
yeah so retribution was sorry yes there's an insight into the domestic arrangements you very
nice to hear Dave anyways SSL problems this is the second part of a hookah show where he addressed
the that the Google thing was on also very good links to lots of stuff here in the show notes
and did you know what I was I actually got offered a job for them really really loud I didn't
take that job in the end it would have been my head at the time embarrassing
as Drex sorry go on it's Mr X we're going to say yeah my podcast client podcast client he is using
each potter never heard about that yeah well I yeah I commented on this and to the effect that
I had used it way back in 2006 I found around about the time this this it came out around about
then at the same time as everybody was using juice I think it was windows and I tried it and I
for some reason I stopped using it is actually very good when you look at the details of it it's
it's but maybe it wasn't so good then it certainly developed quite a quite a bit over the time it's
really very clever it doesn't seem to be updated anymore a little bit of a problem no I think he's
giving up on it perhaps yeah which is a 2010 but then again maybe it's finished well indeed still
seems to work as far as I can see so what's written in Haskell you're good that's where the
heat comes from yeah yeah it's gonna be unless you're a Haskellite then you're gonna be struggling
to look after that I think yeah my pal Tom writes Haskell so I'll get him to do just after he
does all our shows yeah yeah after the canoe healthy after saving the world medically then he
can record some of his first shows and then take over ownership of that yeah I think you should
do a tutorial on Haskellite he's very very keen at being a computer scientist he's very keen on
the concept of Haskell which I find very difficult to to absorb myself but yeah anyway shall I
shall I read out my comment because I've said okay so I said I'd forgotten H Potter it's an
interesting show your description of H Potter made it sound well worth looking at then I realized
I'd heard the name before and looking my home directory found I'd used it back in 2006 I even found
the twiddleslash.h Potter directory and the old SQL SQL lite database which interestingly contained
lots of TLLTS pointers so 200 and whatever but so obviously I was listening to them those days and I
said yes my home doer contains all the collected crud of many years of tinkering yeah I just I just
up and move it to the new new machine you know yeah so I know the feeling I have no idea why
I stopped using H Potter I eventually had together a system I own around bash Potter so maybe that's
why prior to that I think I was using juice on the family windows system and at some point G Potter
anyway it was nice to hear about H Potter again good shows good shows again with a yeah whether
what's the best to use I was thinking of writing my own eventually but hmm I don't know we will
see you we will see make files for everyday use was submitted by jungle where he talks about
make files in my lini pond and html projects I had never considered that you would write a
make file to do this type of automation but it actually makes an awful lot of sense yes indeed once
you get into the concept of using make file so that type of thing there's there's many many applications
to use it though understanding it understanding make is quite a challenge I find anyway yeah so I
have heard people say over the years so there was some comments on that said this himself John
and John said that his his knowledge was was sort of put together from looking at other people's
make files to a large extent which is you know fair enough yes comment shall I do the first one
was from fweeb who entitled it dot phony I did a quick info make and scanned through it a bit he says
the dot phony target is a kind of safety net see normally targets and make files share the name
of the exact file being made however in the case of something like clean there's usually no
file with that name being produced just a series of deletions however if there is a file name
clean in the same directory as your make file this can cause some confusion for the make command
so by using dot phony clean you're telling make to disregard a file name clean if it happens to
sit I'm less sure about dot suffixes section on that in the manual is long and it starts with the
phrase old fashioned so perhaps in something it's not entirely necessary for your make file at this
point Jonathan Culperpire is not real thanks for the info it's funny I guess I could read
info man pages myself but normally I just look at other people's make files for examples and never
really understand what you're doing once it all works I'm happy bit of trial and error and more
bit of trial and more error dot dot dot I felt the urge to comment and you did copy and paste
programming I don't know I should stop this anyway we've said copy and paste programming we've
all been there I believe the practice is called copy and paste programming nowadays where you
you know copy paste from other people's stuff I've certainly written make files by this method
I've tried to learn more about the subject by reading good new make manual but it's hard going
I'd say it's certainly a subject for a series of HBR shows well done well done see what you did
there folks see what you did there so yes what we need now somebody to step up to
somebody knows make files gone yeah I know what that means yeah and that's you it's you changing
the oil of my wife's car Jonathan Culper submitted many shows this month and the reason was we didn't
have enough and why do we need to have shows every day Dave do you know that I think it might be
because if we didn't have a show on a day we wouldn't have a show on that day and but this is a
podcast tape why would it matter because there would be four other shows that week why would it
matter yes but the principle of heck of public radio is that there's a show every week day
yes there wasn't a show that there wasn't a show on a given weekday then it would have been
cheating exactly it would be letting down your audience and if you look at Annie and all of the
how to keep and grow and maintain your audience on even YouTube or NPR local radio stations cable
networks and stuff they say post regularly and keep to a schedule that is every single one of them
post regularly and keep to a schedule HBR schedule is five days a week Monday through Friday and we
haven't deviated from that for many years now and we have always said we have said as part of
me coming on board the deal what the deal was that I will continue to post the shows help people
out until somebody else steps up to the player to do it or we run out of shows of which time we will
continue to post shows every single day we will use up the emergency shows and once those are gone
then the HBR is a project will stop and that will be that and that's fine if that happens and
eventually you know when the day before entropy occurs we will be shutting down HBR going there
you go absolute four billion blah blah blah blah and thank you very much that was the last HBR show
hopefully we will do that but more than likely we'll stop prior to that but I would like HBR to go
out with the posting all the shows and then just stopping on the day so if you want HBR to continue
then you need to submit yours it's a crowd-funded thing that's it's crowdsourced so send in your
podcast doesn't have to be rocket science but it can be that's all I have to say about that
I thought often it would be nice if we had a few shows from people about how they thought about
being HBR hosts when they were listening to it or no no no I could never do that and then they
made the plunge and became host and and found that it wasn't such a big problem after all and
it changed their lives somewhat in feeling that they got beyond a barrier they thought was
insurmountable and found that it wasn't and it'd be nice to hear some personal stories about
that that type of thing it would but also nice to hear from people who thought I'd like to post
a show to HBR but I never did and here's why I didn't because that would be really useful
information for all Steve because the key to you know this project keeping this project going
is not as I've said to you it's not increasing the listenership it's increasing the number of people
who are contributing shows with that we will increase listenership by definition of the by virtue
of the fact it would get more people in and they're producing shows so if you're a HBR contributor
and you have submitted shows you also should be going around asking other people to contribute
I don't even know what the ratio of a number of people I've asked to contribute to show and who
have it's like 1% of the people that I've asked but in order to get 1% you at least have to ask 200
people so how you do that you go to festivals you go to places you hand out they HBR business cards
we really need to get more people submitting shows it's not that hard yeah you need to do that leaflet
that we had before perhaps again yeah and we need to start going back to festivals and we need to
any leave brochures in public libraries and talk to any hobbyists leave brochures in
hobby shops and stuff like that and we need people to make those brochures for us that sort of thing
think outside of the box guys anything where people gather together where you know the local
forge would be an ideal place to leave some leaflets very good yes okay anyway how we change the oil
on his wife's Honda CR-V are these falling into a garage series or not sounds like yeah yeah
it's very close to it and John's garage and get your oil changed and that neighbor has been on so
often now I think he deserves his own his own host number should have him submit a show
oh yeah yeah bad and you're listening to these sorts of things it's lovely it's like
so bearing to somebody else's life exactly it's pretty awesome do you know one of the things that
always puzzles me listening to sounds of things and John's driveway and whatever
yes how many vehicles that go past his house that sounds like they're agricultural you know
they sound like tractors and and you know combine harvesters or something like that going past
I just wonder what they are there's been a lot of bells recently as well did you hear the bells
the bells yes yes there were distant bells aren't they yeah yeah listening to the birds
I don't know maybe he just lives in like a in a phone booth somewhere and is just using
sounds from from the internet archive just to pat out the to make us all believe that he lives
in a in this nice rural area or free sounds that are okay that's what I'm thinking of
yeah you could have heard that very much how can my inner irritative you gone
gone to get a shutdown for pushing miracle cures for BPPV I was just thinking to listen
into this thinking that's one more thing now I have to look forward to in my in my upcoming years
why why yeah yeah like I said in the thing there was a there was a point where I wanted to go
into medicine and so I'm as well as being a biology geek now and pouring everybody to tears
with biological crap I also get to quite interested in medical things and do the same I'm afraid
no I was fascinating also that the fact that it never struck me before and it's obvious that
these are channels in your skull that you can't just pop it out as a unit it was
do you know I never realized that no neither did I and and it was actually researching this
that made me suddenly realize that that was the case because all the while since being at school
I mean shown you know as I suppose everybody is you you talked about the structure of your
inner ear then we show it as a as a structure that you know totally enclosed sort of tubular
structure that you could hold in your hand but you'd have to do some some chipping and hacking
away into that form you know I don't really understand presumably somebody once took a skull
and poured wax into the space to see what shape it was and took took it out and stuck it together
and whatever and said there you go that's the shape and everybody's gone with that ever since
we didn't know actually that's from this month so we've broken our own rule Dave
anyway we have yeah I normally look out for these things so we'll say the delights of
next next month yeah yeah that's it's just yeah somebody to look forward to next month
we had oh thank you very much for updating the comment system that's let's do that
Dave has broken up the comment system so that he has eight comments from four previous shows
and there are 24 comments on 12 of this month's shows so that's excellent we've already covered
the other comments so we'll go back and have a look at the comment about Gabriel even fires
old engineers and new engineers which alpha 32 commented it was an excellent show the show was
great magnet of things that was hilarious and obviously he had his kids solve a puzzle and it seems
kids always come up with sorry the comment is the magnetic thing was hilarious it seems a kid
always come up with those incredibly simple solutions very reaffirming and entertaining thanks
for sharing great shows I agree couldn't agree more next one the next one sorry I'm just coordinating
myself in I can do the other Roger HP out now I've got it 2006 was community news for June and
alpha 32 made the comment world oat domination Dave we should start a pinhead stroke steel cut oat
racket I'll ship them from the US you sell them in the UK I'm guessing their rarity in the UK
because she'd been importing them from Europe pinhead oat industry an unforeseen casualty of Brexit
very nice comment I like that mid do you want to read your own comment or
made in Scotland I said in reply alpha 32 nice idea but pinhead oat meal is produced in Scotland
by hamlins of bans Aberdeenshire I see my picture at and there's a flicker picture I pointed
I took took a picture of a tin of pinhead oat meal for for other other people to prove that it
really existed and and probably others to no doubt other than hamlin I suspect that not much
goes south of the border of this wonderful stuff and as to Brexit in my nightmares I see is
heading back the days my childhood where garlic was even evil foreign substance and olive oil
was putting on burns and kept in the medicine cabinet wow oh dear dear dear
Anyway fixing my daughter's laptop alpha 32 replied brilliant well done Mr Morris I'm
constantly breaking things so this was one was getting bookmarked so I said in reply I hope
it never happens to you thanks for the comments one thing I don't think I said was I
ensured the drill bit protruding from the drama was far enough to only far enough to get about
two millimetres from the base of the hole I visions of wrecking the laptop have accidentally
drilled into some other component if I had to do this again I drilled as far as I could then I might
try gluing a cocktail stick or thin nail into the into the hole in the plug we had to sign
I could relate to a super glue I'd use the gel toots it didn't dribble over the place to make
the problem worse though I'm not sure I would actually do that come to think of it that seems a
bit so cool yeah you'd have to be very very steady in yeah Jonathan Colp says I'm in the same
boat the exact same thing happened to my daughter's laptop about two months ago I have still not
revived the tiny bit of the headphone jack from the laptop our solution was the $10 USB adapter
I had lying around for just education when audio goes belly up on one of our computers she's
using that now and seems happy enough you replied replied to John saying thanks for the hint John
I daughter had actually survived perfectly well with the adapter on the sort you recommended to me
during the semester thanks for alerting me to these devices by the way I wanted to fix the audio
jack problem because I thought the USB device was mechanically vulnerable since it sticks out
the moderate amount my son destroyed a dual port on his laptop many years ago in an accident
involving a large USB stick so I've always regarded laptop USB ports as fragile yeah I'm inclined
to agree because once you've smashed the the structure of the USB port then it can be very hard
pressed to get it repaired or you know you and you they don't have that many and you
you live lost important access to your to your laptop yeah exactly I'm and that's a bigger problem
that but it did take a certain element of bravery in order to do what you did Dave though
and especially on your daughter's laptop make sure she was out of the eyes
yeah exactly does she even know you did this oh yeah she does yeah yeah she was quite at least
with the outcome yes yeah it's good to know that you took backups before and has I recall you
didn't but yes that's it does also brave it's nothing important the my laptop she says anyway so we
have one more comment on 282 which is shown by natural jordy basically go to production
equalization and it was from Jonas who said new perspective thanks for the show
I always tend to change the EQ settings when listening to music etc I never really thought about
it from the audio engineer's point of view specifically the idea of tuning different frequencies
out of a recording to change the feel of the recording seems like what noise cancelling headphones
do more manual imprecise EQ after the recording is done feels kind of blunt and pointless after hearing
what it's really for I guess that's why they have all those sliders when you see studios on
TV and movies I've much more respect for audio production engineers now maybe on your next show
you could talk about different ways you could record in a noisy multi-person room as compared to
a smaller room with just one or two people hmm good idea yeah I don't like the inherent
request for shows yes yes the the whole audio thing is not as obvious as you might all think
is it it's it's there's a lot of magic in there and you need to understand stuff that
it does is no and not intuitively obvious I find anyway absolutely when I was recording that
thing about GNU Health I took a mic you know recording device a zoom and I stood in the middle
of a round table and the three of a sat round the table and I thought I thought it would give us
and I set it in a mode where it did a sort of round card cardioid shape type pickup but the result
was I was very clear but but my interviewee's Tom and you and were not anywhere near as clear
you and as a bit clearer than Tom he's got a slightly louder voice I suspect but so and I
spoken to an engineer after that a friend who does quite a lot of audio work and he said oh no
that's not what you do it at all and I'd set it in the wrong mode apparently so who who would have
known or not me obviously yeah I've I've had that with the with the zoom here interviews so I just
tend to have a front facing very narrow with these zooms you have just for people who don't have them
they there's several different modes that you can set them up where it's at the back microphones
is too pointing to the back and they've got a 120 degree angle and then there's a front one that's
90 degrees so when I'm doing interviews at FOSTEM I set the front one to 90 degrees and then
pointed directly at the person's face so you pick up very little background noise for you know
given the people that are there yeah I think so you need to know your case basically is what you're
saying yeah yeah yeah you you need to understand what setting should have different environments
did you see didn't did you plug in when you were recording that interview did you plug in headphones
into the zoom to hear the output no no I didn't always do that I should have done that yeah well
not that your audio was your audio was fine I I went I had to go through it and boost
other two or everything they said got boosted manually so it was a very long process yeah
three microphones would have been better of course for them yeah I mean yeah you make do with what
you have CHPR not the BBC yeah on the August 2016 archive mailing list we had a notification
of a new podcast the you random podcast.info with links to the website mb3n.org feed as well
as the email address and x1101 who is live replied eventually we found out what his name was Dave
the mystery it's good to know yeah it's good to know and thanking us for that so please have
a listen to that it's a really good show and Kevin asked for mono to stereo thing and I don't
know why he just doesn't do that himself in post processing you know I don't necessarily agree with
stereo podcast for audio anyway I don't think it adds a lot but because I sometimes need to
listen in with one ear I always switch everything to mono in my post processing I've downloaded
yeah yeah I use audacity to convert everything to mono before it makes it easier to edit too
it doesn't it's pretty straightforward thing to do as well as truncate silence and I've
already done a show on my audio workflow you sent in a email about the end of gmail mailing list
yes yes I don't think the situation's improved I've must have been I've not followed it up much
I've seen people pointing to the fact that gmail is closing down on social media so I don't I don't
think it's improved particularly but thanks quite a lot of comments on it yeah yeah
yeah really sorry to see them go if they do and it's absolutely very much for the excellent
work that they've done in the past I always think news news as a protocol has a lot to offer
that people are not looking at it's just the thing yeah it's very much gone out of favor now
isn't it seemingly hello a lot of people read their mail through used to read them out through
using it news on on G-Main, which is something that surprised me when I was reading about it to be honest, but
Yeah, I can understand why you don't want to do that. Yeah, and then we have the inevitable call for shows that goes out every few months
Which makes me sad. Boss, there you go
So people please submit shows. Thank you very much. Don't be
Trying to do a masterpiece. It's a podcast
Just record it, send it in, just matter how long it is, just matter what the topic's about so long as there's of interest hackers, and it will be
Yep, do that. Thank you. Bye
Yep, yep, hopefully we will we did get a get a response from that which is which is quite good, but
You know, and things quite and down again, and it's gonna have to be another
plea in a couple of weeks
Yeah, unfortunately the response was mostly from you know, they old regular show hosts
Which is big concern. Yeah, yeah, that's true. It's true. They weren't I wanted to
You know, like Tony has now the old regular I guess was a yeah, you know, yeah, yeah, Mr X
Norris Beasy, Windigo, Dave, the Lovebug, John Culp, you know, the game that's it's the same old people
Coming up with the shows
So yeah, yeah
Okay, Dave anything else to add to this very depressing end to today's show
I was just searching for something positive to say but I couldn't find it. So nothing I'm afraid no, no
Let's just
Winnie moshaws it's not it's not that there are people who want to make shows
It's just that realize it getting people to realize guys record them send them in. It's quite simple
Yeah, either that are you gonna be listening to six months of shows that I produce which I don't particularly think would be that interesting for people
So we call them send them in. It's as simple as that once you're a year. That's all we need all righty
Any other news Dave?
I don't think so I don't want to choose more tweaks to things. Oh, yeah, I just I found that the
The way in which episodes are displayed on
HPR site
meant that the
The things that let you jump from show to show say first previous next latest the one at the top of the page was
inserting leading zeros in a in a number less than
For digits
Whereas the bottom one wasn't and I only discovered this because I was working in the range
900 to 999
while I was uploading some of them to
To archive dog yeah, and and I was finding hang on
Where have I got to know why is the zero dropped off the front because you need the zero one for the comment system to work
and
Which is another thing of course, but oh, yeah, so
I yeah, I corrected the
The PHP that's basically all it was so and that's now in place and seems to be working fine
And I need to put in on the front page that more next thing for five pages, you know for the next five previous five. That's what I think
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be nice. That would be nice
myself more reactive toward that
I would actually think in of putting a first previous next world maybe not
First and last, but previous and next on the archive dog versions actually. I'd be quite nice
Yeah, by the way you'll say the archive dog ones are looking very good. It's
It's really professional now over there. Yes, it's it's down to
To the archive dog guys of course there, but yeah, I'm formatting the HTML to look nice within their framework
Yeah, they seem to be working a bit of a black art from what I understand, but yeah, good
Potential show about the subject, but it's it's very technical, so I don't not sure. Oh, yeah, please do when
Yeah, I know a lot of other podcasters are struggling with archive dog uploads
So yeah, anything that you could do to help that out our goal here is to spread the joy of podcasting don't you know
Well, that's certainly on the list and and is
Is looming so I'll get to it for too long, I think
Yeah, and I fixed one of your bugs Dave on the CC clock episode. I let the domains expire in my
in my
Cleaning up domains and I put them on my own website and then that was all
Saga just having to edit out your else and stuff
So there you go and then the next one I went to the next one on my list and then got distracted by having to tidy this house
Which I'm still not finished
So much for my week off
Yes, yes, yes, this is the way of the world I'm afraid
All right. Yeah
Incidentally, I don't know if it's worth mentioning about archive dog that
We're looking at the moment we don't necessarily upload all of the
The other components of shows to archive at all. So if you've got pictures
Which you have sent to hbr and they're on the website
They're not not not being uploaded to the internet archive
We're simply pointing back to the hbr
So really the file should be on the on the archive. So that's gonna that's a future development of the software
Yeah, exactly. I'm going to
Archive and such a fascinating problem really
It is it is it's it's once you get the your teeth into this sort of stuff you really want to
Now keep on and make it better. I find that I understand people become quite obsessed
So just control us up, but you know, it's it's you know
You're trying to do a thing for the the world at large. That's the way I feel about it anyway
So it's it's it's an important thing good reactive good work
All right, she folks
You heard the show is it community news hbr
So if you actually want to join this show and not be as depressed as I the reason I'm so depressed is
We found out our house that we renovated 14 years ago has
Got a roof that needs replacing thank you very much dodgy builders or us
And that's going to set us back a wedge of cash
so no
trips to
To foster or anything else for me for the next coming time. Thank you
Thank you very much builders who have gone bankrupt since then so yeah, no recourse
Alas, yeah, really stinks really really stinks and very sorry for you. Yeah, that's fine. Well, I mean it's it is what it is we
We yeah, we had the money put aside for your renovating the bathroom, but that's going to have to wait for another few years and then blah
So anyway, you know, there's worse we could be on a freaking boat
Um, the Mediterranean trying to get to a better life. Yeah, so first of all problems really
Okay, Dave. Okay, join us now and share the software
