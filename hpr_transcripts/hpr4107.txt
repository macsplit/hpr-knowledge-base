This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4107 for Tuesday the 30th of April 2024.
Today's show is entitled, Response to Hacker Public Radio 4165.
It is hosted by Swift 110 and is about 22 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, shout out to a shout out, I talk more about what I want in a framework laptop.
Hello everybody, this is Swift 110 and I thought it would be great to do a response to
a response to one of my latest audio posts here on Hacker Public Radio.
Did a really, really, really good job at giving this response and sharing his information
about the Intel framework that he is currently using.
I appreciate the shout out, shout out back by all means, God, that was an amazing, amazing post here
on Hacker Public Radio. Thanks again for that.
Now, what he posted was HPR, that's 4065, Framework 13, 13 Generation Intel Review.
This was in response to my post here on Hacker Public Radio and that one specifically,
once I get my, wow, there it is.
This was in response to my own personal post here and yeah, I think mine was HPR 4045.
So if you get a chance, check out my original post where I was making this,
where I'm talking about my MacBook Pro 2015 and how I look forward to someday
getting a Framework 13. Now, let me go into that.
The Framework 13 that I want in particular is the AMD version and I want the best CPU
and the most RAM that I can get in there. Like that's like top.
I know I want the AMD version from reading on Reddit and other comments I've seen online
because it has a better graphics card than the Intel version does and so I want to make sure
that if I get this new machine and I spend this new machine money that I'm going to get the
best that I can get. One of the things I really like about Framework is their repairability
and to tell you a brief story about the MacBook 2010 that I have, I was using it,
got it as a gift for free and really nice, used it for Zoom virtually every day during the pandemic
which was very critical to my mental health at the time because of everything going on in the
world at that time is ensure you can understand and so it was nice being able to communicate with
friends from different parts of the country by means of Zoom and that machine although really,
really, really old was really, really good at getting me communicate, getting me connected to friends
all over the country and so I'm grateful for having that particular machine.
It's just a beautiful thing. Now I'm going to somehow connect Apple to Framework.
Now what I appreciated about that particular machine that MacBook of 2010 is that I could take
the RAM from whatever was in there already be it two gigs of RAM or four gigs of RAM.
Oh, I could bring it all the way up to 16 gigs of RAM. Nice, right? How many machines can you do that
in modern times? Over time things got soldered, hard drives got soldered, this got soldered,
that got soldered, everybody soldered, soldered, filled me so it was good to go to a company
that I wasn't expecting to have such upgrade ability but to be able to make my machine a lot
greater than what it was before I made those upgrades. Now the upgrade again up to 16 gigs of RAM.
Okay, I'm dealing with the Core 2 Duo CPU but at least that Core 2 Duo CPU got some help because
in addition to that RAM I was able to take out the original hard drive and get a new SSD.
That was not only newer but being an SSD it has no moving parts so it's more durable,
just a better faster and also had a greater amount of storage ability.
That's definitely a plus on its own and so upgrading the RAM, upgrading the hard drive and then
going from the operating system I had on that particular machine at the time which I am going to
venture I forgot what it was and you know what it doesn't matter what it was because I ended up
putting Catalina on there. It took a long time to get it done because my internet was hot garbage
at the time but got the job done and had a functioning machine in that whole scenario so yeah
congratulations this is where Apple was doing at that time. Apple moved away from allowing their
machines to be repairable by the user and so in essence they fell from grace which is a real
dog on shame if you ask me. Now compare that to for example the T420 that I have right to my right.
Very nice machine got it back in 2016 I believe got that from a pawn shop nice but I also ended
up getting a new one from an online retailer there's a surplus in Michigan I got a nice T420 from
them and that one's really nice problem is it overheats really easily and I don't like that at all
and so it ended up not being so useful for zoom because it would just cut off randomly
which is why I rarely use it also there's an issue with the keyboard and whatever other issues I
haven't forgot about but that just is what it is the fact that I had problems with that particular
machine made me appreciate the MacBook 2010 even more and I used that MacBook 2010 until I managed
this bill just a little bit of water into the keyboard one day July a few years ago while I
remember that I have no idea and from that day on the keyboard just did not work properly the machine
was shut off randomly I had to keep it plugged in all the time just for the thing to work and hope
the goodness it doesn't come loose or anything will happen to shut it off because then I'd have to unplug
the battery I'd have to press keys do all kinds of stuff and it might come back on or it might not
sometimes I had to sit for a while I messed with it then it comes on but it was nice to just
have it on for a while but it still will be really wonky just needed a simple water real quick
but yeah not that long afterwards I was able to actually get this MacBook Pro 2015 this was a gift
and I really appreciate this machine from the time that I got it it's actually running Monterey
and I'm going to be updating that in a little bit not to a new operating system but just to
another version security version of that operating system make sure it stays up to date and I'll
stick on Monterey as long as it's reasonable to do so and then when I see fit I'll go to a later
version I'll see how far I can take that but to be honest right now I'm really happy with this
MacBook Pro in 2015 it's got 16 gigs of RAM it's an i7 processor all in all let's be more specific
about that because I'm pretty much going to talk about what I have right now and then compare
that to what I actually want with regards to framework the crowd was waiting for that talk about
the framework the actual CPU I have in here is an Intel i7 4 7 7 0 HQ I got a GPU of an Intel
Ivers Pro and I'm rocking 16 gigs of RAM what I want to have in that framework let's go to the
actual framework website lab site hmm did I really say lab site website is the framework
laptop 13 do it yourself edition AMD Ryzen 70 40 series boom boom boom let's kick on that
orange configure button shall we oh what have we got here do I really want that 70 40 series
eh I bet you I can do better than that why not go ahead and get that 78 40 you
but that 8 core and 16 thread and it comes with that big battery 61 watt hours okay that's going
to be an additional 320 over the 849 that I started off with for a whopping $1,169 okay now I'm
going to add to that even more and let's just assume that I'm configuring this machine with all
parts from framework and that I'm not getting my own from another source so let's do this DDR5
64 gigs that's another 320 dollars that ranking up to $1489 now I already got that going on
let's talk about the storage what kind of storage do I want hmm western digital black
SN770 or SN850X NVMe well the SN850X NVMe is one terabyte and it's only a couple bucks more than
$99 so what the heck let me go ahead and do that oh no operating system you're trying to get me to put
windows on this thing I will not curse this machine with windows I guarantee it so I'll tell you
what we can go ahead and click that none bring your own now we come to a bezel you see one of the
reasons that I like the framework is the fact that you can customize your machine according to
what you want you're not going to try to give me a machine that just got 8 gigs of RAM in 2024
you know why because that's absolutely ridiculous and anybody that does that ought to be ashamed
of themselves yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm talking to you I'm talking to you all right let's get back
to business here I have an option of a black bezel gray bezel orange bezel green bezel lavender
thought I was going to say it again or red let's do definitely definitely not going to happen
I'm leaning on orange gray or black don't matter so let's go ahead kick it with the keyboard US
English of course because I speak English power adapter let's say I want a power adapter do I
want a 60 watt power adapter you better bet you let's talk about these expansion chords all right
I definitely want a USB-C definitely want two USB-As I definitely want an HDMI third generation
booyah do I need Ethernet and do I need microSD maybe not now the truth of the matter is that I
already have a USB-C dock so I may not need all this to be in the machine as an expansion card but
it wouldn't hurt to have because it's just $20 for that microSD so I'm not even tripping off of that
at all um let's see what can I get right now how about we get another USB-C okay I'm already up
to 1727 dollars so $1,727 and do I want a storage expansion card 250 I don't really
need one would I would like to do is perhaps remember I told you about putting that
classic windows on this machine I don't want to put windows on that main drive but I'd be open
to using it by means of an expansion card and then having the main drive run my Linux the
distribution of Linux I'd be using is called Solus I think that would be a fantastic choice
um so that's good to go I don't necessarily need a storage expansion card off the break
so we're going to leave that fit leave that the way it is so let's go ahead
and it says make a selection for best oh you're going to make me make a selection that's okay
how about I go with black boring I know shoot me okay let's do the add to bank
1,727 dollars Jimmy crack corn and I don't care oh as it turns out I've already configured a
machine several times that's why my price is what it is because this is multiple machines wow
okay not bad but at least you get the point of what it is that I would like as far as this
particular framework machine now one of the things that I look forward to
moving from the MacBook Pro that I carry around every day right now is MacBook Pro from 2015
to a framework AMD 13 inch is that it'll be lighter probably about a pound and a half lighter
and I got to make sure I don't make up for that pound and a half I adding more into my bag than
what I need so I'll work on that so now it's nice having the machine but it will be nice to have
something new now my MacBook Pro can get a little noisy sometimes never anything really
bothersome but it is what it is what I like about the framework is that it's also a rugged design
and that appeals to me something goes wrong I can go get a new part boom pop that back in do all
the work myself and everything that is in there I meant to make this comment about Apple when you
do repair stuff sometimes you have to use a special screwdriver head I think it's called the
Pentalo whatever you call it and so the thing about the framework all you need is one screwdriver
and you can handle any piece doesn't that machine I love it I also love the fact that all the
pieces in there the components that are in there are also marked with the QR code there's also
a marketplace you can buy used pieces you can do what you need to have a new machine the way you
want it love it what else is great about the framework in particular well let's say you have a 13th
generation AMD framework better yet let me go even further let's go all the way back to when
framework first started with their 11th generation Intel I can literally take that 11th generation
Intel device and upgrade to a 13th generation CPU Intel it can be AMD for crying out loud
what other machines can you do that with I wait
psych can't do that I don't know of any other machines you can do that with where you can jump
generations like that now in the classic thingpads you could put a new you could put like a you know
a new you could put a newer CPU in there you could do some things this takes that to the next level
and I want you to understand that once you take that to the next level it means you theoretically have
a laptop that you don't need to throw away and a beautiful thing about those motherboards is that
once you're done with them you can build a whole new PC off of that isn't that awesome so you'll
always have a use for those older motherboards they won't just be sitting around gathering dust
unless that's just what you wanted to do there was something I meant to say and I don't want to
forget it because it's a very important thing um let's see let me take another sip of water
I'm hoping you can hear me right because I was using these air buds but the thing is they get
loose in my ear and they are like about to fall and then when I adjust them then it messes up my audio
and that gets really annoying that's why I like the ones that go over the ear like the hook
because then they stay in place and I don't have to have them move while I'm talking the vibration
kind of makes them come out of my ear and that's really annoying goodness is annoying
I'm trying to think of what I was about to say
I've been meaning to do air well I lost it so we're not even going to worry about that let's
go back to the recording I'm obviously still recording because that's what I do and like I said
I'm looking for a machine that I can build myself something I can really enjoy and I don't have
to make expensive repairs to it either I've learned a lot about this company ever since it came out
I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos everything different ones that have reviewed it
and shout out to Lewis Rossman as well because I appreciate the way that he is very straightforward
about what he has to say and doesn't pull punches great job thanks Lewis and it's just nice to be
able to have such a nice machine and this truly mind what I'm going for and that's what we're
going to be doing and what else did I want to say while I was here like I said I'll be using solos
on here and yeah so that's about all I really have to say at this point really I thought there was
something else I can always do another recording and follow up on what I'm saying right now
but it is what it is and I might redo this one as well but anyway this has been Swift 110 in
Athens talking about the journey from MacBook Pro 2015 to Framework AMD 13 inch Framework AMD
13th generation and how nice that would be going from a 16 gig laptop to using 64 gigs
will be really nice I'm curious how much power I'll get out of the battery life I don't see
as being a real issue I just look at it as being a really fantastic way to get on about the B1
once I get the money for it which is a whole other thing but I thank you all for listening to me
