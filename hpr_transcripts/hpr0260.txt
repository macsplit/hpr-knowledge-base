They call him the bodemaster with a stick shift
In his hand, they call him the bodemaster
He won't catch him in the end
He knew it years ago
When he started, it was his fate
Yes, that's the man we're talking about
Bigger dev yates
His podcasts are amazing
His knowledge is power
And in that Honda Civic
His podcast is 75 miles an hour
He's the winner in who I'm talking about
But ain't the Egyptian thing
That's right kids, it's Dave
From my old Linux Linux
Never heard of this grandmaster
The lesson of my friends
Want to learn about Linux
And ditch the windows in the air
No podcasts around in all the land
Has the better rates
Go listen to a lot of lot of links
Lot of Linux links
And say hi
And say hi to big dev yates
Big dev yates
And say hi to big dev yates
Yeah, last week
I did the mouse logo
The flugal horn I should say
And this week I whizzled
We're getting crazy creative around here
Yeah, so Dave, this one's for you
Thanks for your help, you support Olaika Jazz
You the man, my friend
And if you don't listen to Linux Basement, you'll never hear this
But I know you do, and I thank you
And I thank all my listeners
Take care everyone, have a great week
And love on you from theluxbasement.com community
Thank you for listening to Active Public Radio
