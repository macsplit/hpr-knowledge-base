Let's go?
Hello again this is Dave and this is Hacker Public Radio I'm recording this on the
drive home from work and my Honda Civic and today I want to talk about web based
distributed authoring and versioning or webdave or specifically how to set up webdave on your
Apache server. I'm not going to talk about how to set up Apache. I'm going to assume that
you already have Apache set up but setting up Apache isn't really that hard especially
if you're on a Debian based system. So assuming you have Apache up and running, really
the next thing you need to do is enable a couple of Apache mods and you can do this
from the command line with the command A2en mod that's Apache 2 and A1 mods with this
short for A2en mod space DAV DAV underscore FS and then after that top the command A2en mod
D again this Apache 2 and A1 mod space DAV DAV. After that you'll want to reload Apache
and you can do that of course with an Etsy init dot D slash Apache 2. I guess most
specifically slash Etsy slash init dot D slash Apache 2 space restart or force dash
reload and that will do the trick. After it's reloaded now you're on to I'm assuming also
as well that you have already already have a website running on your Apache server as
I do so the next thing you'll want to do is set up a virtual host. That way you can
host your web server without you know web dab interfering with that so next we'll create
the virtual host and you'll do this by creating a directory under the VAR Wub Wub directory
and the VAR, excuse me, the slash VAR slash, dab dab, root directory.
