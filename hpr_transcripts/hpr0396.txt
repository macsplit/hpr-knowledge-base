who listens, digs, I guess.
Like me.
It's weird. I mean, I have the same effect
with meme streams. I found stank dogs storm at the count.
I was like, you know what I was saying?
You just drops off the face of the earth. It's weird.
Okay, I think that's a sub phenomenon of the
social networking phenomenon, though.
Is that you sign up with it.
You are super active for like a good three month straight.
Possibly, you know, five if you have a job
and can access the internet on the job.
And then something changes.
And you never go there again.
Or you don't visit it like every couple,
once maybe every couple of months.
Yeah, yeah.
Like I think I have a life space.
I don't remember to call an email or anything.
It's kind of terrible.
That was really, really creepy.
Going back on life space after mapping on for a while was,
I had a few open identities I forged.
And when I began searching for Linux Geeks,
I found one.
And I was still there.
And I was like, well, that's so weird, you know.
You know, before you joined me,
we were talking about class who's a fake ID episode on HPR.
It's a lot of these.
It's a lot of these on a social network site.
Okay, yes, I do have a life space.
You found yourself in a life space.
I just found it.
Okay, that's pretty cool.
I'm going to recover that password and reintegrate yourself.
Exactly.
Especially with Defcon coming up.
Exactly.
So you know what I'd like to know is what's the difference?
What's the real difference between my space and Facebook?
I don't think there are any more.
Yeah, I don't think there are.
I mean, not really.
Especially with, you know, Facebook just making it so you can have
your username at the end of the URL.
I mean, my space has been doing that for five, six years now?
Yeah, yeah.
So is it like, you know, just a typical geek religious war,
like EMAX versus VI, you know, my Facebook.
There's a lot less religious than that, but it's probably similar, yeah.
I mean, first of all, as far as I can tell,
it's just a bunch of quizzes.
Right.
You take quizzes.
Your friends took a quiz.
See how you take the quiz and see how you compare to your friends.
And you see all of your friends and their quizzes.
It's bizarre.
It's just like a whole bunch of spam again.
I think the only quiz I took was the personality,
the psychological personality profile thing with the only one I ever did.
Otherwise, it'd be like, do you want to take a quiz?
Well, actually, no.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, there's a reason why I come on here with a handle instead of a real name.
I don't want to drop any docs on myself, particularly so.
I prefer not to.
You know, but that's something that I know you missed the last,
or the last home conference class, too.
But they had a PI speaking, and he was talking about how much easier his job became
because of my space.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You know, because people just published so much about themselves and pictures of themselves.
And he's like, he was like, what do I have left to do?
I mean, you want to know about somebody.
I saw it in my space.
I was like, wow.
Well, yeah.
I was involved in a documentary project not too long ago,
and it was ongoing, and in the course of it,
I'm curious to run away from home.
And on his MySpace page, you could see where in the country he was just by the people
who would post comments by his MySpace saying it was great to see you,
you know, like, thanks for stopping by or whatever.
And they literally found the kid from his MySpace.
I mean, literally just tracking his progress out to this hippie faster
wherever he was headed by the way that people were commenting on his MySpace.
This is not the word of fortune, new idea in America.
I don't know, Clay, too.
What you bring up is really, really interesting,
because I always thought there was something so interesting about,
when I was young, I thought it was so interesting you heard these stories about these guys
who would tell the wife they're going out for a packet of cigarettes and just disappear.
Yeah.
Now we're at the point where forging a new identity isn't just something for college guys
who want to get a drink anymore.
Now, we all kind of forge an online identity.
Correct.
You know, willfully.
Yeah.
It's like a commonplace thing.
Right.
It's so different than three decades ago.
It's so shockingly different.
I think if I was at like a conference in Manhattan again and people walked up to me
and said, hey, Deep, you can, like my mother's thing, I think she's like fall over.
Yeah.
It's really weird having people from older generations see how,
especially people within the hacker community interact with each other.
Like, I remember the look on my dad's face when he first heard someone refer to me
and he's like, what are they just calling you?
He calls me that every now and then from like, okay, stop.
You know, my dog.
It's okay.
Well, it's funny because glad to when I both listened to lug radio.
And I remember the last episode, the very last episode, they said,
maybe the guys who use handles on the internet were right, you know,
because something gets out on the internet.
It's out there forever.
And something gets out there in my space and it's out there forever.
And you have to worry about like, you know, applying for a job
and having a my space profile checked and being asked questions about doing a job interview.
Who needs that?
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, people would, lately, people have been asking me, you know,
why are you this name on Facebook?
What's that all about?
Why don't you use your real name?
I was just a thought never occurred to me to use my real name.
You know, it's just like, obviously, I wouldn't use my real name.
Right.
And it's really weird when you have to start creating multiple accounts, you know,
one for your real name, one for your handle,
because I don't want everybody that I meet at a con to find out Facebook.
But, you know, the ones that I'm friends with, I'm like, here, have my real name.
Bobbi, I mean, I actually had two genders on my space for a while.
Like I said, my wife asked me to look over my niece's shoulder,
what better way than to approach them as a 12-year-old girl.
Right.
You know, they don't have to know.
I got to tell you it was really, really weird having high school kids
just send me friend requests out of the blue one.
I just was like, oh, yeah.
That's what girls have to do with all the time.
This is horrible.
That is an interesting, that's interesting.
Yeah.
Well, you know, people think it sounds very stalker-ish.
And it's, I mean, I suppose if it wasn't because of the mode of,
I mean, my mode was honorable in doing it.
I guess if it wasn't an honorable mode of when I did it.
Well, sure.
You know, it would be stalker-ish.
But that's been going on as long as the internet, you know.
This is a picture of me in an email has always been like, yeah, sure.
Yeah, right.
I think I used my same profile picture I used on the bin rev forms on my space.
I don't want anyone to associate what they actually look like to my online persona.
Right.
Two things I found because I was trying to talk about Facebook, which I'm not a member of.
And one is that I tried to log on to Facebook.
And it had a problem with me trying to use the word geek as my last name.
Ah, yeah.
It rejected that.
And I'm like, I don't want to use my real name.
So the other thing that's really weird is that if you have a search Facebook for like old college buddies and it comes up.
And like, first of all, you know where in the world they live now.
All of a sudden, you realize they went back to some country, right?
And then it says, and if you want to communicate with them, you have to join Facebook.
Yeah.
What's this blackmail?
You must become a member to communicate with an old friend.
What did that happen?
Well, at least it's not like, what is it?
Oh, my goodness.
What's the name of that?
It's a website that...
Oh, are you talking about your book site?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
What is that stupid site?
It's like...
Classmates.com?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Classmates.com, it's like that except for, you know, you don't have to pay.
People pay for this stuff?
No, seriously.
Classmates.com, I think, charges an annual fee.
Wow.
An annual fee just to get a divorce from your wife when you find an old flame.
Every time I hear about Classmates.com, it's always...
The next thing I hear about is someone's getting divorced.
I haven't heard that, but yeah, I can see that.
You know, I mean, that's, you know, my history in high school.
I don't want to ever know anyone I want to high school with ever again.
Oh, yeah.
I know.
Me neither.
Yeah, though.
That's why they have reunions, right?
We can decide whether or not we want to show up to those and rub it stuff into their faces.
Right.
I had a friend call me up the first time they had a high school reunion.
And he said, come on.
We'll put on a good suit and jewelry and we'll brag about what we're doing.
And I said, John, I said, if you ever see me hang toward a high school reunion
and I have a brief case, you better run because there's a bomb in it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to ask you this again.
I said thank you.
Yeah.
High school reunion.
Yeah.
It's a great way to relive all the old nightmares.
Not...
Oh, right.
It's weird because I get emails from random people
throughout the week and month and they're like, oh, so and so pregnant.
So and so and so married.
I'm like, well, wait a piss in the genetic pool.
Wow.
I'm glad you...
Like, no.
Seriously.
I knew my and I are both from the Tampa Bay area in Florida.
And it's just full of people that should not reproduce.
Like, I want to forcefully revoke their privileges.
Oh, boy.
Roundtable number three.
We tried our best social networking.
And now we're talking about you, Jim.
That's what happens when you leave only three people on a roundtable.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
I wish the other guys showed up.
I sent them.
Oh, cool.
Okay.
We might have somebody else coming.
I posted something on Twitter seeing if anybody else wanted to join in.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Actually, how could we have missed Twitter speaking up Twitter?
Oh, yeah.
That's a huge one.
That's the successor of all the others, I guess.
I mean, everyone's all about Twitter now.
Yeah.
It's weird how these things come and go into fashion, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
I mean, they all provide essentially the same.
So I mean, I mean, if you talk about Facebook and my space, they're essentially providing the same thing.
You know, Tonka always said that.
Does it get an identical?
I think the only difference is with Twitter is that you restrict it to 140 characters or something.
Yeah, correct.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, they make you do short little posts.
Right.
And are they supposed to be primarily for mobile devices, too?
Uh, more or less, yeah.
I have a list of friends whose emails convert the pages at my website.
And I can't imagine, you know, that's enough for me.
I can't imagine just having tweets coming to my cell phone.
So it's very annoying.
I had to stop it.
Yeah, you tried it.
So tell us about your twin expert, Tonka.
Well, you just became the expert in Twitter here.
I know.
Please work there.
Well, um, I saw the application on my blackberry, right?
And the one that I'm using is Twitterberry.
And it's set up to alert you every time that it refreshes and there's updates,
but you can set the refresh rate.
Well, I'm following a lot of people.
So every two, three minutes, my phone's vibrating.
I'm thinking I'm getting an email or a call.
No, it's Twitter.
So it's kind of very annoying.
But when I'm on the go, like, um,
Defcon and Nauticon, Twitter came in very handy,
because I was able to find out who is where doing what talks were, you know,
worth going to see.
That's cool.
That's really interesting.
No matter fact, the founders at Nauticon hooked up a projector screen,
and that displayed all of the tweets that had something to do with Nauticon.
Oh, that's cool.
That was pretty cool.
So we could find out who is having breakfast where, grabbing drinks where.
Wow.
Yeah.
You know, you know, that's like I was trying to talk about, you know,
like you said, good reads and I said, meme streams.
Yeah.
It's like, I would be so much more interested in like knowing about what books you guys read
than about something I find randomly on the internet.
Right.
Yeah.
You know, and now you're pointing the same thing as going on with what track should we see
at the conference?
That's amazing to me.
It's really exciting, as I'm saying.
Right.
It really is.
It's very cool because, you know, before this, before the cons, all I saw were,
oh, I'm eating this and this.
I'm bored.
LOL.
Like, you guys, what the heck?
Come on.
And then when the conference started, when conferences started rolling around,
it was a lot more interesting.
And then, you know, if you're not able to attend a conference, people are tweeting,
quotes, and information that they're getting during the presentation.
It's very awesome.
Wow.
So basically, you got to kind of be in it so that one of the avalanche flows in.
Yeah.
I'm trying to rephrase it so I see if I understand.
When it does become very active, you're in the right position to get the stuff you want, right?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I guess that's the appeal.
I mean, on a really larger scale, that's the appeal of social networking.
It's kind of like, when it's good, it really is good.
You know, you meet old friends or you've made really good new friends who you talk to like a lot
or you're getting updates on, you know, whatever activities you want to get updates on.
And that's the cool part of it.
The stupid part is, you know, the stupid advertising or the quizzes or, you know, just the spammers who get on there, I guess.
Right.
Just thinking about the internet, I guess.
Yeah.
I mean, that's the amazing thing.
That's another thing, though, because I was interested in fun and good podcasts.
And so I'm trying to do that with Dig, right?
And I actually found one that was specifically supposed to be for podcasts.
But there's, I guess you would call it a critical mass.
There's a point where one of these sites doesn't have enough people
so that you can't get enough good action and find enough good feeds to follow.
You know, because I wanted a small one and it was just like, you know, you would get a new post every month
and be like, I'm not, it's not worth my time.
But like, how so many people are on Twitter and so many people on my space and whatnot.
All of a sudden, it becomes very worthwhile because you have some variety of shoes from.
You know, is that kind of critical mass there?
Yeah, that's a good point, because there's a point of, I don't know, it seems like when a social networking site gets, you know, too popular,
it just starts to break down.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Yeah, like Facebook and my space and Frinscher before that.
You know, all these little networking sites, I don't know if it's their fault or if it's the user's fault
or both, but at a certain point, they, whatever, they're at the sad passes and when it moves on or it works.
But maybe it's just got really bad and people have to move away from it.
Yeah, you know, I don't know if you want to look at it as the system breaks down.
May or may not be the right way of looking at it.
Well, not to interrupt you, I'm sorry.
It could be very comparable to IRC networks even or IRC channels.
So there's a point where, you know, when it's a small group of people or, you know, even a large group of people,
but, you know, they respect each other and they're self-policing.
Yeah.
It worked out beautifully, but then it deteriorates and you end up with something like 2600 net.
Right, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking like, my space gets more, let's say, as a hypothetical.
My space gets more and more popular before this any comparison.
Some people say, oh, I'm getting too much garbage.
A lot of people leave.
All of a sudden, people who are really there for what they think were good are still there, aren't they?
So is it like a purification thing going on?
It could, yeah.
I mean, you could look at, like, you know, two sites of a coin, right?
But there's also a lot of inherent threats with using social networking sites as well.
I've got a lot of people overlook.
What were the downsides?
Well, there's a lot of fishing scams.
Like, I don't know if you've seen, I think it was Sean Moyers talk at DefCon last year.
The video should be up.
It's really interesting.
Let me see if I can bring it up to that exact title.
Yeah, he did a thing called Satan is on my friend's list, attacking social networks.
That's cool.
It was very interesting.
And he went on a whole bunch about using arbitrary code, a hack soup of client site user generate HTML.
It was a very, very well done talk done by Sean Moyer and Nathan Hamill.
If you guys have a chance to look at it, I'd definitely recommend it.
You know, you know, you know, it's, you know what I really like having on my Firefox when I go on to these things?
It's a no script plug-in.
Yeah.
Are you guys, you're just unanimous?
Yes.
I mean, because you don't know what they're going to suck in.
Exactly.
And they just arbitrarily copy and paste whatever they get from, you know, free MySpaceLayouts.com or whatever.
Yeah, yeah, totally.
And I also find out that and I haven't done this since I was a dial-up guy.
I also like to turn off image, automatic image loading when I go on MySpace initially.
If I'm really just browsing around MySpace, I like to turn off images.
Why do you do that? Is that a security thing?
You just mean that it's annoying.
I just because, I mean, the amount of images loaded.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if it's the hack for other things, or if it's just a MySpace phenomena, but it can kill you.
I think it's just MySpace.
I mean, people put just all kinds of ridiculous things on those pages.
Did you ever look through an image cache after going on MySpace?
Oh, it's kind of scary.
It's kind of scary, yeah.
I always said, you're like, did I visit something I had to do with this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And that's, of course, one of my favorite things to do if I sit down with friends computers,
find the image cache for their Firefox right away.
You know, look at that and see what's going on.
Now, you know, there's a vulnerability.
I heard that, and I was listening to, you were to hate this one.
It's called the NacillaCast.
It's like a Mac podcast editor.
Very commercial.
Oh, great.
I mean, she has advertisers.
I mean, she has a great presentation, but it's all, what software you can buy and what not.
And I'm like, software buy?
Yeah.
You know, I use the Mac.
I don't get it, you know.
But anyway, they were talking about tweets or limited to 140 characters.
People often have to use the URL shorteners.
On the website, like the tiny URL.
Right.
And they click on those things without knowing where they're going.
Yeah.
You know, that's, you know, something we would never do with an email.
We old were trained to stop doing that with emails, but it's coming back now.
Yeah.
And there's not even a way, like, especially if you use programs like, um,
Tweetback, which, uh, filters, it organizes your, uh,
friend plus tweets.
There's no way that you can, um, see where a link really goes to.
Yeah.
I heard there was some plug-in that did look it up before I could go there,
and at least give you, like, a display on the bottom of your screen,
but I don't catch the name of it.
I think it was so far specific if I'm not mistaken.
There's another one.
Yeah.
There's a website, and I don't know the name of it off the top of my head,
but it does let you, you can paste in the tiny URL or whatever,
and it will be curved before you, or, you know, see where it points to,
or something like that, so that you actually can kind of figure out where you're going.
Yeah, that's it.
That's, that's like a service like, like, was my api.com,
that's like a service webpage?
Yeah, you know, it's like, uh, yeah.
I don't remember the name of the site, though.
I think Lifehacker featured something as well.
Probably.
Yeah.
Like, a couple months ago.
There should be a plugin for Firefox that lets you, like, scope out the URL before that.
That would be really cool, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That'd be a good one.
You know, let's get all that deep geek.
Yeah, well, maybe I will.
I don't know.
Yeah, every once in a while, I go to the Hacker Public Radio thing,
and I post an email called Wishlist, and I give just fly-out topics I would like to see other people do,
because I have my own tangent I'm on at the moment.
And I just include that, because Hacker Tools for Firefox might be a good one to have an HPR episode on.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that'd be pretty cool, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you know, the other one that someone was mentioning to the other day,
and I don't even know if you guys have any experience with it, I'd down it,
but it's called LinkedIn.
And it's apparently a professional MySpace service.
Yeah.
I think I have a LinkedIn account, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The top of the topic is on every social networking.
Yeah.
The Holy Folk token, cool.
What's that?
I don't know.
Well, I hear about them.
I just find up, and then I forget about them.
And people are like, hey, Tony, I found you on here.
I'm like, that's nice.
I didn't even know I had one.
Yeah.
That's a requirement.
If you use the web, you have to find up for every new site that you hear about.
Well, not only that, but I don't want anyone else signing up with token costs.
It doesn't matter if you know if I'm going to use or not.
I don't want anybody else walking around with my handle.
That is a good point, yeah.
I was so shocked to find the deep geek was taking on my space.
Really?
Yeah.
I had to become deeper geek.
I just had to, you know, but it was like an eventually the guy that actually was funny with the guy was one of my listeners.
And I sent him a friend request, and he wasn't logging in at the moment for whatever reason.
And then I said, yeah, I said that on my on the talk geek to me.
I said, yeah, I found a guy on my space.
That's my handle.
And then he emailed me.
And I was like, wow.
So weird.
Yeah.
But LinkedIn is pretty cool.
It's a good way, you know, kind of like my space.
Well, no.
Like original Facebook needs career builders.
You post your resume up there.
You find your buddies and connect with them.
And then they put recommendations for you.
And you put recommendations for them so that if you're looking for a job, you can be like, oh, look at my LinkedIn.
I know so and so.
It's an easy way to name drop.
Okay.
Do people really go to social networking sites to find people to hire?
I don't know.
I haven't heard of them.
You know, I don't know.
But I mean, I did get a random call the other day on my cell phone from somebody who apparently had found my resume on monster.com
and was looking to hire.
Unfortunately, I don't check my messages, but like once a month, so it was way overdue.
But I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess some companies look at these kinds of amazing.
I don't think that one works for that kind of company though.
It makes you wonder because I mean, that's why I wasn't due bombs that I missed the message.
All these sites have different kinds of reputations.
And I mean, if you think about it, I mean, if you're looking to hire people who are my space users, what does that say about the firm?
My space has that, I mean, I've heard one comparison where they said my space is like the ghetto version of Facebook.
You know, so I mean, it makes you wonder.
I mean, they got to be getting pretty desperate if they're going to my space and such.
But I mean, you know, go on back to what that PI said.
I mean, posting your resume online.
Right.
I find that amazing.
I really think you're too honestly.
I mean, talk about an identity thief's idea.
You know, you could like, you know, make the same resume change in the address and like try to take someone over someone by the ID.
I've heard some people actually put their social security numbers around their resume.
Oh my God.
That's pretty bad.
I wouldn't be surprised though.
No, not at all.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's a good point, D.D., actually.
So I mean, how much in your my space experience?
I mean, you find a lot of people post like a lot about themselves on their my space, really?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's scary what some of the information you get on my space.
I remember when I was in high school.
God, who's going to date me now.
We were on a shared PDP 11.
Oh wow.
And oh, I love that system so much.
And each school has own project number.
There's a pair of numbers you logged on with.
And we would regularly scan for text files in the neighboring high schools.
We had a low enough permission for us to read them.
And then we got to a point where we were going to be writing parodies of each other's schools.
Lowering the, lowering the protection.
And other people would read them in other high schools.
And we would hear back about it through the teachers' aids.
Because the teachers' aids would often have kids in other high schools.
And be like, your file got out to Mepham, you know.
Or something like that.
And be like, ah, you know.
It was hysterical to do.
And it wasn't a unique idea because other people were looking to read them.
What about parodies of my space?
I heard, I'm opening a web browser right now.
I heard there's something called my dead space.
Which was really?
Nothing but my space pages of people who passed away.
And I never even tried to access it before.
Nope.
Nope.
No, it's coming up something that's not related to my space at all.
My dead space.
Okay.
I'm a spam page I just got.
Oh, my death space?
Possibly.
Welcome to mydeathspace.com.
Oh, that's what it's called.
My death space.
Oh, there's this cute little graphics of tombstones on here.
Wow.
It's an archival site containing news, articles, online obiturers,
and other public or relevant information.
I recently deceased myspace.com members.
Why are I a common system?
Oh, Michael Jackson's at the top.
How's more been there?
Oh, man.
And David carried it right under him.
How bizarre is this?
That's pretty funny.
Paul Newman's at the bottom.
Is he?
Yeah.
This is pretty gross.
Who's this skeleton with a horn in this mouth?
You know, we talk about privacy and the information published on myspace.
And you guys ever read this book written by Johnny Long called Google Hacking?
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Do you think those kinds of techniques could be applied to myspace to Google?
Without a doubt.
Yeah.
I wonder what you could get by mining myspace with hacking techniques.
Yeah, really.
Oh.
I try to look at it.
I try to see, you know, if Google could keep good track of people linking to myspace
pages from outside of myspace.
And there was some activity, but not a lot.
I want to say filter or if they even index it like the index of the normal web.
Any speculation?
No idea.
Yeah.
Well, the same way.
I mean, they obviously index it.
That's a good question.
I would be interested in knowing that too.
I could see them actually coming up with some kind of exceptional rule for that,
just because it is so enormous.
What about second life?
Forget about second life.
You guys consider that social networking?
I've actually never used second life.
I've used it briefly just to see what it was all about.
I'm afraid of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if that sounds ominous, but I mean I lost maybe six or seven years of my life
to something called SimCity.
Oh, yeah.
And you were called SimCity?
Not only that, but I still have to keep SimCity on a QMU image.
You know, I haven't used it so long.
I still have to have it there.
You have to have it.
Yeah.
And I'm just afraid that the second life sounds like it's going to suck me in.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I didn't suck me in by any means.
It did strike me as a very my spacey kind of theme where you create your little online identity
and you make friends like I said, I wasn't on that long.
It wasn't really into it.
But yeah, I mean it's the same idea.
It's just that instead of surfing web pages, you're going to people with little lands
or shop looking around and talking to people.
I think it's a form of social networking, but I think it's inconvenient enough
so that it can't really catch on as much as something like my space,
which in theory you could check at school or work,
whereas something like second life and you have to install a client
and you can't really play it off if the boss walks in and you're hanging out in second life.
Access from school.
That's an interesting phrase you choose, Cloud 2.
Any musings on using these social networking sites as like a cloud computing kind of model
like keeping stuff there so that you can log into it from different places
or is that I'm just ridiculous.
Well, I don't think it's ridiculous.
I do think that the social networking sites are typically targeted for being blocked
so it kind of makes it almost a bad choice if you're going into public places.
I mean, I've seen stores that actually block my space on Facebook just because they don't want people
standing on the computer, on the demo computers checking their my space
and their Facebook and all these other things.
Obviously, people who know about the proxy servers will get there anyway,
but at least for a lot of people, that's blocked.
So I think that's sort of a bad choice for that kind of, for using it for that use.
I don't know how much storage they really give you anyway.
I mean, you'd be hard to make good use of what any of these networking places would give you.
I was just clicking around my deathspace.com
and here's a story.
It was in latest articles.
It took about information getting out.
And the guy's name, his age, died in the mode of vehicle accident cook.
He's a soldier.
And it tells how they get to their my space page where he lived.
The date he was alive.
There's a lot of information out here.
There's a scary amount of information out here.
Well, I don't know, guys.
You think we exhausted the topic?
Possibly.
It's too bad.
Nobody else showed up.
Yeah, too bad.
So punk.
I know.
But I think we certainly had quite an exchange at any rate.
Oh, yeah.
I kind of missed what your death comes to talk was going to be on.
I didn't hear what you said.
It was about a neurohacking.
Oh, yeah.
I'm speaking about neurohacking, specifically using devices that you can create and program yourself
to avoid getting the signs and symptoms of motion sickness.
Cool.
Okay.
And DeepEek, what are you working on now?
You're doing your podcast talk to me?
Yeah.
Developing TalkEek to me at TalkEekToMe.us.
And, you know, just trying to beat back the real world so I can keep getting out to a month.
Right.
My friend, Enigma, has graciously allowed me to...
I can't be the idea of syndicating my old shows because mine go into creative comments after three months.
So that's going to be storm next month.
Oh, okay.
So, you know, so if people want to get it, they can get it in different ways now, I guess.
Doing a lot of research.
I script my shows, you know, so it takes me time to do each one.
Okay.
Well, cool.
Thanks, Tutankoff.
What's coming up?
What's bad apples, Klatu?
Yeah.
Nothing deep geek.
The same as usual.
Nothing.
Nothing fans want to know.
I know.
I know.
Actually, you know, I'm doing a...
I do kind of a review-ish of Open Solaris.
I lived in Open Solaris for about a week and a half.
That's how it's interesting.
Yeah, it was interesting.
And then I'm going to do, you know, kind of how to go to Slackware Current just because I think...
I've been getting a lot of questions about, like, Slackware Current and Slackware and stuff like that.
So, I've been trying to fool around and trying to get going with...
G&U, Debbie and G&U KFreeSBD, FreeBSD, which is...
Debian with a FreeBSD kernel instead of a Linux kernel.
Wow.
So, that's a really interesting project.
I mean, just the concept of choose your architect to choose your kernel and choose your user space.
Those guys get off the ground.
That's going to be something else.
Yeah, that does sound cool, actually.
So, you know, fooling around with that.
Well, I want to do a little bit more research into the benefit of kernel and stuff like that.
Tony, what did you go to school for?
Or did you go to school?
MIA, management and information systems.
Okay.
All right.
So, what about the management group or the one off about the computer department?
They're trying to be technical.
Uh-huh.
Like, it's weird.
I'm actually finishing it up right now.
They're offering a security-focused path.
But I'm seeing here that I'm face-palming through most of them.
Like, I have to sit there and correct someone on the definition of hacker at least.
I plan for some Esther.
Like, no, dear, that's a cracker.
No, we're not all from China.
I promise you.
There's a place called Defcon, really?
Tell me about it.
I have no idea.
It's always fun to correct your computer science features.
So, how did you get into, like, how did you get into the whole studying for your Defcon talk?
And I would have, after you said what the topic was on, I would have almost thought you were like doing some kind of bioscience degree or something.
So, I started all studying to be a forensic pathologist.
Okay, okay.
Wow.
But then I'm like, hmm, eight years of school, huh?
Playing with dead people the rest of my life you say?
Hmm.
Less than 60 grand a year?
Hmm.
No, thanks.
I know, I mean, I grew, I literally grew up in an IT department.
So, it was just, after I thought about it, it just made more sense for me to go this way.
So, when I try to come up with project ideas, I try to think of things that, you know, help me involve technology and the biology stuff.
So, I don't think I wasted four or five years of my life.
It's very cool.
I mean, it sounds like a really cool topic.
Beyond Rain actually does a whole bunch of stuff with Neurohacking as well.
She and her co-presenter created a video game which is basically face invaders.
And you make your own EKG machine, you know, the heart rate monitor.
It's hooked up to your computer and based on how fast your heartbeat is,
that controls how fast the aliens come down in the game.
That's insane.
That's wild.
It's like, as you get more stressed, your heartbeat's picking up, but that's making it all worse because...
Oh, that's so brilliant.
Well, cool.
Okay, so, thanks for coming on, guys.
And a pleasure.
Thank you.
And everyone who is listening, thanks for listening, until next time.
Thank you for listening to Hacker Public Radio.
