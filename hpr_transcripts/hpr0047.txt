Welcome to this episode of Hacker Public Radio, this is Zoke again, doing part 2 in the
System Tunnel Suite.
So hopefully you've downloaded the programs.
I've got my wife's computer up and running and I'm going to be running through some of
the programs on there and explaining what some of the options are and what the output
is.
The files downloaded are zip files.
You can extract them out wherever you want, they're just plain executable to be installed
or anything fancy.
When you extract them, for example, here I've got the Auto Runs program, we have four
files, Auto Runs.chm, which is the Help File, Auto Runs XC, which is the GUI version,
the Windows version, Auto Runs SC.exe, which is the DOS-based version and the Euler.txt,
which is that wonderful end-to-user license agreement, basically saying if you die it's not
Microsoft fault.
So if we go and fire up Auto Runs, it takes a little while to load here.
And we have a window with lots of options here, everything log on Explorer, Internet Explorer,
Schedule Tasks, Services, Drivers, Boot Execute, etc, etc.
Everything, obviously, has everything and if you want only part of it, it's like the
Internet Explorer.
Once you just click on the Internet Explorer tab and it comes up with various things
like the Browser Help Objects.
The Browser Help Objects are basically the toolbars and I can see here that we have
Adobe PDF read-link helper twice actually, but we have that listed down and it tells you
that wherever file is, it's C-Pregumphiles Adobe Acrobat 7.0, ActiveX, A-C-R-O-I-E,
Helper, D-L-L. There's a checkbox you can simply uncheck that and that will stop the
program from running.
It doesn't actually delete it from the registry or keep it there.
What you can actually do is click on the link you want to remove and click Delete or click
the little X at the top or Control-D, it says Frish or Cut.
I'm going to go and delete one of these PDF ones, probably better leave the other one
the WIFE way upset, but personally, I can't stand Adobe and the way it takes far too
much of your memory and process of power.
So we can look through here and see what we've got, we've got the ZoneLarm spy block
at BHO, leave that one in ZoneLarm, wouldn't be my choice of firewall, but works pretty
well for the less technical.
We can go through everything and list some of the options here.
We have far too much stuff, we've got quick time while that can go, hate quick time, that
takes up far too many things.
Which of other weird stuff, MochaSoft did installs all the manner of bizarre things.
If you're worried about some of these, you can then do a quick search on them through
Google or something and I actually find out whether there's spyware malware or just
not very good generally.
One example, if I can find it, was the iTunes stuff, it has an odd name, I can't find it,
I don't know, the name is French and it's just confusing.
Most of the other stuff actually does say Apple, I should say Apple software update job,
that makes sense.
It has Apple in the name, whereas the one that actually runs, okay, finally found that.
Yes, it's the Bonjour service, Bonjour, the French for literal translation, good day.
It's kind of a silly name and if you saw that just running, you'd think what the hell's
Bonjour, you know, it sounds a bit odd.
Some of these spyware things, they're trying to call themselves things that might sound
reasonable but just seem a little odd and that's one of the ones there.
Now I know the wife's computer's fairly well kept up to date because I run stuff on
it, saves me having to faff around fixing it when she does something she shouldn't
do, like that time she got the Sony DRM crap from a CD and we still can't get the CD
ROM driver to work properly, at least burning CDs.
Anyway, so you can go through all the different options here, network providers and you can
see you've got the LAN Man workstation and it's fairly self-explanatory for most of those.
And again you can just go through, you can even uncheck them which keeps them in the registry
or the files around but means they won't run or you can delete them which means it removes
them entirely.
So there's a few of them I've got here that what I generally do is if I don't like the
look of it I will just uncheck them and reboot the computer and see what's going on and
then I can just check them back if I deleted something I shouldn't have done, like that
one time I broke the computer and stopped Windows from accessing the internet but that's
another story.
That's about it for auto runs.
Next up we've got BG info, now again this is a fairly simple program it just great text
on the background.
When you run the program it gives you a list of options that you can, what text you put
on there, boot time, CPU, default gateway, DHCP server, DNS server, free space, hostname,
internet explorer, version IP address, logon, domain logon server, MAC address, machine
domain memory, network card, network speed, network type, OS version, service pack, snapshot
time, subnet mask, system type, username and volumes.
You can get these displayed around on the screen you can choose whether you want to copy
the user's wallpaper settings and then add it in or just stick in the corner, make the
wallpaper visible behind the text, put it on top left top right, well any of the nine
corners sides or middle of the screen you can choose whether it goes on on the desktop
sort or for console use or terminal server users and you can actually run a preview.
As I said fairly useful if you actually run test environments and things there is a
nice little preview screen option here which tells me all these exciting things default
gateway, 192.168.10.1, the same DHCP server, same DNS server, free space, 31.38 gig,
NTFS on C, the hostname which I won't mention, internet explorer version, all these stuff
that can be interesting and useful to you if you're testing.
Well I think that's enough about that, I'm going to remove all this before the wife
complains what's this weird stuff on my computer.
Next was blue screen, I'm not actually going to talk about that because if you don't know
how to run a screen save up then what on earth are you doing listening to something like
this, contig makes things contiguous, contig exy, system terminal software, license terms,
blah blah blah yes, I guess we have to agree to that.
It's really exciting, standard Windows stuff.
If you run contig, it's dust-based program, relies on entities built in DFrame support
to make specified file contiguous on the disk, use the top noise execution of a few
currently used files, basically you just run it, you've got a couple of options, V for
the Bose, A for analysed fragmentation, Q for quiet, so if you do contig dash, A it comes
down and tells you which file you want to check, so contig dash, A, C come on back, slash
start at star, I'm not going to do the entire directory and it comes down and tells you
what's going on, this file is defagmented, it will look this file is being used by something
else, I've got a lot of windows for that, 51 files, one fragment, one frag per file, so
all defagmented, mainly because I ran it last week, defragged everything, but you can run
that against specific files if you're having issues with some being rather big and bloated.
Next one is file one, if you run the file one exy, again have to agree to software license
terms on the new versions, didn't have to on the old versions, straight away we have
a huge amount of stuff, VS Mon is doing something accessing, C windows, internet logs it looks
like, right click on that, exclude process, don't want to hear about that, SV host is doing
well everything, it seems to be accessing documents and settings, windows, the root directory
everything, select exclude that process, CSRSS has got a bunch of many S's for my liking,
it's accessing lots of things, windows, manifests or something, right click exclude process, AVG,
CC, XC, well antivirus is running everything, right click exclude process, AVG server, exclude
process, ZL client, that's a firewall, exclude process, explore exes doing stuff, exclude
process, win logons doing stuff, exclude process, okay I think that's about everything, now
if we go and run something, let's find something interesting shall we, internet explorer that
will be a laugh, run internet explorer and we can see exactly what it does, internet explorer
is loaded up, let's go to Microsoft, Microsoft wait for it to load up, Microsoft.com, no connection
to the internet is currently available, well I'm on the internet, try again, now it works
and it's loading, something, it's still loading and we're done, I'm actually on DSL if
you can believe that, I blame the wife's computer, or just windows generally, so here we
go, let's close that down for now, let's see what it did, so we've got the logs here, huge
amounts of things, the scroll bar is, the scroll bar is incredibly small, it's about
three pixels wide, but I'll just read some of this stuff out, so in iExplore XC, it
able to read request, tells you the specific path, it was opening itself, it was a success,
offsets and length and stuff like that, file information, tells you what was going on,
anything interesting here, oh it's trying to open up, cconon backslash, dollar extend
backslash, and it was accessed in id, that's interesting, I wonder what's in the dollar extend
directory, and why exactly, we have a dollar extend directory, I don't like things with
dollars in front, dollars are, dollars normally the hidden files, hidden shares for example,
they just make me a little nervous, so I'll be looking through that and trying to work
out what's going on with that, what else has it been doing, it goes down to documents
and settings, all users application data, Google to find stuff, it goes to my DSC, whatever
that is, it goes down to my cookies, it goes to my temporary internet files, my history
goes for some reason, it goes to a different account for my boss mother, it actually opens
the my documents up, it goes in there, and here's another old one, making note of that,
have a look at that in a moment, try and work out what's going on there, all right, it's
loading up Adobe Acrobat, ask people, office stuff, yeah, it's opening up the C-Progress
Squiggle 1, that is like Mozilla, I know it's a tilde, I just call it a squiggle, it looks
like a squiggle, it's a squiggle, because if you turn around to people and say it's the
tilde, they say what the hell is the tilde, so it's a squiggle, you say the squiggle, top
left of the keyboard, and they say oh yeah, the squiggle, so if I call it a squiggle, that's
why, C-Progress, squiggle 1, Mozilla, squiggle 1, okay, for some reason it appears to be
opening Firefox app or something there, not quite sure why, but possibly Thunderbird,
actually, if that might make sense, it opens, I mean it's a ton of stuff, this is barely
50th of the way through, and it's opening up a ton of files and success, success, success,
sharing violation, I'll never see that in Windows 2, but it goes through all these, and you
can actually see exactly what files it's opening, so if you do get a program that errors,
if for example, you ran a program that errors and said file not found, very useful, didn't
tell you what file, you can run this, file monitor as I said, you'll have to filter out
all these things, you can say it was a standard filter set, and then you can run it and
you see exactly what file, exactly why, buffer overflow, well that's an explorer for
you, shocking, you know, a Microsoft product might actually have a buffer overflow, but
apparently MDM XC query information for I explore, and it has a buffer overflow, well I
never, you live and learn, car, Microsoft buffer overflows, yes, that sarcasm for anyone
that didn't quite get it, well here we go, couple of file not founds, don't really care,
it's, I really don't give a shit about it, but it's going to open various things here
and fading on some of these, cprogram files into the explorer, I explore xc.local, but
you can run these and see exactly what's going on, and why it's erroring, which is pretty
cool, and that's file one, okay, next up we have handle, run handle xc, it's a dust
one, all right, go into dust, go into the handle directory, and run handle xc, and watch
the screen flood by quickly, we have a ton of stuff here, but it will show exactly every
single file that we have open here, you'll actually want to grab or search through to find
the specific files that you find interesting here, but you know, it's opened up c.c.c.c.c.c.
things, my name, my actual name not zoke, but I'm not going to say it, local settings
history, history.a5 index, that, I'm different, read, write, so I mean you can see what's
it's got open, kind of similar to file one, but works just once, just for the moment,
I think that's about it for handle, list DLLs, which is another dust based one, tells
you exactly what versions of each DLL, so here we've got MSV CP60, so much of visual
CP for plus presumably, version 6.0 DLL, version 6.0 2.310 4.0 0 0 0 0 0, list of DLLs and
the version numbers, that can be pretty cool, if you're looking for a specific version
number, we wrote our own programs at work, and as I said, if you're looking for a crystal
report, screw up the wrong version number in the DLL, which I realized when listening
through, I actually called something else entirely, but the version number on the DLL, and
you can see what's right and what's wrong, so you can just look through that, that's pretty
cool, you can just get that run on a computer, and then you can analyze the file pretty easy
to write a simple program, just to load up a text file, output from here, and run it
through and see what versions of what DLLs are there, and what is missing to quickly
find what is the wrong one, alright, log on sessions, which is probably going to be a
DOS one again, I don't know what guess it is, and we have 5, 6 actually, because it starts
to 0, 6 log on sessions here, do we have, my wife is apparently logged on, a non-existent
blank user name is logged on, the NTO Authority Network Services Logon, NTO Authority Local
Service NTO Authority, anonymous login, and I'm logged on, exciting, totally when everyone
logged in, so the wife apparently got up at 6.52 and 16 seconds in the morning, and logged
on, which is when pretty much everything else started, or a few sex later, and I logged
on, 6 hours later, again this can be used for each one of the work out, exactly what's
running, if this machine was actually facing the internet, I'll be a little worried about
having these network services running, and I want to tie them down, well as much as
you can tie down a window session, anyway, alright, page de-frag, page de-frag comes
in lists, files, and the fragments, so, c, hyper fill, sys has 61,133 clusters and one
fragment, well exciting, pretty simple, you have an option for de-fraggin xboots or de-fraggin
every boot or don't de-frag, and that's basically the choices you have, you also have a choice
of saying how quickly before you abort, so you can have a 10 second time out, and you
can quickly click the button and it will cancel, running on your own computing, well as
we'll say de-frag every boot, if you're one of these people that you need, you turn the
computer and you go off and get a coffee, you can do that, that's nice and simple, and
if you don't you've got the 10 seconds or whatever to hit the button and cancel, if you
run the set it and you just decided to actually, you don't want to do it, you can just run
it again and un-set it, you just click the don't de-frag option at the bottom, that's pretty
simple, process explorer, so we have sysmodel process, interrupts, dpc, systems got about 18
versions of svc host, why I really don't know, it just always does, but the cool thing about
this, we can look under here, sysmodel process, system, sss, xe, windlogging, xe, service, xe,
so each one's calling the other one, then we have svc host, xe, and we hover over one of those,
we see the first one is the de-com service, process, launch, de-com launch, terminal services,
next one is remote procedure called rpc, next one is for, next one's for about 8 services
here actually, but we make updates and stuff, you can see exactly what everything is running,
and you can actually right click and say kill process, kill process, tree restart, suspend,
debug, separarities and so on, and it actually tells you what they are real times 24,
highs 13 and above normal 10, normal is 8, below normal is 6, 9, just 4, okay, we'll have to explain
this briefly, it is very, very complicated, but basically in a very simple way, the higher number
is how it gets run, so the processor is running away at stuff, the mouse and the keyboard,
the processor is a real time basically 24 or 30 or something, I think the process number as I forget,
whenever the CPU is idle, it sees if anything is pulling it, it goes through the interrupts,
and so the mouse hits an interrupt, the keyboard hits an interrupt, the hard drive, everything
will hit an interrupt when it needs anything, the computer does go through and check the interrupts
for the highest number, the highest number is actually the king, basically every second it will
check whatever the highest number is, and whatever is requesting part of the processor's time,
and how's a higher number it will win, it is a lot more complicated than that because otherwise,
whatever is the highest process is always taking precedence, there are entire books, doctoral
thesis have been written on this subject, basically the higher number wins, so if you set a process
up to real time, and it wants to do a lot of stuff, you will not do anything on your computer
until it is finished, if Firefox for example is being a river resource hog, which unfortunately
it is sometimes, going to here, right click set process and set it to be below normal,
or idle, or something lower, then what it will do is actually give you your computer back,
because you might find the mouse is not moving because Firefox is taking all the memory,
well now because it's below normal or idle, you move the mouse, it's got a higher number, it
gets priority, explore itself, everything starts as normal, if you find a process is taking up too much,
if you CPU time, just set it down to below normal, and most of the time it's going to give you
a computer back, whatever it is doing is going to take three times longer than normal or something,
because everything else is now getting in a way, but you can still use your computer,
so if you actually wanted to use your computer whilst doing something else, do that,
if on the other hand you just want to leave the computer and let something run, put it up as high,
I really don't recommend doing real time, set something as real time, you pretty much guarantee
your computer will crash, because it can't do anything else, which is not good,
I mean see all the programs here, you can see X4 or XC for example, it's got HK command XC,
which is the keyboard, it's got a couple of extra keys and that's the thing that does that,
AVGCCXC, the Google Toolbar Node Fire command XC, Proce XC, because of course that's what I ran,
as I said it's all this up there and you can see what's running and terminate them, and it's
basically pretty damn good, there's also a search online option, which I don't remember being
there last time, and in fact if we do that, we notice Proce XC now has launched Firefox,
Firefox is running away, it's got a process idea of 2644, it's using flashes on and off,
stuff it yes, just Google searches, basically, nice and simple, but you can see exactly what's
running, what called what as well, so as I said you can see here that X4 or XC called Proce XC,
because of course I'm running a Windows Explorer session and I ran it from there, so X4 or XC
called that, it's basically a pretty damn cool debug tool and it works better as a replacement
for task manager as well, you can do pretty much everything task manager does,
possibly shut down, there might not be an option, oh no, there we go, there's an option to shut
down, it does everything task manager does and does it better, screw task manager use process explorer
instead, Rookit Revealer, open up that, except the license, hit scan, bottom right hand corner,
just hit enter, it's the default button, run stuff, it dumps the registry down, it tells you what
it's doing and then it compares what the registry says the files are on the hard drive and what
files actually are on the hard drive, trying to think of an analogy, Star Trek 6, though
can work out if they fired a torpedo or not, their computer said they fired a torpedo, they were
fairly convinced they hadn't, they went down and counted every single torpedo, found out the
computer had lied to them and it was wrong, that's basically what Rookit Revealer does, it turns
around to windows and says what files are we got, what have we got here, what have we got there,
windows says well we've got you know 43 torpedoes, it then goes and counts manually and finds 44
and says hang on, this isn't right, it will come up with anything that is hidden from windows
itself, the operating system, not necessarily a bad thing, certain things if you're using
Norton, well first of all why are you using Norton, but if you're using Norton, safe delete or
whatever their version of the recycle bin is called, if you're using that what it does it hides
files from the operating system in a bit of a weird way but it makes it so that people can't
find the files but they are available in Norton if you want to delete them, that will turn up
in Rookit Revealer because there's a file on the hard drive, the operating system doesn't know about,
so don't just assume everything you see is bad, most of it isn't to be honest, what have we got
here for example, HKLM which is spreadsheet key, the local machine, software, lick control, lick that
that's LIC, Dan calm down, lick control slash, lick control slash, lick control slash, lick control
bunch of weird character star, LKZ, lots of weird stuff, so basically that's saying here's
something that's hidden and the reason that's hidden is actually that's the license control, I believe
that is ZEDMUD, actually look that is but it's it's something my wife bought and she's got the
license on the computer and that's what it didn't because you don't want just anyone to be able to
see the license, so there's a few weird things like that, basically run it, look on the internet,
see what stuff you've got on there because most of it's not bad, well I'm going to bore that now
because I can, you're going to let it run, it takes, I don't know, half an hour, so it depends
on how big the hard drive is, how fast the computer is, really cool program run it,
TCP view seems to be taking a while, load license agreement, yay, what does it say in a way,
schedule for license, license is, the software is license, not sold, the
screaming only gives you some rights to use the software, the internal materials, all other rights,
and that's applicable law gives you more rights than the despite this limitation,
basically we're not going to give you any chance to do anything unless you really, really
must have to, and even then we're going to argue about it, you may not do anything to this program,
apart from run it, you may not lend the software, so I can't actually give the software or lend
the software to you on a disc, even though it's free download, how stupid is that, you can't export
it, subject to the United States export laws and regulations, the software is as is,
well it says most open source really, so I can't argue about that,
outside the United States if you acquired this software in, sorry let's do the series first,
outside the United States if you acquired this software in any other country, the laws of that
country apply, no shit Sherlock, normally whatever country you end the loss of that country apply,
whatever, so anyway, agree, and it runs stuff, and it tells you what's going on,
what is connected to where, Apple Mobile Device Service XE 1520, all that 1520s,
possibly a process number I'm not quite sure, sure if I actually bothered to read the help it would
tell me, protocol, TCP, local address, this machine name, 27015, that'll be the
port number, local, host 4409 is the remote address, it was looping back on itself for some weird
reason, Google, two-mile net fire is going to Google, fun, they're not, iTunes helper,
all right, okay, the Apple Mobile Device Service XE is connected to it, the iTunes helper,
which is connected back to the Apple Mobile Device Service XE programs, because that's going from
4409 to 27015, so that's what that's doing, LSASS is listening on a couple of ports, but
no actual connections, SV host is doing stuff, systems doing stuff, seems to have net fire
running, not good, but anyway, it's got stuff running, basically if you've got spyware running
on your machine, chances are it's going to try and connect out to the internet, your
TCP view, you will see it, for example, if I try and pretend that something, hey, let's use
internet explorer, that'll be love, always is, internet explorer, we've run that, all right,
so forget Microsoft.com and go back to TCP view, we now see pretty light red greens, greens are
a connection just made, red is one, just ending, we can see internet explorer is going to lots of places,
it is going to a camay.com, it is going to a specific IP address, it is doing lots of things,
it's interesting because I've got an option to resolve, and it's not resolving them,
but it's got lots of connections, it's gone to 777.677.126.50, which I bet will be the Microsoft
website, Microsoft.com, but you can see exactly what's going on, where and what programming is running,
which is pretty cool for checking spyware and stuff, because you can actually see what an
earth it is going, and it shows you things as they're opening, closing, so that is basically the main
tools, except for PS tools, PS exec, so if I run PS exec, it gives me a lot of options,
so I can run, I can separate the processor, so for example to run the application on CPU,
2 and CPU, 4N2-A2.4, I'm just going to run some stuff, PS exec, now to pad XC,
we run that, and let pad kicks in, wow, exciting, it's cool, as I said before, you can run stuff for
other people's computers, and you can actually look at stuff, and you can copy files over,
and you can actually run stuff, and optional user ID, and password, and timeout, and limited users,
and a billion other options, trust me, it really is a cool application, just go down, look at it,
and see what is going on, PS exec, backstarts, backstarts, compute name, or computer, computer,
computer3, and all that, follow name, dashu, for user, dashp, password, dashm, for timeout,
dashs, for running the remote process and system accounts, but it's really cool, you can set the
priorities up, and run everything, and you can put the computer in there, so you can run stuff
on the computers, that's pretty cool, so if, for example, you sent someone an email with an
attached executable, you can put PS exec in to run the program, and you can get it to run under,
this is an account, don't ask me why that might be useful, but someone might find that useful,
and if you do, you're an asshole, and deserve to die, obviously, of course, if you're emailing
them, so please, would you mind running this, that's fine, if you're not asking them to run out,
and making them run it automatically, then you're an asshole, deserve to die, in a slow and
painful death, what else we got here, PS file, run PS file, it says no files open remotely,
that's good, no one's hacking into the vice computer, at least not at the moment,
again, you can see what files are open, remotely, funnily enough, again, if you find there are
files that remotely, it's a possibility that that is an hack attempt, or something similar, so
if something you want to investigate a little further, PS info is trying to access the internet
querying information, and here we go, PS info, it goes off and says it has been running for six
hours and 15 minutes and 20 seconds, it's a Microsoft Windows XP Uniprocessor free kernel version,
product type, product version service, page two, for example, status, error reading status,
figures, internet explorer version seven system routes, windows, processes one,
process speed 2.7, gigahertz, it's a cellar on CPU, 230, it make memory, and a GeForce 4MX 440 SE
video driver, now you may find that useful to find information out about the computer that you're
connecting to, the uptime is probably the most useful, PS kill, it's possibly my most favorite one,
along with PS exec for just screwing around with people, again, allows you to kill stuff on
other people's computers, you're on PS kill, dash T to kill the process and any descendants,
backslash, backslash and then the computer name, with a dash U for use name, dash P for password,
should it be required, and the process ID or the name, process ID can find by running PS list
on the computer itself, which is the next one, PS list gives you a list of all the stuff running,
system is process ID of 4, priority of 8, all that good stuff, remember I was talking about
priorities earlier, you can see the priorities here, most of them are 8, windlogging is 13,
CSRSS 13's, SMSS is 11, still has too many S's in it, you can see exactly what's going on,
PS list will show that and then you can use PS kill to kill any of them, or you can just give it
specifically by name, which you can again pick from the PS list, PS logged on, again pretty similar
to before, tells me that lots of people are actually logged in, but no one is logged in via resource
shares, which is always good, because that chance time means remotely, that would be the
camera, the names of them, the weird computer dollar files and things that are other shares that
works off demands you put in, but doesn't tell you about, and hides them, PS service,
spam the screen entirely, because you list of all these things like WZ, CSVC for the wireless
zero configuration service, would be presumably the SVC, but tells you who started to look what the
state is, stopped funnily enough, it's hardwired in, not wireless, can't be asked with all the
security settings on there, but you can see exactly what's running, what's stopped, and you can actually
start and stop things yourself, if you want, again, on a backslash, backslash, computer name,
dashu for username, dashp for password, then you run the command, if you've got query, config, set
config, start, stop, restart, pause, cont, depend, find security, that can be pretty cool, if you're
trying to run stuff on a remote computer that you really can't be bothered to walk down eight flights
steps and go through the locked door, swipe your card eight times to set up, you can just do it all
remotely, and I think that's about it, that's all the PS tools, that's all the rest of it,
I'm now going to go and work out what an earth the dollar extent and dollar directory
files are, and why they're floating around on my waste computer, I'm sure a quick google wouldn't
like to me on that, I'd like to thank everyone for their feedback, well actually I'm recording
this on the day that the last episode came out, so only two people have actually told me about
how the last one went over, Dave Yates, because I sent him an early version said,
it Dave, let's do this and see what it's like, he came back said, it's great, you're in
natural, and then Dan listened to it, and did love the reference to himself, so hey Dan,
and he enjoyed it, but did complain it was far too midday centuries, so now I've just spent the
last however long it is, because I don't know, I'm running multiple channels and audacity,
so I keep changing and recording bits, because you really don't want me to rumruke it,
I'm going to do this and it doesn't work, so thank you very much, shout out to Dan and Dave,
