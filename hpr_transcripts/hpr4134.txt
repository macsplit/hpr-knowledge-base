Before we start, I'd just like to give a warning.
This episode contains adult themes and therefore parental discretion is advised.
Hi everybody, this is Ken Fallon with a special show to remember fellow podcaster, host
of the Open Metalcast, Craig Maloney, who passed away on the 2nd of April 2024.
I knew Craig through his work on the Open Metalcast, which was a member of the free culture
podcast.org website, Creative Commons initiative to get various different podcasters together
and he was very supportive of that work because we had Open Metalcast on the list, I was
able to bring in a lot of people who were interested in metal, but not necessarily in
free culture and introduced them to the concept of what the Creative Commons was for free
culture licenses were.
I was aware that he was battling cancer, but it still came as a bit of a shock when I
saw that post, goodbye to Craig Maloney on David Revoys, Pepper Encourage blog, a contacted
David and with his permission I'm going to read you his blog post.
Goodbye Craig Maloney published on the 2nd of April 2024, I'm devastated, I learned
a few hours ago that Craig Maloney aka C Maloney passed away this morning.
Craig had joined the Pepper Encourage project in its early days, almost 10 years ago.
We immediately clicked his passion for metal, for retro video games, for creation for free
Libra and open source projects and communities are much more.
He was involved in testing, reviewing and foolproofing the beta versions of each episode under
construction, with pertinence and precision.
On several occasions he even saved some rather dull story I wrote, becoming the script
doctor for the episodes.
He knew the series' universe, the internal logic so well that he became an efficient
maintainer and writer of the Peckbar and Carrot Wiki and had Pepper Encourage role playing
game project.
He also helped with the translation proofreading my front plays and even managed last year's
April first blog post.
I had absolute trust in Craig.
He was one of the few maintainers to have all the project keys and privileges.
His moral compass was invaluable for his project and helped us through our moments of community
storm analysis.
He was the architect of our code of conduct, which he authored in a particular way by gathering
and synthesizing the opinions of the contributors.
He was one of the two gatekeepers who could kick me out of the project if I crossed the
line.
With these words I hope to make you realize the massive impact Craig had on Pepper and
Carrot, visible on every floor of the series' credits.
He will leave a huge void behind him.
And not only here, but for the many projects he was involved with.
He made the internet a better place.
My thoughts and condolences go out to his wife and family.
Those who want to talk about it are welcome on our InstaChash or in the comments.
And I'll hope he'll excuse me violating the cold of conduct by the end of this.
But fuck cancer, I'll miss you Craig.
Our owner, Hookah, would like to say a few words now.
Hello, this is Hookah for Hacker Public Radio and doing something a little bit different
this time.
I recently lost a friend, a gentleman named Craig Maloney.
I have known Craig for a number of years in a variety of different circumstances.
He was the Ubuntu state of Michigan liaison for a number of years.
There's probably a specific name for that that I don't remember anymore.
I would always see him at Pengwakan.
Craig gave me my first Fediverse account, a master on account which I still use.
Craig was just someone that, you know, when you needed something, he was there.
He organized something called the Michigan users group and kept that going.
He's just involved in a lot of things and I always felt like it was great whenever I saw
him and his wife, Jody, and I'm very sad that he's not going to be with us anymore.
So thank you.
Bye.
Thanks, Hookah.
I would also like to pass on my condolences to Craig's family and friends at this time.
I regret not having had the opportunity like a hookah did to get me to Craig in person
and actually get to know more about the various different projects he was involved with
because he would be somebody that I would have liked to know more in person.
It's only after David linked to his blog post that I realized how much other communities
Craig was involved with, as well as been a family man.
He enjoyed playing drums, making music, juggling, playing with retrocomputers, designing games
and reading, collected old computers, and of course, documented his fight with cancer.
But he also was author of the Medioch or programmer book for beginning programmers and more advanced
programmers.
Designed games, he was the host of the local cast about who went to Empython, who was on
the board of the Michigan user groups, his co-founder and host of the Royal Oak Coffeehouse
Cauldron's group, where pepper and carrots, he maintained toot stream a command line
client for a master one.
But to me, Craig will always be the host of the open metal cast.
So therefore, I think it's only fitting that we end this last episode, open metal cast
episode 192, shovels doesn't, over to you Craig.
Welcome back to Open Metal Cast, bringing you the best and creative commons license
metal music.
My name is Craig Maloney, and in this episode, I decided to take the entire open metal
cast library for a ride.
I'm going to try and get back into a regular schedule of shows, so I threw the whole library
into shuffle mode.
We'll see what falls out on the other end.

Everything you're time to spend
Every way
To something that you might find
One that's feelings
Expectations
Those that's feelings
The time of shot and stupid lies
Now you say
You understand
Everything
Everything that's down for sale
Same in monsters
Fits from your pathetic faith
Your terrors deep inside
Losing every dream
Going to see
L it's all time you say
It's down from you
Anything
God will fall away
And then you'll understand
There's no time to waste your time
Come at us
Charge inside your sales
Reaching tops
Meaning you'll fall from sky
Winters
Summers
Tension
Freedom
Solid
Realers
Close the dust
You have died
Now you say
L it's all time you say
It's down from you
Anything
Now the clock has stopped
And this time you'll understand
There's no time to waste your time
Come at us

We're left behind on the sides
They are like windows to me
We're in a yellow mind
That's exactly these walls
Are they up in the walls
They're all working well
They'll break your mind
Not a part-time
What do you dream of when you'll find this narrow life
The wickedness is beginning
The sharpest eyes
You've got to shake them
They've got you in their sight
The pain is still there
No one is safe tonight
I'm a bunch of children
Oh, for the day day
So there is no way
To know so many things
Are they up in the walls
They're all working well
They'll break your mind
Not a part-time
What do you dream of when you'll find this narrow life
The wickedness is beginning
The sharpest eyes
You've got to shake them
They've got you in their sight
The pain is still there
No one is safe tonight
Oh, for the day day
What do you dream of when you'll find this narrow life
The wickedness is beginning
