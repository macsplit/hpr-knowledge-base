This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3,724 for Thursday the 10th of November 2022.
Today's show is entitled My Top Android Apps.
It is hosted by Archer 72 and is about 10 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is I walk through the top apps on my phone.
Good morning, this is Archer 72, welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
This episode I'm sitting in the parking lot and I just...
It's since I have an Android phone.
I might show some of the apps that I am using on it.
First of all, I'm using the AIO launcher.
And it looks a lot different than some of the other ones that come standard.
As frequent apps, notifications in my apps, which can be expanded, and then there's a dialer.
And I have a place to throw a player, which is recording right now.
So my top apps are QSMS, which is open source, I believe.
See, let's go to Help and Feedback.
No, that's not it.
Discard.
Now I don't see it.
Settings, oh, here we go.
About QSMS.
It is on GitHub, so it is, let's see if you can do the source.
It's under the GNU general public license version 3.0.
So that's that one, NNAs, mobile Firefox, fiber, revolty, antenna pod,
turmox, and
QGGU routes.
Oh, and I use Tuskegee.
And there's nothing in the notifications.
And then for my email, which I don't know if I should be using it on a phone, but I do.
I have canine mail and Google photos, which is not synced.
I have that turned off.
I've been using Amazon photos instead to sync to the cloud.
And then I have elements, the top row, and Tuskegee is still there.
I still use Facebook Messenger,
or just to contact friends and family.
One of my other favorite things to use is Explore X-PO.
Anyways, I'll put it.
The app is Explore, and it's a dual-paying file manager.
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
And then what I'm recording on is just audio recording from GILAB.
Oh, yeah, I still have Instagram on there.
The ebook reader.
The ebook reader is Libraera, under the GPL version 3.0.
And it has options.
Oh, yeah.
And I can read PDF, deja vu, FB2, MOBI, EPUB, XPS, DocX, RTF, ODT, CBZ, ZIP, HTML,
archives, and other, including CHM, I don't recall if that is.
The top bucks I have in here.
I don't know what's an older book.
Star Wars, New Jedi Order, Dark Tide, Onslot.
It's one of them.
And one I'm meaning to read is Boba Fett, a practical man.
In that, also in that series.
Okay, so I'm going out of the ebook reader.
I have multiplayer.
And, instead, as many as you want.
And I don't know what...
That's just in the play store.
It's not under a license or anything.
I used proton mail.
I just started using bit warden.
And I have one task under task here that turns on the hotspot.
And I get into the car and turn on Bluetooth.
And then there's a mobile provider.
And kitty connects.
And then the afteroid and drop air.
And then underneath the myabs, there's, and you can clap that.
And then there's a dialer.
We also go to your contacts or SMS from that page that those three icons.
And nice thing about this...
This nice thing about this launcher is you can attach some actions to the magnifying glass.
And if you tap and swipe off, it goes to the camera.
That's what I have a set to.
And then you can swipe left on that.
And I also have kitty connect on there.
The audio recorder.
Clear scanner.
And that I believe also, let me see the about.
It is quite a few open source libraries and some of them are BSD license.
Somewhere Apache version 2.0.
It's more MIT license.
And unfortunately there is one that has
Fresco and Image Management Library.
It's held by Facebook, but they license it under the BSD license.
And then if you swipe from the left out,
it's got my Amazon photos.
I used Brave once in a while.
There's a feature on that that I like where you can play videos in the background.
You have to go into them.
Let me see, I'll go into it and find out.
Okay, so go to Settings.
You can change your search engine.
Okay, you have to scroll down a little bit.
But it's under Past Downloads.
There's a background video playback.
It says experimental plays audio from video and background.
When tab is not active or device screen is turned off.
Try to switch to desktop mode if this feature is not working.
That's that.
And I have...
Yeah, since I got started in looking into Ham Radio and got my license,
I have an app for the Ham bands to see which I'm able to transmit on.
There was a Ham study that I was using.
The study for that, the Braille, again, MPV player.
Occasionally use Opera.
Nice thing about that is it has a...
I think about Opera as it has a built-in QR code scanner.
PDF Viewer Plus.
Another one I have on the side.
Occasionally I go to Reddit, so I have that installed.
Trying out Signal.
And that is about it.
That's all I have for my apps.
