This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 34124 Tuesday, 31 August 2021.
Tids Show is entitled, Reading a License, Creative Commons Attribution Shary Like 3.0 Unported.
It is hosted by CLAC and is about 35 minutes long and carries a clean flag.
The summary is, we are using this license, but we didn't publish it on HPR.
Until now, Tids Show is licensed under a CC by License.

Hi, I'm Klack√©. Unless otherwise stated, any HPR show is released under a Creative Commons
Attribution Shary Like 3.0 Unported License.
For this show, I'm going to state that it is released under a Creative Commons
Attribution 3.0 Unported License and I'm going to get back to why that is.
So, we have all these shows under this license, but we don't actually have the license
in the preferred format for HPR listeners, which is an HPR show.
So, this show is going to provide that. I'm going to read this license that we are using for
most of our shows. There's a direct trigger for this, of course, and that's because I recorded
the show HPR 3402, which I put under a Creative Commons Attribution Shary Like 4.0 International
License because the source material had this license. So, we were talking about this and then
can ask, so is this better? Should HPR upgrade to this newer license? So, I figure to answer
that question, I will have one show where I read the existing 3.0 license and I'll have one show
where I read the new from 2013 4.0 license and then I'll have one show where I refer back to
those as source material and compare and contrast and also address some things like
license compatibility and how you can upgrade between licenses and so on.
So, just briefly about the 3.0, it was released in February 2007 and an interesting question that comes
up when you are going to perform a license like I'm going to do now is so what license is the
license under. If you look at the new licenses, they are all under a license that says you can
reproduce this verbatim but you cannot alter anything. So, I try to find out what is the license
for the Creative Commons licenses and as far as I can tell, they are under the license of the website
they are published on Creative Commons.org and if I look back in February 2007 when the 3.0
license was launched, the site says except where otherwise noted content on this site is licensed
under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license. So, I assume that the license is under this license
and the Attribution license gives me the right to do basically what I want with the material
as long as I attribute the original author but as a courtesy to the original author,
this episode is under the same license as the source material. The author is the Creative
Commons and this performance, well it's obviously not the same as the source material,
this is a performance, it's an audio format of the license and it's going to be slightly modified
because I'm going to read from the website but I might throw in some commentary here and there.
One thing I discovered when studying the license is that any modifications should be noted as
modifications is not said that it needs to be very strict, you basically need to say that I have
modified this, that's enough but there you go. So, let's go to the actual license and the license is
producing two different formats you could say. One is the actual real license, the legal text
and then they also provide what they call the Creative Commons deed which is the human readable,
they call the other one the legal code and then you have the Creative Commons deed which is the
human readable form of the license which is a sort of summary of what the license is about.
So, here's the Creative Commons deed.
Attribution share like 3.0 unported or short CC by a say 3.0. This is a human readable summary of
and not a substitute for the license and that's a link to the legal code which I will read later
and then there's a clickable pop-up disclaimer and the disclaimer says
this deed highlights only some of the key features and terms of the actual license.
It is not a license and has no legal value. You should carefully review all of the terms and
conditions of the actual license before using the license material. Creative Commons is not a law
firm and does not provide legal services, distributing, displaying or linking to this deed or
the license that it summarizes does not create a lawyer, client or any other relationship
and here comes the actual deed. You are free to share, copy and redistribute the material
in any medium or format, adapt, remix, transform and build upon the material for any purpose even
commercially. The licenseer cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.
Under the following terms, attribution, you must give appropriate credit and there's a link
there to what appropriate credit means. Provide a link to the license and indicate if changes
were made and that's also a link. You may do so in any reasonable manner but not in any way that
suggests the licenseer endorses you or your use. Next term, share a like. If you remix, transform
or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license. That's also
a link as the original. Next term, no additional restrictions. You may not apply legal terms or
technological measures. That's a link that legally restrict others from doing anything the license
permits. And then there are notices. I believe those are part of the deed proper. You do not have to
comply with the license for elements of the material in the public domain or where your use is
permitted by an applicable exception or limitation. Exception or limitation is a link. No warranties
are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use.
For example, other rights such as, and here comes a link, publicity, privacy, or moral rights
and link, may limit how you use the material. So that was the deed, the human understandable
readable summary of the license. And here comes the license proper. There's some text before and
after. And I believe those are not part of the license itself, but I'm going to read those as well.
So here comes first the paragraph before the license starts. Creative Commons Corporation is not
a law firm and does not provide legal services. Distribution of this license does not create an
attorney-client relationship. Creative Commons provides this information on an ASS basis. Creative
Commons makes no warranties regarding the information provided and disclaims liability for damages
resulting from its use. And here comes the license license. The work, as defined below,

perform, you may not offer or impose any terms of the work that restrict the terms of this license
or the ability of the recipient of the work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient

B. You may distribute or publicly perform an adaptation only under the terms of, 1. This
license, 2. A later version of this license with the same license elements as this license,
3. A creative commons jurisdiction license, either this or later license version, that
contains the same license elements as this license. For example, attribution share
like 3.0 U.S. 4. A creative commons compatible license.
If you license the adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in 4, you must comply
with the terms of that license. If you license the adaptation under the terms of any of the
licenses mentioned in 1, 2 or 3, the applicable license. You must comply with the terms of
the applicable license generally, and the following provisions.
1. You must include a copy of or the URI for the applicable license with every copy of
each adaptation you distribute or publicly perform.
2. You may not offer or impose any terms of the adaptation that restricted terms of the
applicable license or the ability of the recipient of the adaptation to exercise the rights granted
to that recipient under the terms of the applicable license.
3. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the applicable license and to the disclaimer
of warranties with every copy of the work as included in the adaptation you distribute
or publicly perform.
4. When you distribute or publicly perform the adaptation, you may not impose any effective
technological measures on the adaptation that restrict the ability of the adaptation from
you to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the applicable
license. This section 4b applies to the adaptation as incorporated in a collection, but this does
not require the collection apart from the adaptation itself to be made subject to the
terms of the applicable license.
4. See, if you distribute or publicly perform the work or any adaptations or collections,
you must, unless a request has been made pursuant to section 4a, keep intact all copyright
notices for the work and provide reasonable to the medium or means you are utilizing.
1. The name of the original author or pseudonym if applicable, if supplied, and or if the original
author and or licensor designate another party or parties, for example, a sponsor institute
publishing entity journal for attribution, attribution parties. In licensor's copyright notice,
the name of such party or parties, 2. The title of the work if supplied, 3. To the extent

the work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the work, and 4. Consistent with section 3b, in the case of an adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the work in the adaptation, for example, French translation of the work
by original author or screenplay based on original work by original author.
The credit required by this section 4c may be implemented in any reasonable manner, provided
however, that in the case of an adaptation or collection, at a minimum, such credit
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the adaptation or collection appears,
then as part of these credits, and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, you may only use the credit required
by this section for the purpose of attribution in the manners that out above, and by exercising
your rights under this license, you may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
any connection with sponsorship or endorsement by the original author, licensor, and or attribution
parties as appropriate of you or your use of the work, without the separate express prior
written permission of the original author, licensor, and or attribution parties.

by applicable law, if you reproduce, distribute, or publicly perform the work either by itself
or as part of any adaptations or collections, you must not distort, mutilate, modify, or
take other derogatory action in relation to the work, which would be prejudicial to the
original author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions,
for example Japan, in which any exercise of the right granted in section 3B of this license,
the right to make adaptation, would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification
or other derogatory action prejudicial to the original author's honor and reputation,
the licensor will waive or not assert as appropriate this section to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable national law, to enable you to reasonably exercise your rights under
section 3B of this license, right to make adaptations, but not otherwise.

not apply to you. 6. Limitational liability Except to the extent required by
applicable law, in no event will licensor be liable to you on any legal theory for any
special, incidental, consequential punitive or exemplary damages arising out of this
license or the use of the work, even if licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. 7. Termination A. This license and the rights granted

the mutual written agreement of the licensor and you.
F. The rights granted under and the subject matter referenced in this license were drafted
utilizing the terminology of the burn convention for the protection of literary and artistic
works as amended on September 28th, 1979. The Rome Convention of 1961.
The WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996. The WIPO performances and phonograms treaty of 1996.
And the Universal Copyright Convention as revised on July 24th, 1971.
These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the license
terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation
of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
rights not granted under this license, such additional rights are deemed to be included
in the license. This license is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
applicable law. That's the end of the license proper and after comes a notice.
