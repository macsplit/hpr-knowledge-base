This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3677 for Tuesday the 6th of September 2022.
Today's show is entitled Hacker Public Radio 2021-2022 New Years Show Part 4.
It is hosted by Hum Kimagoo, and is about 194 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag. The summary is, the HPR community comes together to chat.
Ooh, how nice is it there with me? It's a half a half four.
Right now, it's 8.15 PM.
8.15 PM.
Is that evening or morning?
It's 8.30 PM, so that's evening.
Yeah, it's 8.30 PM, Joe.
I'm standing over here trying to move heavy things, looking at the time on my computer.
Yeah, it's 3.37, so yeah, if we want to be completely accurate.
It's 9.37 PM here, 21.37.
And my watch says it's like a...
Third signal, but it's not accurate.
It's a bit in front of the actual time.
It's 6.37 PM here in California, and I'm definitely not going to make it to midnight.
Yeah, I don't think I've made it past midnight.
Josh, you always sound like you're about to fall asleep.
I think that's a truth.
That's the joys of apnea.
Indeed.
If you want some tips on how to stay awake, I have lost them.
Well, a couple of them.
First off, fork a lot, because thing you won't feel thirsty, hungry or tired,
which is the one I'm employing right now.
I've got a second spot.
I figured you were going to say either high doses of caffeine or lots and lots of that.
In California, definitely be the math.
Well, the whole problem with New Year's Eve is staying awake and drinking,
and drinking is not conducive to staying awake.
At the present time, you do.
Guilty was charged.
Another way, like caffeinated gummies.
To discount all the caffeinated stuff, because we know caffeine works, right?
But it works only short-term.
Long-term, it's not that great, and then you need to ingest a loss of caffeine,
just to get it through the night.
This is something which has relatively little impacts apart from the fact
that you're staying up all night.
Let me tell you.
As you get older, it's actually easier to do it all nighter.
The problem is, is you're paying for it a lot longer.
Yep.
Truth.
Probably.
Yeah.
It's not that hard for me, actually, right now,
because I've got a couple of them already.
It's just that you need to know the trick.
I said talking already, but there is another way,
and that does have a greater risk of falling asleep.
But that depends on what you're watching.
If you're watching something action-filled,
an action-filled can literally just be gala-fant.
The first time I did stay up all nighter
was when I was watching gala-fans,
and gala-fans isn't the most scary thing.
There's a lot of singing, but it has action,
and there has some stakes.
And I was watching it for the first time,
and I thought it was pretty cool.
I found the easiest way to stay up all night,
and not realize you've stayed up all night,
is to have a really, really large book
that's actually interesting.
Yeah.
But if you have something that's actually interesting,
for instance, the first time I tried watching time team,
absolutely riveting thing,
it's about archaeology and stuff, and it's really cool.
But I've nearly fell asleep,
so I changed it to stuff.
Now I've got the bad batch right up there.
Yeah.
I've got some troubles with Star Wars Rebels season two.
Yeah.
But I've just got the rebels up there.
No, rebels, I've got a bad batch up there,
so I should probably turn off,
but I'm busy talking.
Shneaking turned off.
So what's off?
The headphones, Bluetooth headphones,
a keyboard, and just the screen.
Just turn everything off.
Oh, apparently.
Yeah, up there.
It's great, you're not ready to.
Yeah.
And debating if I should still go to bed or an office 24.
No, you shouldn't go to bed anymore.
It's too late.
No.
You should just turn it off, or you could watch it.
That's another option,
but then you should also watch the Clone Wars,
which like, that would also make you stay up.
It's ready to turn itself off.
Okay, great.
Yeah.
Because I was actually just watching it,
but then I was like, you know,
I'll have a quick chat and maybe come back later.
And then I didn't.
And yeah.
But I, from what I've seen of the bad batch so far,
I quite like it.
And I've seen the whole Clone Wars,
and I quite like it.
Does anyone have any,
does anyone like Star Wars here as well?
Well, I'd prefer to watch the Mandalorian.
Well, I already watched the Mandalorian.
Oh, the book above the edit is out now too.
The first episodes out.
Yeah.
We watched it.
Yeah.
I haven't watched it last night.
We watched it last night.
It was confusing.
I'd be, but you know,
it might not be if I've watched a loss of explanation videos
on a lot of things.
Maybe it's not confusing if you watched it in time.
Are you doing three different time periods
and bouncing back and forth?
And you have to keep figuring out
which time periods they're in right now.
Ah.
And, and how,
look at how old Boba is.
Well,
like Clone Wars was that also.
Clone Wars,
like first it's not not that bad
because you think it's in the same time frame basically.
And it's kind of the same time frame I think,
but it's like sometimes it just
goes between stuff.
Like if,
like for instance,
if a major character has died,
then we don't go back to see what that major character
did before.
Well, the Star Wars movies
would have been a lot more interesting
if he'd have let the actors know what they were doing
because they didn't get a chance to really do any acting
because they were just doing a scene
and doing another scene
and doing a different scene.
He didn't have him in order.
He didn't have anyone know what their motivation was.
You were just supposed to go read the lines.
Which,
which,
which trilogy we're talking about?
We're talking,
four, five, six, and one, two, three.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah.
They're not too bad.
They turn out really well.
That's the,
the,
they could have been better.
They paid all these.
Could have been better.
They paid all these actors so much money to do nothing,
but read your lines
and not know why you're reading them.
Yeah.
Could have been better,
but to be honest,
um,
this might be,
um,
but I think
Anakin was very accurate in the prequel.
That is how someone with zero society,
with like who likes someone,
but who has zero,
like zero,
um,
the social skills,
social skills.
Yeah, social skills.
That's how they would act.
They would,
well,
if,
if from Anakin's,
uh,
like Anakin's surroundings also influenced it,
but like,
because it was accurate,
that doesn't make the movies not suck.
No,
I like the movies.
I like,
the thing is,
I'm younger than Revenge of the Sith.
By a couple months,
same year,
but like,
I'm younger than Revenge of the Sith.
I always had these prequels and stuff.
So,
I might not have known the full plot of it,
like I did with the original trilogy,
because people kept spoiling it,
because they assumed
I'd have watched something from the 80s,
even though,
um,
uh,
I'm nearly old enough.
I hate to tell you this,
but, um,
Star Wars is fairly in the 80s.
Yeah,
I, yeah,
well,
still 80s still.
Well,
I remember seeing episode four first run
before they even called it episode four,
and, uh,
it was just Star Wars.
That's all it was.
And,
you know,
you sit in the front row of that theater,
and here come
the lettering,
and then the ship's going right over your head,
and you're going,
ah,
and that was special,
but they still didn't have any acting worth writing home about.
Wasn't that,
uh,
in the 70s Moss?
Yeah,
late 70s.
Yeah, I think it was 78.
Yeah,
that even pretty,
it's me by a year.
70s.
Pretty me by a couple of years,
but yeah,
kids,
I think the last one.
Yeah.
Well,
I was still in my first marriage,
pretty early in it,
and she was taking her students,
uh,
to go see it,
and I went with them one time.
I,
I literally just watched it,
because my friend kept trying,
kept spoiling it,
like,
all the rounds are going to blow up.
But you see all this stuff going over your head on a big screen,
and it's a whole different thing.
Yeah.
Well,
I sure,
did anyone bother with the,
uh, new matrix,
by the way?
I watched,
I didn't even watch the original matrix.
No,
no,
I watched movies.
No one talks about,
but not the movie saying anyone actually talks about.
That's why I watched all MCU in the summer,
which by the way,
took me a long time,
because I did watch
from 2008 to nowadays.
There's,
all the movies,
every single one.
I don't,
I don't know if it's this way in other countries,
but like,
the MCU is like,
I swear to God,
like 90% of what's in theaters now.
I actually like those movies,
but like,
that in headaches
are why I stopped going to theater.
But I did actually see the latest matrix,
because the company I worked for just basically,
at least where I was,
say, hey,
whoever, you know,
we're just going to run out,
this like tiny nonprofit theater,
and whoever,
it out.
What's Irish TV Show?!
I have..
I know is father Ted,
and I love it.
And apparently,
it's only from the news,
which like,
it could be from any period.
It's like,
the technology kind of
so I don't know. I have trouble placing it. What?
Making me feel old here, man.
Well, maybe I feel sometimes, and I am only...
I'm less than two decades old, so...
Yeah, when I...
If I feel old, that means that everyone,
everyone in me probably is old.
I usually joke that people,
if they're even second older,
like a sense of me to short,
that they're old or they're short.
It's not funny if they're actually old or short.
It's funny when they're still considered either young
or when they're just...
Well, I'm more than twice your age.
It doesn't stop people making fun of me,
because I'm like five feet,
but I don't get that way over zoom,
but the people meet me and they're like,
holy crap, you're short.
And I was like, yes, thank you.
Yes, you're short.
I think that's more like...
From how you're saying it,
that sounds more like, oh,
I didn't expect you to be that short.
It doesn't actually affect me.
It's just kind of funny.
If you're five foot or below,
I think you legally qualify as a midget
and can apply for disability.
No, it's actually less than four, eight.
I don't know how much it fetus.
Like, D&D uses it.
I'm sorry.
And it's like...
It's fine if everyone were to use it.
It would be fine?
Roughly.
It would be fine if literally
just everyone except never used it.
Then I would be absolutely fine with stuff.
But I...
Well, D&D was created by Gary Gagax
in the 70s.
And I'm pretty sure he was American.
Yes.
But it's now used by people from all over the world.
It can be useful sometimes,
because sometimes you know some specific fact,
but you only know it in metric.
So you can just imagine
that it's the same size,
even though it actually isn't
if you would convert it.
Americans are pretty selfish, you know.
So five feet is 1.5 to 4 meters.
Yeah.
Well, apart from my grievances,
it's not actually that bad
if you just tell me afterwards.
I just have to say that.
Just have to.
That doesn't mean I probably should.
I'm European.
I have been to the European Union
to complain about a non metric stuff.
Yeah.
You said you have to complain about
at least three times a year.
Yeah.
And say that good health care,
the Europe has good health care.
That's also something
you have to say.
It's required.
You guys don't really have good health care,
or that if you do have health care,
the wait times are so long
to get anything done that
will have time while waiting.
And we don't want to talk about the fact
that they take a long time here too.
It just also might bankrupt you.
Yeah, may I point out,
I do actually,
if I think that if I lived in America
if I grew up there,
I don't think
we do have enough money for all this stuff,
which I needed for me
to just function as a normal person.
And I don't have it that hard.
I just have trouble
with my metallurics.
That's it.
Well, I'm sure I have.
I'm just scrappy back,
scrappy metallurics,
and I'm autistic.
That's basically the three main things.
My kids all have,
well, my mental child has different sets of medical issues.
But dyslexia, dysgraphia,
is something to get them.
Proper education is difficult enough.
But my middle child has a tumor
that is right next to her brain on her eye.
She's an optic nerve, essentially.
And MRIs,
at least twice a year,
always with new glasses.
She has multiple chemical sensitivity.
So anything can set off her allergies.
She's required to carry an epipin
everywhere she goes,
along with the slew of medications
that help keep her alive.
And it's okay.
Yeah.
It's extremely difficult to keep ahead
of paying for all of that.
I was talking to a
someone who lived in Kansas
in America and then moved to the Netherlands.
And he actually said,
because we tend to think of America as like the entrepreneur.
He said it was actually easier to freelance
in Europe if for no other reason.
And then you can't get bankrupted
by medical costs.
I had a love group that I was talking with.
And they're all like very American libertarian.
Like they're very like
and they'd actually been to Europe.
And they claimed that Europe sucked basically.
Like they just like to basically
whine about Europe.
And I told them about that guy.
And they lost their minds.
But I tried to ask them.
I was like, okay, well, how would we do it here?
Like let's assume yes to Europe's speed.
Europe sucks.
But then so does America.
So how can we do it?
There's like a lot of my peers really want.
Like the single pair health care system right now,
which I don't think is realistic.
And it doesn't.
But like here, I think we just don't want to admit that we've like
done it wrong for a really long time.
No, there's so much money involved with our
with our health care system.
I mean, we pay.
I cost than any other country that I'm aware of.
Even with insurance.
We pay those higher costs.
And we're paying insurance on top of that.
There's a lot of people making a lot of money off of us
doing the way things are done now, which is why we're doing it.
And they're influencing your government,
which is why you'll never have change.
Yeah, exactly.
This thing, that's why every,
that's why in every argument on the internet,
people from Europe always give that thing.
Because we think it's just such a basic fact of life
that you, if you have something like,
if you have someone who has a tumor,
like that's something the government has to pay for.
That's not something you can pay for yourself.
That's something which happened
and isn't your fault.
Communism is what we would call it here.
Socialism is the worst.
Yeah.
The thing has been fine.
Communism or socialism, they'll never tell you.
The thing with the American,
is that we are like raised from the ground up.
Even if we're kind of on the more liberal or progressive side,
we are raised from the ground up to be incredibly distrustful in the government.
And we're very big on like self-reliance.
I think it's carryover from kind of like the pioneers,
men kind of mentality.
And I will admit that sometimes when I talk to other Europeans,
I find myself also having a little bit of it.
But I at least can kind of step back and say,
okay, you know, here's what I'm used to.
But here's maybe the best way.
I tend to agree with actually a lot of other Americans on like,
like I think the government is good at certain things,
but not a lot of other things.
But healthcare is the one where I'm like,
yeah, no, that probably.
I definitely would trust it more to the government than companies.
Because I think what a lot of Americans hear this,
or at least the more conservative ones,
is that like it's right now,
companies controlling a lot of things.
Yeah.
And they really don't care.
Like, you can argue that they're coming in,
they're basically saying,
they're companies don't care.
But companies are worse.
Yeah, they just basically come up with a government here.
Like, they run the government,
and they have a health care.
So, we complain about the entire insurance system,
because, well, it sucks.
And, but then they want to also complain about,
you know, a government run system,
because that's socialism or communism.
Exactly.
But regular insurance is groups of people
paying against a possibility,
and they're paying small amounts over a long period of time.
And those small amounts end up going to,
well, profit mostly.
But a large chunk of that goes to one or two individuals
who get really sick.
But that's the exact same idea behind the
socialistic medicine, the socialized medicine.
Yes, excuse me.
Excuse me.
We missed an hour here.
Can you hear me?
Yes, we can hear you.
So, I use that to mess with people on LinkedIn all the time.
There was a guy that was like,
because the big thing here is we don't like redistribution of wealth.
Like, that's a big kind of trigger here for a lot of Americans.
And so, big, some guy was going on LinkedIn
about redistribution of the other.
And I was like, well, what do you think about insurance?
And he actually didn't like insurance either,
which at least he was consistent.
I'll give him credit for that.
But I use that to mess with them.
I was like, okay, so we don't want redistribution of wealth.
We hate taxes, we hate.
So, how do you feel about insurance?
And they just think it's so mad at me.
It's so funny.
But we have a lot of people moving around.
It all goes on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A medical market to normalize to where people could actually afford it.
I agree.
Yeah.
Anyhow, I wanted to interrupt.
We did miss the 10 o'clock every time.
Somebody, maybe they're in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,
just passed into the New Year five minutes ago.
Yay.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
I also wanted to say, Joe, I can make you feel young.
When I was in junior high,
they published the second paperback edition,
which is the first authorized edition of Lord of the Rings.
And they were 95 cents a book.
Okay.
Okay.
That was a long time ago.
You win.
That's very long ago.
Like, Lord of the Rings movie was long ago.
Oh, shut up.
Lord of the Rings movie was like waiting for that.
I've only read the books, though.
Well, the book sucked.
But the movie sucked.
The books are great and amazing.
The second book, the two hours,
that book is perfect.
If you have a severe case of insomnia
and you want to pass out by the end of the first chapter.
He goes very much into description more than any other author.
He does a bit of it than any other author.
Lord.
I go Lord.
Go Lord.
I love the Hobbit.
He's talking's best book.
But I completely disagree and so do his kids.
He wrote that for his kids and they hated it.
I liked it.
I read a Hobbit like several times.
My dad keeps trying to get me to read the rest of Lord of the Rings.
I was just like, no.
Some people say our time completely different works.
I hated the Hobbit and I fell in love with Lord of the Rings
and read it 20 times before I was out of high school.
The Wheel of Time series, probably 20 times now, maybe 25.
I've heard a lot of the Wheel of Time.
I've heard a lot of it read it but I'm watching the series.
I've never heard about Wheel of Time actually anywhere.
I've heard it from one channel on YouTube and from you.
That's basically where I heard it from.
Now, the Wheel of Time series that's on Amazon.
I'm sure it's a great series.
I'm watching it and my dad really liked it.
I really wish I could sit down and watch it.
But it's so different, fundamentally different from the books
that it just trips me up when I try to watch it.
Joe, what did you tell me about watching the Resident Evil Show?
You had to let it go.
You had to let the story go and I understand that.
And I tried and I tried when it came to the Wheel of Time on Amazon.
Yeah, I had similar experience with a version of the thing from Terry Pratchett.
So, like you've...
Yeah, and Pratchett actually authorized that.
Was it Gards Gards?
No, it was something...
The watch, it was the watch.
I didn't know why I should read them.
It's not the book of the series.
So, there's a series called The Watch.
And I...
Hands on it.
And I had a look at it.
I, and my parents,
really know the books and love the books.
And there, I would suggest reading all 41 of the books.
And then all the other books, he has written.
Because they're all amazing.
Well, apart from...
Just a tip, you don't have to read one and two first.
They are apparently prequels written before the story.
Before the rest of the story.
I didn't know that.
And that's very useful information.
Because he definitely spikes in quality right after those two.
There are a couple books which are very chaotic.
But basically, that series...
Like the opposite.
But I get to that in a second.
Go ahead.
Watch of really good stuff.
They could have just like gone per book or did something.
Like, there are ways of turning the watch...
Like, the watch arc basically of the disc world into a series.
And it was very well.
And Good Omens is a series based off of a book
of Der Prachand and Neil Gaiman.
Good book.
Yeah, good book, good series.
Did you happen to see the movie of the color of magic?
Color of magic, yeah.
That's the first book.
I am talking about the movie.
Well, it's the movie very chaotic.
That's what I'm asking.
Because I haven't seen a movie.
I've read the book and the book was very chaotic.
Well, you should see the movie.
Just for comparison's sake.
I'll have a look if I can see the movie somewhere.
But, yeah.
There's a kind...
Sarah Pratchis really good.
Who do you think I was actually read the books of Der Prachand?
I haven't read all of them.
I probably only read 12 or 14 of them myself.
Yeah, I probably haven't read that many.
I read them all at leery times.
Same.
I'm actually on a kind of diet for the second year now.
Of no Ter Pratchis for me.
Because I read them all.
And then I read them all for a second time.
And then I was like, okay, I have to stop before this isn't fun anymore.
Because after two years of reading it for half a year,
it kind of gets...
You kind of know what's going to happen.
I don't actually want that.
Because I really enjoyed the books.
That's why I read them for a second time.
I got burnt out on the Dresden Files.
Which one?
The Dresden Files.
That's not Pratchis.
Yeah, that's not Pratchis.
But no, the Dresden Files is currently about a 15 book series.
16 book series.
And I know that Moss is reading it.
Because I kind of...
It's going to be 20 when it's done.
According to Wikipedia, there are 41 disc world novels as well as a number of short stories.
Yes.
And I've read the whole 40 books.
And there's a number of other novels other than disc world.
I've read the one about Poo.
I've read the Where's My Cow.
But those are both like stories set within this world.
And I've read a bunch of other books.
He's written, I've read the Johnny saga.
I've read the Bermilliad.
I've read the reboot.
I've read it.
Carpet people.
I've read a couple of short stories from his...
From his earlier career.
Which are like...
There are two books of that.
And I've read those.
Dodgers.
Nation.
The ones I didn't read are like long world and that kind of stuff.
But my dad said they're crap.
And they're really very terrible.
So yeah.
So is there a bunch of books that he hasn't...
That he didn't release before he died?
Sorry, I just came back in.
Well, book 41 was released after his death.
So he was basically...
I don't know for certain...
He...
If you look at the release dates,
he released a book about every year.
He is not Elron Hubbard.
He did not continue writing after his death.
No.
But he did...
I was a little confused because Moss said something about it.
It'd be 21 after it was done or something.
No, no.
Dresden is going to be 20 when he's done.
He'll actually end up being 20 years.
He's going to do 20 books and then a big apocalypse trilogy.
Well, laptop issues.
In fact, I...
Well, I supported one of those small Linux businesses about a year ago.
And...
Nice idea.
Except laptop I got...
had a few problems from beginning really.
And then it got worse,
like my internal sound breaking.
And then I played YouTube, for example.
And then it freezes up sometimes.
It has not done it for a while.
But when I was on the earlier,
just at the end there,
it just all froze up for the most part again.
And then the battery is all stuck inside.
So I have to let it basically
pair off and die.
And then it's okay again.
Well, I think this is not a trick to fix it.
Do you know a trick to fix?
Maybe I don't know.
What disorder are you running?
But it's a button to you,
but it has a PPA.
Where the guys changes a little bit as well.
So you may improve the hardware,
where it does.
What improvements may have been
are what's breaking your machine.
It might be.
It might be that his PPA doesn't work,
as well as...
He said it was fun to do with another PPA joke.
Well, yeah, usually they call it a different...
Another distro though.
Have you checked the wards?
I don't know.
It just makes me sad.
That was probably a separate issue.
Like the YouTube video went crackly.
This is February.
I thought I could send a laptop back,
but I don't want to,
because I will be on lots of Zoom meetings.
It's pandemic.
I've got to use a laptop for kind of things.
I've been on a computer a bit too much.
The last two years,
because of, yeah.
And now it might be okay,
one year warranty has gone.
I've got another guy who fixes laptops
if I was totally stuck.
But it kind of works.
But it doesn't completely work.
And main thing is the internal sound doesn't work.
Since that YouTube video,
it went crackly and it just sort of...
Completely stopped.
And it can freeze up sometimes,
like earlier.
It sort of repeats itself.
Like it might be RAM issue.
RAM inside the laptop that's got a bit loose.
But I don't know.
And then it...
Have you tried...
Have you tried loading a different distro?
Maybe from a USB?
Also, when it powers off,
it's like it's not...
Well, it's not powered off completely.
It's a laminated keyboard.
So like that still lifts up when it does that.
And you can see the power buttons.
But that was it.
I can't do anything until it died.
Right, I'll have a break then.
Now or so later,
which is now...
I'll come back, I guess, if it's working.
It's the laptop.
So is the battery in internal?
Yes.
Well, yes, under a load of screws.
I'm not going to be sitting now and screwing the laptop for that.
Well, if you're wanting to make sure whether it's hardware or software,
it's a RAM stick to them and see the same problem.
Total separate image.
Yeah, that's what I was saying.
Well, that might be worth a try actually,
but I don't know.
I mean, I think my sound issue is probably this actually broken.
But I don't...
Are broken?
If they were crackling,
it's most likely that the speakers themselves are broken.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Because I'm using it now via headset.
That's fine.
I can also stream music.
I'm using it now via headset.
That's fine.
I can also stream music via Bluetooth to a different device I've got.
That works.
But obviously, internal sound.
I can't play any videos or anything and get sound.
So I shouldn't speak as a broken back in February.
It's probably an easy fix.
Hardware-wise.
It sounds like a whole bunch of magic to me.
If you think about it, technology.
What you're talking about right now,
sounds like,
what's your nonsense to me?
I can understand a couple words,
but it's a bit...
It's a bit hard to understand for anyone who isn't actively.
So yeah, I'm a lot like magic.
No, I remember now.
You're not as techy as we...
Yeah.
They're still very surface level on this.
I thought we were just talking about the simple things.
Yes.
Simple things.
I'm doing air quotes.
You can't see it because it's sound.
But I'm doing air quotes.
Simple things.
I understand some words.
I am not completely oblivious to all things technology,
but close, close enough.
Do you believe me?
I understand internal...
Yeah, these internal speakers are probably readily accessible as soon as you open the thing up.
And it's literally going to be a two-prong connector for both of them.
What's the two-prong connectors broken inside?
No, I figured the speakers are blown.
But probably the...
Okay, now we're going to get more complicated.
There's a little tiny copper coil that's like really super long
that runs in the middle of the speaker,
and most likely that is popped somewhere in the middle.
Oh, oh, oh.
They probably have popped,
because I'll tell you what I did as well.
I was telling my tech friend this,
and he said, well,
anyway, it's your fault then.
And I was like, really?
But I've done this on another laptop,
and never had this problem.
So, yeah, I was playing like some metal rock
or something on YouTube, though.
Back in February, right?
Except it didn't come out.
It didn't sound as good on the laptop.
Like it doesn't always do on laptops.
So, I went into the power control, you know, pulse audio,
and I up to sound past 100%,
to about 153%.
And that's...
I've done that on another laptop, no problem.
But this laptop,
it started to crackle,
and then it went.
Yeah, the speakers.
So, you missed...
Let me try...
Let's assume that there are people like me
who might not understand everything technical,
which is totally fine by the way
that you're going to do technical.
So, it's HPR, after all.
It's expected.
But so, what you're saying is,
is that you missed with the thing,
past the limit where you're supposed to mess with it,
and then it broke,
and so it's your fault that it broke
as you missed with the thing you're not supposed to mess with.
Basically...
Well, kind of.
Except...
Except...
I wouldn't completely agree with that, because...
That would do it.
Because what I went into is the sound settings,
and you can up it past 100%,
as in the normal...
It says the sound might get distorted.
It might actually sound better when you do that.
And normally,
a laptop is okay with that.
It depends on the...
The impedance of the speakers.
Which might be the age of the speakers.
It's the thing.
Like, it's not really your fault for doing it.
Unless you're thinking about the configs and changing it.
The thing is...
Yeah, and that's the other thing.
This laptop's supposed to be brand new,
but you're about a year old,
because I bought it.
Then it makes sense.
If you're supposed to be able to mess with the thing,
and even though it might be risky,
and you're supposed to be able to mess with it,
no problem.
And the thing is also new.
Then it makes sense.
Yeah, it's annoying.
It's annoying.
I'll cost about...
I'll see.
Then I'll cost about 500 quid on its own
before I upgrade it slightly.
So I've got more RAM, for example,
and I've got more space on the SSD,
and it'll have like 4GB RAM by default.
So I would...
be able to purchase speakers
for that model,
relatively low cost,
and it should not be hard to replace them.
No, yeah, I'm a bit like...
I can...
do I try and send it back?
I don't really want to do that.
Or I do get to Monica and then fix it now.
But...
Oh, at some stage.
It's just a little bit...
a bit frustrating, though.
I don't know why it does...
might occasionally do that.
And it kind of copies on the menu
that like repeats everything.
It's like in the...
you're all in the address bar, you know,
on the web page.
If I put down the letter A or
type something in, it could repeat that.
And it used to repeat everything
on down the menu on gloom as well.
The important answer is
installing a commit into a app.
Yeah, it doesn't sound like
there's anything wrong with the...
I mean, it sounds like there's something wrong
with operating systems.
Well, the speaker's a blow.
The speaker issue is
probably Sapp Pro.
That's probably me because of
Lever.
Or it's a hardware.
The whole speaker's won't good enough in the first place.
But the other thing...
Well, but you're having...
you're also having like the...
everything that's stuttering and the...
videos freezing, right?
Now, it could technically have been
an update that caused a driver issue
where there's a conflict between the
3.5 millimeter port
and your internal speakers.
And the mouse can freeze sometimes too.
For whatever reason,
like it, yeah.
I mean, it still...
Just install Linux Mint real quick and see what happens.
Why are we saying Mint?
There was just a Mint guy we had on earlier.
I am a Mint guy.
I'm one of the hosts on the Mint care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Any kind you're having problems with
the Mint will pick most of them.
Yes. The answer is almost always
install Mint.
Like it's called a driver's built-in as
well, more so. Or is it just...
Because he likes Mint.
I like Mint.
Almost every mind's running out there
says the same thing.
If your computer isn't working right
on Linux,
reminds me of like,
Indy-Indy, there's this
like, joke thing.
If you're in a troubling situation
and you're a spellcaster,
just cast Fireball.
Nothing is bad happens when you cast Fireball.
And we get this one fixed somehow
or enough so.
But there was not a little slap
as far as looking at it.
Oh, that could be interesting.
Comes out at the end of January as well.
There's Star Labs,
some sort of small UK
one, I think.
They've got like,
they've got some laptops out
already, but they're coming out
with like a 14-inch one
and then also like an 11-inch one
but like a netbook but better.
And it's not...
Yeah, it reads me cheap, I think,
for the price and you can upgrade
that slightly too.
Like, let's change a power port.
It's going to be something.
It's going to be in Dell.
What's that?
It's going to be used Dell.
I have yet to find a Dell laptop
that I couldn't install Linux on.
Oh, Dell.
I already got one for sale in the UK,
but it was like, my friend told us that
the last virtual log meeting
in December, right?
Because we've just got mentioned
and it was about 4,000 pounds
or something stupid.
It's under as being a business laptop
and it's there,
here's in the way kind of thing.
And it was like,
wolf 1,000 tooth
and it was more than a Mac, basically.
And it was like, really?
Oh, it's got a nice
Nvidia graphics card possibly or something,
but it was like, really?
The Dell gaming laptop?
I don't know.
It's totally there still in the way there,
but...
If it's gaming an laptop?
No.
All gaming things
should have...
I've got a lit up keyboard
on this laptop that's nice
and we change the colors and things, yeah.
I haven't got a lit up keyboard,
but a lit up headset
upstairs in my usual setup.
This is my dad setup
which has like open mic thingy
where if I do this,
you might hear it.
I don't hear anything.
Yeah.
I was just touching the mic
something.
And I've had some blue
tooth keyboard
that I bought separately,
USB that were this up in things as well.
I remember seeing one on the plane somewhere once
and I was like, oh, that's looking nice.
I want that.
A keyboard like that and I got one.
Well, I was going to say with Dell
and HP and
I'm going to kind of go
sort of change the subject a bit here,
but it's related to Dell
because somebody mentioned Dell.
I, you know,
Dell, HP, Lenovo,
Acer, Acer,
all of those
and there's maybe more to it.
Now all the big, all those big
laptop computer companies
that, how I see it as this,
HP as well.
How I see it,
I got that too, that's the side point.
But how I see it as this,
all those companies,
they just don't care about Linux.
Not seriously.
Some of them have super computers
or servers with Linux
because that's where the big money is, right?
But for the like,
they don't stop the home users as a consumer,
they couldn't care less.
Good to disagree with you right there.
When it comes to Dell,
because Dell is one of the few companies
in the Linux laptop,
and that's the
Dell XPS 13 developer edition.
Yeah, hang on.
There's a key word, right?
Let's just develop a
addition.
We can break that.
But technically two words,
developer and addition.
Yeah, yeah, but it means, like,
this is a little commercially
released now.
Not, not, not normal people, right?
But you know,
there's a lot of laptops
and especially their tablets
work with Linux.
I have two problems installing
any version of Linux
onto Dell tablet.
Either the venue 11,
take your pick on the model number
or the Dell latitude.
All right, two and one.
Yeah, no, no, fair enough.
However, if I,
I don't need to,
for a laptop,
I'm just a usual person, let's say, right?
Don't really know much about computers.
I know a bit, right?
But I'm looking for a laptop.
I used to have Dell websites
in the PC,
but I didn't say you,
but if you like,
it could be you if you want.
Probably.
Although your dad's into Linux,
so you do have some kind of idea
with Linux,
so looking for laptop,
you go to the Dell website,
HP as well.
They're not going to find a little
laptop. They're going to find
the Windows laptop.
And that's how it is.
I would look for Linux stuff.
I thought you were going in that direction.
You thought I was going into,
yeah, I didn't know.
It's hard to follow a conversation
if you only understand half the words.
It's like if I started
a combination between Dutch and English,
first of all, it'd be very hard
because I'm not in that mindset right now.
But I've been talking English for a couple hours.
Yeah.
Oh, I've seen something in the chat.
Yes, it's a you-nose computer's machine
and one I've got now.
Is it like that got
got us like a
Roman Roman version of
or was the name
camera memory I'm tired.
Probably offended or just now
who knows.
The one that was on earlier.
Yeah, do you know is that
Roman goddess, right?
No, I don't know. There's
Moss has linked to some of the UK Linux companies.
So I said, I said
the machine I'm on now is a
you-nose computer.
Yeah, I think the actual laptop is maybe
comes, comes from
somewhere else in Taiwan.
And I think he buys in
a little something.
But yes, do you know computers this one?
Yeah, yeah.
Clevo, that was it.
Yeah, Clevo, some moss in the chat.
So they get like a Clevo thing
rebranded it or something.
But yeah, do you know computers is what I bought here?
Then there's Entro where obviously
which I know about.
Anyway, that was like old camp sponsors and things.
Just Juno does come from mythology
and it's also
one of the moon
of Saturn.
Yeah, but the moon of Saturn
is named after the goddess.
That's the thing.
Anything astrology where you're like
it's also astrology.
Like it's mythology.
But also astrology.
All the astrology stuff is named
Astro in a mythology.
And there's a book from Spain
yet when I about that as well.
Laptops or Laptops.
or UK.
And there's maybe one more
that we're forgetting or something.
But I don't know.
I'm just here to be annoying
interrupt and to remind you that
there are people out there who might
know what they do, what's going on.
And that's totally fine.
By the way, if I interrupt
like this, just continue talking
except if I want to make a point.
No, no, no, no.
That's fine.
It's a book as well.
It's a point, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's a conversation.
I'm being annoying,
which is what I do in conversations.
I just got tired of being
talking over someone or being
talked over.
So I've just been posting things in the chat.
What you're used to podcast
with an excessive number of hosts.
Anyhow, the other one
as I posted in chat is
a lot of work to them.
They don't just get the machine
and put their brand on it.
The biggest thing is
apparently there's a problem
with some of the Wi-Fi
modules in them.
And they have to completely
replace those.
And that's usually a nice soldering job.
A lot of companies take cleavows
and then just rebrand them.
The Wi-Fi works on this laptop
but it seems
if anyone ever has trouble
with me talking too much
just do the exact same.
I wouldn't advise
anyone to do this with anyone
else but me.
But do the exact same as I do.
I will usually
if we're talking over each other
and it can't over power
though the person.
Let the person speak
and then tell my thing later on.
Especially if I'm talking
that's why I do sometimes
too.
Now I'm just talking about
Salvador.
Or you sometimes want to go
back on something because
there's a need to be just a subject
to you guys.
I want to make a point
for at least
more than a quarter of an hour
but I'm just waiting
and waiting until the
quick point to make it.
I already thought you guys were
going to talk about some
technical stuff probably
and I already knew
I was going to say this
long before I even
yeah I think
might even be
from before December so
yeah I have been
saving up to this year
because people don't
don't want to talk to me that often
don't want to talk to me
sometimes I have
other stuff to do.
Where's
Sinead from?
Where's Sinead from?
My sister.
I did you think it might be
your sister?
I announced her when she
came in you might not have been
there.
Okay I got two of you in that case
one and do is this right
one. I got a question
and you seem to be
going to be talking about
something else you can mention
afterwards your turn.
After that my first question is
my question is this right
apparently the Netherlands is
another lockdown
so I read somewhere.
Tell me about that.
Sinead will be able to tell you most
about it because she
is going to have a real job
she's not doing school stuff
with me it's just that while
there's none lockdown we are
having one each year apparently
it's going to be a new tradition
but yeah I'm not very
into the whole news thingy
I'm a crown variant stuff I'm
pretty sure
and we
go basically not good enough
government
which should not be in charge
anymore but that's just my
opinion I can't vote yet so
we're only allowed to have
worn over at the
shops except if you're in
an exam year
or like me
yeah
to be honest not the worst
because then at least
I'll be
able to have more
I'll be able to learn more than
I would online
because they expect you to know
as much
you did that here last year
in England
well I probably
hold you can actually
scot them whales
Northern Ireland
the thing is
every year
there are two
lots of major exams that happen
depending on the age you are
so if you're 16 or
15 to 16 you're going to be doing
your GCSEs
really important to get good grades
and nose
ideally as well
and then people tend to do the
A-levels after that if they want to
go to university and things
but because they cancel
all the exams
and all the exams
cancel and it was
locked down and everything
and the coursework is only part of it
basically in the end
it was based on
by doing using the
protected
mock grades
and so some people got better grades
and they would have got
others got really
horrible grades and complained about it
yeah that's like
everyone just passed
well everyone got graded
in the first time they did
they had the exam stuff
luckily they were
luckily for schools
the grade goes
that there's like
big exams at the end of the year
but then for half
the other half is like
normal tests and stuff
during the year
so they just counted all the
stuff during the year
as your final exam
thinking and
basically
if I had that now I'd pass
with nearly everything
because he wasn't
much good to be fair
but yeah that's
a bit of a
I don't know
I'm glad I didn't have to do
any of that and the whole
maths in school
thing as well
which lot of them had to do
in things or social
distance in the classroom
or have your support
bubble absolute mess
but what I wanted to say is
related to
well the whole
techy conversation
from before
which is why I wasn't too
fussed about
basically talking
earlier
basically
if you think about it
like
technology is very
much like magic
and this is very useful
for people like
my dad who doesn't
understand
or refuses to understand
sometimes I don't know
it's hard to tell
sometimes
like fantasy stuff
like
Star Wars is fantasy
you can't argue on that
it's just fantasy
you're just
sci-fi
yeah you can't argue
that it's sci-fi but it's
it's like fantasy
in space if you
there are
like a medieval versions
of the songs and they usually
have like
art of like
Jedi if they were not
if they were actual nights
and they look
exactly the same
it wouldn't
change that much if
technology
well it's not really
I mean it kind of is
a bit like magic
when it works
you know you screen
like something
it sounds like magic
you turn your phone on
when you're computer
and you're greeted
by all this flashy
and there's like
there's like
magic brick
where there's like
yeah we'll get to where it doesn't
work in the chat so
you put that
and it just
and it works
and you got to just
lit up stuff and there's menus
and there's
all kinds of things
you have a magic brick
and we're just talking
Clark's second law
any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable
from magic
yes and we already reached
that point
well nearly
nearly
it depends on how
the knowledge
you are about
when it doesn't work
what happens when magic
doesn't work
you're like
try
when it doesn't
you try
I'm talking about from a perspective
of someone who doesn't have a clue
about how it works
yeah
let me just put this in perspective
I'm just a normal
like a normal guy
who just
happens to be friends
with a bunch of mages
and you guys
are a bunch of mages
who know all about magic
and love to tell me
about magic and stuff
and basically
we love to tell you about magic
because you too
can be a wizard
yes
but it takes lots of time
well
if you too can be a wizard
what about you be 40
I don't think they got the
reference
what was I saying
yes it doesn't work
it's just a use
to break basically
when your phone is not charged up
it's just a black thing
horrible looking thing
when you land the top
does work
I think about electronics
that need fixing
and I don't have any
nice
I think this laptop needs
to do with a few little fixes
or will you mention
but if you want to mail it to me
I will work on it
I've got a box sitting here
that I should have mailed
to you months ago
yeah
but like
the computer has some
weird things
it doesn't happen very often
but usually
I just try things
and how it works
like I know for context
like turning it off
non again
that might work
so
the thing is
the thing is
the thing is
how a normal person
would use magic
and technology
we already reached the point
where
I'll tell you what some people do
when the laptops don't work
and I know somebody who's done this
unfortunately
with at least two laptops
and this is what you don't do
with the laptop
but some people do this
they seriously do this
or with a phone
or a tablet or any of this
never do it
but yeah
if accidentally your tablet falls
in the bin or something
that's a little bit different
however some people really do
just do just that
the laptops got hardware problems
it doesn't power on
it doesn't work
they just chuck out
in a black bin bag
yeah yeah
one girl
who
I spoke to online
before years ago
she
threw one in a river
up in Scotland
don't do that either
because the thing is
these devices are made out
of plastic
and they're made out
of other components as well
it's just like with magic
if you use magic wrong
you create either chaos
like
indie
there's like
there are two types of bad
magic zones
there's basically like
where magic goes haywire
and it's all chaos stuff
or where there's dead magic
and there's no magic
and magic can't be used
and there are
uses
for batteries
most dead batteries
can be at least partially
resuscitated
now there are times when you shouldn't do that
but you should always dispose of batteries properly
yes
but the thing is
the thing we were talking about
is like
technology
all this Linux stuff
is magic
what if they explode
well that just
magic explode stuff
right that's like
isn't that a thing
which is
like
and yeah
if you find a use
for a post-exploded battery
yeah
somebody said
if you
use it
don't do that
especially if it's
plugged in
charged as well
there's a lot of things with you in the bath
it's just like magic
if you take
a dragon with you in the bath
dragon might not like it
and then my die
or like
ascension magic
to me
it might not like the water
and then you're dead
or like
for instance you might
just pick up
around them acts
think like
oh this is a good axe
and axe then they attune with it
and oh look
suddenly you look like a dwarf
this is an actual magic item
an actual artifact
which is a really powerful
item basically
in Dungeons & Dragons
it's a specific axe
like from dwarf stuff
so that's
explains why you look
like a dwarf
so only dwarfs can
basically
attuned
without
turning into dwarfs
because they're already dwarfs
don't
appreciate books
he has a really good explanation
on dwarf
spider way
it's really cool
oh i just realized
i just remembered something
i forgot that but yeah
about 20 minutes ago
i believe
you found and hit the new
yeah because
doing that
three hours and a half
we did call it out
you can't really
do you
doing everything wrong
anyway you know
so i'm going to tell
whatever his name is
a little secret about
magic and computers
and tech
that everyone else
a lot of people here are going to know
but i'm going to tell him a little secret
and that is that
you're doing a tablet
and all this stuff
it's actually stupid
and what i mean by that
is that you have to
basically tell it what to do
via a computer program
or it does nothing
oh yeah i know that
but that's
yeah i basically
that well
yeah i know that
because i remembered
the Linux person
which didn't work
as you can obviously tell
i like magic way
more than
like technology and
it's not really magic
it's just clever people
it's a bit like
it's a bit like
it's a bit like
it's a bit like
with the covid vaccines
right we would be
just really clever some of them
yeah really clever people
you know
and the same with like
engineers and things
you know
with all the planes
who invented a plane
who works on planes
but i usually
i have
quite some stories
which i just thought
up in my head and never actually
tried to write but never finished
so if i ever finished
a story just know that
by the way there's an entire
like universe out there
surrounding that story
but basically in that universe
magic there's both magic
and sci-fi technology
this isn't like star wars
where it's like
well it's kind of
this isn't like star wars
where it's like fan scene space
where it's both
use like an incredibly
similar way of magic
the indie has the weave
which is like
like
weave of magic
somebody
i used to
all there
i used to really enjoy all their stuff
what do you mean
yeah
we all people are on a
and come out and ruin it
but it's a bit like
it's like gravity
way back
the apple fell off the tree
and it was like
why does it do that
and somebody figured
out that they think
or gravity
it all kind of went from there
or it was like
how it needs to think
that thunderstorm
this kind of thing
and then people forgot
and rediscovered
and that kind of stuff
but basically
what i have is
i know that's probably
what would happen
but what if magic didn't want it
to happen
like magic
actively destroys
technology
unless you like
let fantasy stuff fall
not having a clash
with
the cool space government
so i can have like
close up
fantasy and medieval stuff
and stuff
so if it's very
technological
it's not very
technological advanced
then it's
probably because
there's a loss of magic
in that area
and that magic in that area
specifically doesn't like
technology
because magic is going to have
sentience
and it's the chamber
of secrets
which is a normal
car until the magic
may fly
that could be possible
basically on their
then you have to
basically take the entire car
apart
in every single piece
even if it's
like there's screws
you have to unscrew the screws
to get them out
every single moving part
every single thing
which can be a different
object
for instance i've got a keyboard
and i have to take out
but when i'm reassembling it
i have to enchant it
and then enchant every object
which comes from that
so it's very expensive
and very hard to have
enchanted items
and the
and some stuff
are like
magic accepts it
until certain levels
depending on the magic
where it is
after watching
rica morty this year
i watched rica morty this year
i've seen this
a bit of that
but not
a whole lot
but yeah
so i basically thought
first
how i usually get a story
well there are multiple ways
but one of the most
common ways to get some
a whole universe thing
by the way the universe
kind of started when i
when i had a
i still have a jacket
with dark industries on it
and then i thought that could be a
company and then i kind of
grew
i like the idea
of parallel universes
that's basically what i thought
what if i was like
the rick
and then
made this whole armor thing
from using a loss of
stuff from starfinder
and then after that
i kind of discarded
but i
i'm going to use that as
the skirt
one of the
old stuff
one of the old concepts i had
was basically like
powered armor
the reason
skirts is because it's a
ballistic skirt
and it's supposed to
protecting the joints
in your leg
and that's actually something being
used and that's why i
used the skirt thing
i should make
just i should just make
episodes explaining
the universe
yeah
i got you
just
it's not my job and
too everyone else is talking
somebody did it like
two years
four years ago
whenever that was
they would do
every hour i think for bet
this place is in New Year
and that one
i was going to punch
bang
i didn't
do it anyway that time
but yeah
more places have gone into New Year
just now
it says
Nova Scotia, New Bronze Week
Venezuela, Bolivia
and Western Brazil
we're doing in the whole chapter in geography
just about Brazil
if any Brazilians are
listening be happy
we have an entire chapter
so i would say
it's a good mix of everything
we had already
so that's pretty cool
but i was saying
so where were we again
oh yeah
so i was reading
lots of magic
because i started doing
magic the gathering
this year
then i just thought
of an entire government system
and now i have a
interspatial government
and they don't allow
a lot of travel between
dimensions
because they're scared
of
because most of them live
through
COVID times
so they're scared
of
people trying
basically they're scared
basically they're trying to
limit their own government
but at the same time
limit their own people
so it's a very
very wonky thing
and a lot of layers
at least four layers
and the whole
ethics
side which is so
very important
and it's just
kind of written down
you know what
you know what
ethics
magic time travel
sci-fi
yeah time travel
i don't know i mean
imagine if you go back
to like
2019
before all of this
COVID and everything that's happened
right and you could go
to yourself and go oh by the way
there's going to be face
mask
all kinds of stuff i'm sure you
would happen
they would laugh
yeah
but that's also
like the only
time travel is very hard to actually
make a good story
because you can either do
the
temperature way which is really good
trousers of time
as it's been shown in
Rick and Morty as well
which you were just talking about
but also various sci-fi
movies etc
is that basically if you go and
change one little thing
in the past
it might have a really big effect
yeah it will have a really big effect
that's why also in my
universe time travel is banned
i think it's technically still
possible but very hard
actually the real world is
supposed to be a part of it
who knows i might just be
another version of myself
from around
turning the same story over and over
and then when i die
i'll become an ancient
undead
spirit god thingy
which i actually
quite like that
the parallel universe
where you are all
this as well
yes yes that definitely
that's actually
that's actually the only
that i think
in that society people
it would be um
wouldn't be the norm
that they
people were into linux
but the people who were
would definitely gain benefits
because i definitely respect
people who can do
engineering
because i realized the value
of that
in any society i think
it's always the engineers
might not be in charge
but they are invaluable
without an engineer
you can't survive in space
without an engineer
you can't have a massive
city
interventional city thing
without any of those
that kind of gross things
raffles
and with some
shop staff in the pandemic
with a lockdown
and there's
a lot still
there's a problem
but
yeah
would it actually be
a good thing to have
a
just a podcast
or would that not be
a good thing
because i don't know
it's
would it be something
people are interested in
or
maybe
you said
if a book is a podcast
i think just do it
your dad would
be happy with that
and then you put up
i
twiddled with
Linux from about
2002 i got
a little bit
serious between
2010 and 2012
in 2013
i got
completely serious
in 2018
the end of the year
i joined Mintcast
without knowing what the
things. I was sent for Raspberry Pi's each one a different model. I've been sent a number
of laptops. Yeah, it's good for you. Get involved. Yeah. Yeah. I think if anyone listening
to this is interested, I don't know how I don't know how HBR actually works. I said to
dad that there should be instructions because I have no clue how it works. But there is
some way right to tell people to comment, right? I'm not. Two things. I got into an
X when I was 17 or 16. Somebody said open source. What's that? I was a first. I used family
computers back then. And then an old family computer came in mine. It was like that's
about $1.2 on there. Grab goes wrong. I can't even get the Wi-Fi working at this time.
And this wrapper went, I don't know, got even at later. But yeah. And I've used it ever since
because it's good. And you get into stuff. But what the thing is, right? You're probably
sitting there thinking, no, everybody's a programmer on here. I'm not a programmer. I can code HTML
on the website and CSS. But I'm not a programmer. Well, I'm a programmer. Can I give up?
I didn't ask. I am not a programmer. I am not a coder. I am not a IT guy. I am not anything.
I'm just someone who uses Linux. Joe is not a programmer, but he's someone that uses Linux.
He also has someone that fixes things. We each had different things. Get into a podcast
with a group of people and see what you can learn from each other and from your audience.
Yeah. And it's also kind of like, I've never actually finished writing a story. I've started
writing stories and the people who've read the stories were like, well, those are great
starts and stuff. I've never actually had, you know, I usually just stay on the topic
for a little while. And then I, you can buy a story on Linux. We use Linux as well. People
offer something. Yeah. I'm an alternate reality. Me would write a story on Linux. But I do
consider my, I do think I know I'm kind of experimenting with stuff with world building.
And I'm having lots of fun with it, even if I'm writing nothing down. I literally, the only
things I have are like a couple documents on my computer, just in case in some old, some
older notes in stuff. And yeah, I've already experienced like a great, there was great shifts
in my way of thinking, writing, that kind of stuff. And I've actually revisited a lot of the
old stuff. And there were some great ideas, which I've forgotten. So if anyone, like, if you want
to try something, I would just suggest trying it, because I'm just trying this thing. And I like it.
And I think most people actually have had at some point had a little world inside of their head,
like how they, like, they're fancy stuff. And if you can write that down and actually make
a cool story out of it, then it can really grow into something. Yeah. If you try to connect every
single thing into one key, cohesive, cohesive reality, then eventually it will actually work.
Yeah, when I was between the ages of like 12 and 16, I want to say I had like a whole sort of
characters, and they had a whole universe and all that. And even though I wound up not doing
anything with it, because I figured out I didn't want to like draw all day. I'm so glad I did that,
because it made me think through a lot of things, like how societies work and stuff like that,
because I'd do like this. And then this, it's like, well, that doesn't make sense that people
do that. Yeah. I've looked up smithing, smithing just for like one sword. It's a really cool
sword was made by four gods fused into one god, but it's just a sword, one singular sword,
owned by one boss of one company, Dark Industries. It's like one of the oldest characters
wielding a really cool sword. And now I've like retrofitted him, because he was kind of fading away
from importance. He used to be the most important character, the most important connection. He was
the connection between everything Derek, the like the boss of Dark Industries. And originally,
I had him take over Dark Industries, but after a little later, I had him found Dark Industries.
So yeah, he used to be very, very important, but after that like Rick and Morty really shifted
everything towards inter. I had made a list listing everything either. Well, not everything,
but like a lot from actual lot of real stuff, which exists from small to big. And then some of the
stuff, which I which we don't know about yet, I just filled in with stuff and there was some
repeating stuff, but yeah, basically, it was pretty fun, but I use that to basically like my
government, basically my inter, inter universal, the multi-versal inter-multi-versal government is
from this size to this size, like I've done that. So yeah. And since then, I, I've had a chain
in like a gradual, basically just went away from the Dark Industries thing, but it's still really
like Dark Industries. It's the, or one of the oldest and most resilient parts of the thing. And I
want to connect every sort with at least a mention of this mythic Dark Industries, just like a little
Easter egg. So I think I've retrofitted him to be, which is something I've done a lot with Dark
Industries. I've retrofitted him to be another version of, well, I don't know what I'm going to
call him, but they're literally just versions of me. I, it's, it's very, it doesn't reflect my ego
very well, but it's there, the inter inter-air galactic government thingy is going to be versions of me.
They're going to be immortal gods, but like I have the power, why not use it? So yeah, the, yeah.
I think what you guys think about that. It sounds interesting. From the creative side of things,
you know, there's, there seems to be enough rich material that you've laid out to have enough
conflict and enough different motivations. There's enough for an entire MCU.
Yeah, actually, the MCU is part, it can be written as part of, of this. Yeah, like Loki was
also kind of a big inspiration for making a painting. But that's the thing too, you know, because
you know, when I see a lot of other fiction that I've read, a lot of it falls flat when they don't
kind of hard to describe until you get to a certain point in the storytelling, but the easiest way
to describe it would be like Mary Sue or Gary Stue Syndrome, where there's one character that
is untouchable and... No, that's not the case. Basically, what I have is that this, this person,
basically, that I always just thought as other versions of me. I know about Mary Sue's. That's
the thing. I am aware of those things. The only way they can turn into gods is if they die. And if
their soul isn't destroyed. And even then, they aren't immortal. They can still die. It's just a
tad bit harder. If they manifest physically, because they can go between not physical and physical,
you can still just kill them. They're killable. Just chop them in half or something. Just whack
them hard enough and they'll die. They'll just come back a little later. So you actually just have
to sever their connection with whichever realm they'll they're connected to. And you can do that
several amounts of ways. That's why they try to guard it that much. Mostly, they actually
are connected. They keep their connections in false, not kind of stuff. They try to have it.
That's the thing. They want it to be safe and the safest is with the government. But at the same
time, it's also like what if someone infiltrated the government and stuff. And also all the all
like dead dead devils are all going are all live in like the usually they go to the capsule basically,
which like, yeah, that that basically city that can teleport to places and stuff. I think I know.
Because obviously, if you're so if you're if you turn into a immortal god, it will be pretty sad
that everyone you'll ever love will be dead later in not that long of a time to you. So if you
then go to a place where people don't die like that. Also, they have the choice to turn into that.
They don't actually have to. So they can also still die. And I'm specifically not using the dead
the dead ones like the gods as as as characters. Because I know that will be way too overpowered.
They could just use stuff, not not to die, for instance, or something. There will be no tension.
Oh, I'm going to use stuff like a necro necro illusioner, the necromancer slash new illusioner
who's not dead yet and tries his best not to be that kind of stuff who might who might actually
have problems if you were to actually die or something or like people who aren't of that group
who can still normally die that that kind of stuff. Yeah, as long as there are
limits to what the powers can do, that's that's actually pretty important. And as long as it's
it's established that they can do it. Like, for instance, I haven't seen the the episode 7889,
but I know Ray can do a lot of overpowered stuff, which doesn't make sense like bringing
people back from the dead. That's simply not possible in Star Wars. But that's like apparently
the finale of a movie. So that's not something I'm going to do. I'm not going to bend the rules to
to make them either feel or succeed. I'm going to try to make it as limiting as possible without
defeating the core concept of what they are. Because they aren't like God's gods. They're like
really powerful individuals who are bordering on gods. They can't actually they can't usually they can't
like work reality in their place. They can't do anything of that sort of thing.
They're like ghosts. We can come back, but then as not as like shells of who they were like
actual versions of who they were. Like still physical and stuff. They're just immortal. And then
mortal meaning they don't age or get sick. That's the definition of immortal. They can still be killed.
Right. Yes. I think that's a good base to build on. I've
lot of more dumping right now. Yeah. Yeah. And then that happened. But it happened. Yeah.
One thing that I posted on the chat were a couple of links to some handy open source software
that might help. One problem I personally ran into with a lot of my earlier writings and
earlier code and other creative endeavors was that I didn't use open source software to do those
things. So you know, over the years, I've lost a lot of things because the files can't be opened
anymore. And you know, because it's on the proprietary software and you can't find it anymore.
And the and the computers that I used. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I mean, I don't have
on myself, but I was reading about a bad article before sort of about that kind of thing where
basically people had the work that had old documents spreadsheets maybe as well, whatever
word processing, but it was all done in proprietary software. It was done on old computers
possibly as well. And then things change as time goes on. And then if it's proprietary, you might
lose access or the computers aren't work. And that's the advantage of open source as well,
because generally speaking and anything that's open source as long as people are still interested
in it and our developers, of course, that that will carry on. It will be around for a long time
to come. It's a bit like Linux is based or well not Linux kernel, but aspects in the operating
systems are based on new Dex still all similar to Unix. And that's from the 1970s. So that just
kind of gives you an idea how much history there would guess it. Yeah. So one thing, if you
haven't already, you might consider using things like a Libre office. Yeah. Joblin's a very good
suggestion too. Yeah. Because it's basically a good free alternative of free as in Libre and
free as in free as in free. Yeah. There's all this stuff, but you're that proud at the same time.
Yeah. Because I used to write all this stuff down on like paper and stuff, but I kind of ran
out of a script of what's it's called and notebooks and stuff. So I began using the Google Docs on
my school computer because I already used that and stuff, but it literally just copy-faced it. Yeah.
Google Docs. I mean, I was thinking he was talking about with old software and then you do that
with this now. Google Docs is probably not the worst thing because that's probably going to be
around for another 20 or years or something yet. Come. How are they could drop Google Docs one day
and you scare you know what? We can't be bothered with this anymore. Yeah. That's why it's recommending
Joblin because then you can kind of have that like sharing across devices like Google Docs without
being beholden to Google. Yeah. I think what I'll, what I might do later on, I don't know,
is copy the, copy the documents over. Though I'll have to go through all the documents because I do
have a lot of like all the important school documents or say all the important school doesn't think
it that way, but they are. Can the grand scheme of things are really finished most of the stuff.
Not really that important. I'll just copy-paste it over. That's like the most easiest way to do it
because it's literally just text. There's no, I usually don't use any images for just
for anything like that. I just, yeah. Yeah. And that's what a WordPress process word
text or is for really it's text. I mean, you can't put images into a word processor, but
that's a bit, you know, it's a bit, it's for text. Exactly. My point, I can just copy it over. Yeah,
like I can use the, I don't know if all those things the same shortcuts as my laptop does,
which are very useful shortcuts. Like, yeah, there's some for fancy letters and stuff. I know
Libra Office, my mother uses that, that I'm pretty sure. I think there are something
used enough for herself to be fair, but I think Libra Office, you can change some of those shortcuts
if that's sorry. And you can even change layout like how it looks a little bit as well.
Yeah. Keeping things in plain text will definitely be your friend for longevity.
Yeah. So you mean dot text, that's, yeah, it's been the mouse. Yeah. And paper is even
longer as long as the paper is kept in good condition, which it is. I've got a little
actually, well, yeah, but if you had a file or something, your paper could possibly get burnt.
But if you've done it electronically, you could have your backups, you can have your copies of
your electronic documents. And then hopefully, and they can have stuff on the cloud or something,
maybe now. Yeah, you could just scan the problem is, is that when you scan something, it doesn't
always get the faint, the faint pencil stuff. And there's always like images, like I, when I write
something in just notes, it usually like scribbles stuff, or like, you can also use small and
paint, you can also try to write on a computer sometimes with the right, with like a pen.
That's not the problem. The problem is converting the paper things to the computer,
because I already like writes stuff on the computer now when I want to make notes.
I've actually got like stats for like four, well, two are finished and two are not,
like creations from that necromancer illusion in which I already mentioned.
And yeah, that works just fine, but if I want to convert my things written on paper to stuff
on the computer, it's a bit hard to do. I could try to scan it, but that generally when I try it,
it doesn't work out that great. You don't get the detail you usually have from just looking at it.
Your eyes work better than a scanner. Certainly. One middle ground there would be,
if you got a sketch or an image developed to a certain point that you would want to go back to it
later, perhaps take a picture of it. Most smartphones could take a picture in sufficient detail,
capture them. Well, yeah, depends on the thing. Like some of it, yeah, I think I could take a picture
of it. Some of it I might even be able to scan. But some of it, the text is faded enough so that
you can still read it. Otherwise, I would rewrite it, which would probably just make it worse for
copying. But I don't want to erase it just in case I erase something important. But I can still
read it, but it doesn't register on either taking a photo or scanning. Yeah, because most of it
is quite already, like, maybe more than a year definitely, more than two years maybe,
don't know exactly. But yeah, like for instance, the sort I was talking about, like that has
a bunch of stuff. And it's also like very, very small writing. Like I start out big, then I get
smaller and smaller and smaller. The more I realize I don't have any space left. And then eventually,
it's so small that you can, that it's barely eligible. That that's how I, that's how I make notes
usually. Oh, one other couple of other things that I posted. There are some links to some sites
are open source friendly, obsidian, log seek, and Zettler, as well as Joplin posted. Those are
open source applications that are also available on Windows and Mac. So it's not just Linux.
But the superpower behind those apps that might really help you out as you flesh everything out.
They let you have notes to set up links to other notes without having to provision a wiki.
I think that might help you at some point, especially as you get closer to actually writing or
like putting together, like whatever form your project will take. Like if it's going to be a podcast
or YouTube videos or something like that, because you'll be able to write a note and say, okay,
this place was built by xyz individual. And then you can have a link to another note about xyz
individual. And you can start to like it might help with linking things together. And you know,
help flesh things out and make them perhaps more realistic or well relatively speaking, of course,
you know, and you know, it could be very helpful in, you know, helping to manage that complexity.
And you might even discover like things that are possible as more characters and more places
get added in. What is actually possible? Then I might not forget like all the old stuff because
I think we remember like, yeah, but then I also have to try way hard and not to just rip off
someone else's creation, which is how I usually start out my creations. And then if it doesn't,
and if I can't get it any better, well, then it just, it's rip. It's literally just sometimes.
Because I ran to that too or one of other and I helped some other people remember that nothing's
really actually truly original. Everything's just different combinations of different things.
So if you find you're having a hard time kind of being original, just say, okay, what are like,
you know, take multiple other fictional universes and kind of combine things into a new thing?
That for instance, if I have a character, which I, I usually used indie to create stuff because
they've already gotten rules and stuff. And I have a lot of trouble limiting things. I always
had like really overpowered like creatures and stuff. So, um, limiting things is, is, is, uh, very,
very, is, is hard for me. So I'll, uh, I've gone better at it, but, um, I'll usually look towards
another thing, which has already done it to, um, to basically forget how I'm supposed to do it.
But sometimes then if I take inspiration from some of me, I'll say D&D, I might literally,
just for instance, make a character, which is, for instance, a tiefling, a tiefling. And how I'm
going to explain that. It's a tiefling. Anyone who's got good eyes can tell it's a tiefling and stuff.
And I'm also not very good with coming up with names. So then you've got the problem of, what am I going
to name it to make it original? Something else, which isn't tiefling, but tiefling sounds so
good already. That kind of stuff. Yeah. Could be helpful. Um, so using something else as a template
does help you focus more time on the parts that are truly unique. I just, uh, it's very useful
something else's template. One thing I posted in the chat is a quick link to the hero's journey.
Up a lot, a lot of narrative arcs and storytelling. Yeah. And you know, it's amazing like over thousands
and thousands of years of human history and mythology and, you know, religion and culture,
how many stories that are central to human civilization can be, can be described as a variant
of that hero's journey. So where we have a very specific character who, so even if they are
predestined to one of the gods, there's still a process, there's still a, we're like,
a bit of a word, a ritual that they must go through, um, like a, like a departure from wherever
they are, an initiation to prove that they are ready for the final conflict. They're a ultimate
return to greatness. Um, and a lot of the good stories have that as core. There aren't too many
enduring tales of antiquity that stray too far from that. You know, some people,
if some circles would have a very low opinion of the hero's journey, but the thing is when you
look at what they write, you know, are, are the things that they create. It's, it's very boring and
flat because they haven't, you know, they haven't come up with a truly unique novel way of balancing
all of the things that the hero's journey can balance for you. Yeah. I mean, I think, I wonder
about why everything has to follow something of a hero's journey. Um, and I think just,
there's just narratives that appeal to human beings because we're selfish and it's like, you
know, we want to see things escalate. And the hero's journey, I think, is kind of the most sure far
way to do that because if we can't see ourselves in something very character, then, um, we don't
really care. Yeah. And, uh, I think this is, it's very useful, definitely. Uh, also, yeah, I,
I think I haven't really used it that much. I really haven't gotten that far, usually in writing
things. The furthest story I got is actually, it's pretty, pretty good, but it's in, it's in the
defunct, um, thing, which I've just kept around kind of like, not just decided, I really want
that, uh, way of having, um, magic in the world anymore, don't want, don't want specific
placeful of magic. Um, but basically, so the, uh, the guy is, I know if it follows hero's journey.
So the guy right is a, our main character is a Duke and he's doing a yearly, um, is, is a
pretty powerful, but very young, Duke and, um, can do some magic and he, um, he holds a, uh, like
festival thing and, uh, people come from all over for the festival, it's a yearly thing in the kingdom.
Um, and then it, um, uh, who was being sat, oh yeah. Um, so one guy is, uh, not really,
they're being very nice. So because the Duke, he's already quite powerful, actually, he knows his
way around the politics table. Um, and this one is an opponent and he captures him doing a little
thing, which is, um, which is, uh, technically punishable. I know, uh, exactly what it was again,
but it was, um, watch, he thought nobody was around, but, um, yeah, it was a wrong thing to do
because this is basically like the worst person in history. Um, not necessarily like, uh, like
evil, it's just said he's a massive, massive, uh, massive douche basically. Um, and, um, so basically
then, uh, the, I, um, he gets, uh, captured and put into, well, basically the, the, the jail
tent for the king to later on the side, um, if he is guilty or not, uh, because he's also a powerful,
like guy and, um, then he's going to send an assassin to try to kill him and there were going to be
like, uh, some events which he partook in and eventually there was going to be an epic battle
between the two to see who would win and then, um, the Duke, uh, uh, uh, our main character,
woodwind, just, and, um, he'd feed, um, the, the, the douchebag to, um, the creature he had,
uh, he had, uh, kept in his, uh, in his, uh, somewhere rather, some, he, he kept a dangerous, um,
sea creature, um, and he just, people he didn't like, he fed to it. So they charge him on a lot more
than, uh, they eventually found a lot more on the dirt on him than, um, it was, uh, originally
charged for. So yeah, and then he dies and that's, yeah, nice. He, he kind of, kind of becomes the
power behind the throne that, that's basically the story. Is, I don't think that's hero's journey.
Is that hero's journey? Um, this is probably not, I mean, whoever he runs into might go on the
hero's journey, but his interactions with him might be events that happen on that other characters
arc. Yeah. Um, another thing that comes to mind is the game of thrones, uh, which is basically
based on, um, you know, European history around the time of the Hundred Years War and the Italian
City States period, um, which actually curiously enough that very few people use that period of
history as a template to draw upon. Oh, I love that. I love that type of like little city states.
Like, I love the politics. I, I, I, I, I preferably, I didn't particularly like, um, like
reading, uh, uh, uh, uh, game of thrones, uh, just like the book game of thrones. Um, because
it was very, very dark. I wouldn't have killed that dog now. That dog was, you could kill the
humans, but not the dogs. That would be evil. And you killed the dog. And that's just evil.
Like we, I, I'm not going to kill dogs. Well, depending on the dog, but like, not going to kill,
like, no, non-sentient magical dog now. So, um, but yeah, I, I, I actually, uh, quite like the
politics of the whole thing. And, um, the politics of those states and stuff. And yeah, you think
that's really cool. See, I continue. Yeah. So, yeah, there's, um, yeah, I, I definitely think you
have enough material to start something at least. Um, no, it may well be that, um, as you start to
realize this project, find more details make co-op along the way, or new opportunities may come
up along the way, to link things together in a way that you perhaps have it, uh, expected before.
But yeah, I, I think you definitely have enough to start for sure. And then, you know, there's the,
you know, the main thing as far as like using our leveraging technology or the, the, the magic
of technology to help you bring that to life, you know, just as far as possible, stay with
the open source stuff so that you don't get locked out of your world, you know, in a few years,
you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, think of, well, but most of my world is just stored in my
brain. I just remembered that, that, that is some, you, it's a very fickle thing. It's very,
uh, hard to remember all the exact details, but all the like, the hard stuff I've written down,
at least somewhere in paper and I'll, I'll make sure that I, um, that I'll be able to access all
the documents I need. But, um, yeah. Yeah. I think this might also be very useful for other people
who are just like, who might just be interested in like the same stuff as I am, making something out
of their own little world, which is a big world. It depends on how much stuff you've got.
Right. Yeah. I just get, um, a little concern sometimes when I see so many creative people,
especially knowing what I know now about open source, they think that, um, are they put so much
of their time and their effort and their life work, um, into silos, you know, these proprietary silos,
you know, I've been burned that way in other people who have been burned that way too. But yeah, that's,
um, yeah. This is literally just, uh, what, what do you mean? Because this is literally just a hobby,
I'm, I'm not going to make a job out of this. Well, you know, maybe, maybe, no, I don't think so.
I don't think I'll ever be able to make a job out of this, but I'm, I'm able to have fun with
what I have. Yeah. And that's, that's certainly viable. Um, the situation I personally ran into,
I had a bunch of, um, well, code and art and some lore for a couple of old video game projects
that I put together, uh, from a time where I wanted to, you know, a, you know, because there was
a space game and then they, um, RPG that I wanted to make sketches for racing game that I had.
And some of those projects were fairly far along. It was in like a rough prototype under RPG.
However, uh, because I used a lot of old software that was proprietary, I lost it all because
I don't have a computer that can open the files anymore. I add a backup of some of the stuff,
but the backup wasn't a, it was also a proprietary program and I lost access to that as well.
And so there's, you know, even though it wasn't a commercial project per se that I was going to
make a lot of money on, that's a good chunk of my life that only exists in the string of ones
of zeros that I can't even get to anymore. Um, and so if that kind of thing does wear down on
you after a while or at least it doesn't for me because, you know, it's like, you know, even though I,
you know, my, my livelihood does it depend on getting a hold of that. That's true, but at the same
time, you know, it would be nice to at least review it, you know, to look at it, you know,
to remember some of the cool things, you know, because yeah, because I have that with my, uh, with
my old stuff, like all the notes and stuff. I look back and then and think, oh, that's cool.
Hey, I can use that again. And if you can access it, yeah. So basically more of the story you're
saying is, um, make sure that never happens to you. Right. Exactly. Um, always make sure you're
on top of if the software you're using is up to date or not or could be taken away. And always
make sure if you've done something on one type of thing, make sure you copy it over to whatever
possible. Yes. Yes. Make sure there's at least one other copy of what you have.
Perfection would be the three to one rule, you know, three copies of your data, uh, two different
medium one off site. Uh, but yeah, even just one other copy that is not on the same place that
you normally work in. There'll be a lot more than what a lot of people have. So yeah, but yeah,
everything I do nowadays, I make sure that I'm using something open source, um, because like in
the, I've only been involved in open source for about, um, well, I guess about eight or nine years
now. Um, and yeah, everything I did in the past eight or nine years, I can get a hold of generally
speaking. Yeah, that's very useful. Like I have a lot of stuff bookmarked on my phone, um,
like a lot of music and stuff. So, um, today actually, or was it yesterday? Oh, yeah,
yesterday, because it's already five in the morning. Um, yesterday, uh, Schneid, um, showed me,
um, a thing on an asteroid called Spotter, uh, Spotty Flyer, where you can basically put
URLs in it and then, um, it'll get the music and it'll, you can download it on your phone.
So I've basically just got the best ones and I put it on my phone and I'm gonna put all the music
I've bookmarked on my phone with that's gonna take ages. Like, I've got like at least a good 10 seconds
worth or, well, more than 10 seconds. Good. A long time of scrolling down and then it's just all
Kevin McLeod, Kevin, that guy made a lot of song. That guy made a lot of music. Yes. I totally,
definitely don't regret telling that all. Also, somebody knows how to help me please, uh,
and touch. There's no helping you anymore. No, I was afraid of that. Yep. Yeah,
open source can do a lot of cool things. I only realized that this year, um, I wanted some
songs. Yes, it's also has to do with songs. They're just like music. I don't like making it,
but I like listening to it, um, from a game and it was an old game. It's, uh, like, um, frozen
bubbles and you have to like, um, do the colors and stuff. And I'm actually, uh, and because I wanted
to listen to the songs, uh, or at least the first couple of seconds of the songs, the ones which
I actually heard because I was, um, uh, I became really good at the game and that's why I'm here.
The first couple of seconds because I was, um, because I was like, yeah, that level's done. That
level's done. That level's done. Even with random stuff. It was really, really funny how that
happened. Like I'm usually not good at video games, so that this one specific, um, color sorting,
color, uh, shooty bowl, reflective thingy, I'm actually good at because I wanted to listen to
the music. But, um, I asked that if he could put it on my phone, uh, because, um, what I did,
my idea of, uh, putting it on my phone was basically, um, me, uh, going to the credits,
looking at all the songs, screenshot, and then looking them up on the internet and maybe then
downloading them from the internet or something. Uh, this was before, uh, I knew about spotty,
the spotty flyer. So I might just have bookmarked it. Um, but basically what he did is he just went
into the game files and he took them. It's like, like, you do it one way and it's so inefficient,
but you don't know of any other way. And then someone else just comes out of the middle of nowhere
and is like, I can do it this way, like way better. And that's really cool. And it, and then I
was talking about it and like, oh, that's so epic to, um, to, I know, I, as someone,
and they said it's the most basic thing ever. And, but I was, and I was like, I know, but it's so
epic. It's so cool. I, I didn't notice the power of, um, of, um, yeah, open source before
that basically, but it's, that, that was really cool. Yeah, open source. Yeah,
it's turned known as about to come up here in about four minutes. Very nice, very nice. I say
what better way than to talk about boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss. I think he liked to scream
with us. First, some other cool, boss tools that, uh, some people are using. One that I want to call
out is, uh, it's called YouTube-DL. And it'll actually let you download videos. Um, and they had
a very interesting, I recommend looking them up. Uh, they have tried to been sued, closed down,
get, oh, I think I was hosting them, got threatened by all kinds of companies. And they've never
quite been able to get shut down. And they're pretty awesome. Um, they're useful if you do any sort
of video editing or YouTube, did you can download videos and then put them. Obviously, they can't
protect you from like, you know, copyright issues and stuff, so grab that in mind, but, um, awesome
little tool to pull the straight audio out of something. Oh, yeah, yeah, you can use it for all kinds
of things. I just, uh, I use it for like, it's own purpose, but I, I had no idea what was up.
Didn't I do what I heard no idea then. Yeah. I think you said, I think you said there were no
idea when you're talking about it. I was kidding. I love that tool. Oh, yeah. YouTube-DL? Yes. Yeah, I
suppose, um, see, there's um, propellants that learn, and Krita actually priced at how well they've
come along. Recent versions of those two tools have been very nice with, you know, experimenting
with illustration. Definitely not what it was even just a few years ago. Of course, it also helps
that I've really had a lot of good use. And, um, male spring actually, male spring is open
source. Very good alternative to Thunderbird, which can be a bit clunky and heavy, but I have
too many email addresses more than I care to admit. Oh, by the way, happy new year, everyone.
It is now midnight in the eastern time zone. Happy new year. Happy new year.
How late is it everywhere? It's, uh, I've gone basically through the entire night now. It's six,
six here. It is. There's a midnight here in the eastern time zone. So that's, um,
Canada east of the prairies, of course, down through the eastern United States, um, all the way down
to most of Central America, most of Latin America, Guatemala, the chunk of the Caribbean as well.
22. I have a discord. I have a discord server with a bunch of my friends and to celebrate,
I'm saying happy new years to celebrate. Here's a bunch of gifs to commemorate 2021 and just a bunch
of middle finger gifs. Yeah, I found, I found 2021 to be like, it's like, like worse than 2020.
Like you have all the, all this stuff from, from 2020, just still around and then you ended with
a lockdown and use a non like all the positives of the, of the COVID stuff kind of disappeared.
The whole like, like the COVID had a kind of thrill to it at the beginning. It was like,
oh, cool. We were part of history. Something important. And you didn't have to go to school back then
and stuff. First, when it came, when COVID first came out, basically, you didn't have to go to
school here and stuff. All very fun and enjoyable and that kind of stuff. But then after a while,
it just, it's tiring. Now, like if you're not immediately affected by like people dying or
people having seriously medical problems, this is how you basically feel. Like beginning, it's,
it's kind of like, it's not the greatest, but it's, it's, it's different and interesting. But
now it's just boring and we've seen it all before and better ended one way or another, basically.
For I actually was lucky. Me and Damien have the same social group and I think we managed to avoid
COVID for the most part. It's just now kind of starting to hit into my circle at all. I,
my mom and a friend had to test for COVID because they, well, my mom worked in a nursing home.
They got like seven cases of COVID. It actually took out some of the residents, which was kind of sad.
Thankfully, my mom didn't get it. Not a friend that had a really bad flu or cold and tested. And
thankfully he was negative. But yeah, it's finally starting to kind of get to my circles and it's like
that's not a fun feeling. I had that before. I had that already before in, in 2021 and it's not the best
I would say it. Though luckily, everyone I care about has not, has not gone COVID and only one class
well, which I can remember a couple classmates and teachers have gone COVID, but they haven't
died. Only one I heard had problems later on. But he was fine for the most part, just a little more
trouble with breathing, which sucks. But yeah, don't really know anyone in the class that well.
Yeah, I'm trying to avoid COVID because I feel like with my luck and my system, I'll get the type of
COVID we're on a toilet for two weeks. Yeah, but I remember like mom with her work, a lot of stuff
had COVID. A lot of people in the in the homes and had COVID and stuff. I remember that I don't
know any specific specifics. Of course, it's so classified and stuff. Blah, blah, blah, blah.
We were talking about open source software. What was that other name that they came out with for GIMP?
Oh, Krita? No, Krita's a whole other application. There was some people who were, didn't like the name
of GIMP, so they came out with, they forked it and came out with a different, basically the exact same
thing just named differently. Oh my god. There was shots made to look like Photoshop. Was that?
Yeah, I just googled this. It looks like they called it GIMP's. That's it. Yeah, I like things about
FOS, but everyone's in a while. You get these like really petty crap that's like stuff like that.
It looks like they've already folded. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they weren't able to find enough maintainers
or enough contributors, rather. Was the popular version of Audacity now?
Following, I haven't seen consensus built yet. I've been looking at that with key interest.
Audacity is one of the early success stories for open source audio editing. The corporate entity
that bought Audacity has done some very shady underhanded things to basically buy to
close source the application and push some fairly invasive telemetry to code base.
Yes. So they're basically taking what was once a free Libre open source application and turn it
into yet another data harvesting product. So there have been a few forks of Audacity in the past
few months. I have not found a good placement. I think. What is the race right now?
Audacity?
I believe it is within the race right now. I believe Audacity might have been actually
replaced in some of the repos. I'm not sure. I think it has been replaced in some of the repos
for Audacity. Why do companies always think of the short term benefit? Well,
looks like they only think of short term money gain and stuff and then completely ignore
things like actual quality in stuff. I know, for instance, I've got a friend who is way
further in watching all the Star Trek stuff than I am and he said that at a point they basically
just the quality went down so far that he thought that earlier season was way better or something.
And the same happened with Star Wars and even stuff which isn't something like that. They
get a good thing and then they suck all the joy and happiness from it and then you're left with
something terrible which no one wants anymore. And that hurts overall profits if you just make
a good thing then people will want a good thing but companies don't seem to get it.
Yeah, I work in a QA and the thing I always kind of try to beat into people is because I've
I've liked from my experiences with QA the problem is that people just want to add like companies
want to add more and more features because the stakeholders and the board members say hey,
we need more features so that our stock prices don't end up. And I keep trying to really push into
them like if your core features that people use your app for don't work they don't give a shit
about the other stuff. And it's really and you get people with MBAs and all that that just do not
understand this and it just makes everyone's life harder and then you know I can't tell you how
many fast food apps and stuff that I've used that have become so unaluted. You're removed.
Dislikes. They removed. Dislikes. They left the dislike button. They just. They left the dislike
button. But it has no use anymore. Because people were abusing it. Abusing it in which way?
Well they would get groups of people together like
fast food or bots and just have you know thousands of people go in and dislike a video for no reason
and it would mess with the metric. It was affecting people's ability to make money.
One other view on that is that several large corporate brands also did not appreciate
or having their official narratives challenged by large groups of people who didn't agree with
them. But yeah the of all the organizations on earth. YouTube would be one of the few organizations
that would have the resources to do the kind of network analysis regression analysis artificial
intelligence to detect when someone is getting bot-bergated and mitigate that. But yeah instead
they've chosen a path to they took the lazy way out they took the easy way out. Yeah and even
something like me who thinks in who doesn't who doesn't even know if that would even be possible
I just think like wouldn't it be handy or just to like make it make the dislikes not count
towards algorithm but still show to dislikes to the people. Like the problem isn't necessarily
the problem is for instance if you want to see a good tutorial on something you don't know if
there's going to be a loss or if it's good if you only see the positive things because who knows
maybe it's a type of thing which people don't engage with often maybe maybe there is a loss of
engagement but people really hate it and it's not very helpful and then you you don't know it because
of the dislikes and it's not like people still can like if it doesn't have any effects it's the same
as just like yeah having a comment underneath the video and like I'll vote this if you
if you don't like the video and then everyone else voting the comments that it's the same thing
basically except if you don't count this like thing so they're literally more easy and more
satisfactory ways to to make make to make it better like I saw so many memes about it and I was
like oh I haven't had that and then I had it very annoying. I'm a bit concerned to see what
will um what impact it will have on the platform um wants a critical mass of videos are uploaded
ever knew the history of the video people have pointed out that a lot of other kinds of abuse
will become so much easier because they took the shortcut so they may wind up endangering the
very hoping to protect anyway yeah or claiming to protect right claiming to hope to protect um also
isn't me or are people just like cursing out randomly like I'm pausing in my sentences because
that's how I speak but like people are cursing out um yeah it seems like people are hopping in and
out yeah but with you when you're talking it just cuts it doesn't say you're talking and then you
and then wait it's for a couple seconds and then it resumes and you're further on in a sentence
where you were it's all yes is all you'll set up because push the talk set up
oh okay because uh yeah then then then then then uh yeah yeah it'll automatically start uh start uh
they'll uh michael automatically pick up as soon as it starts hitting sound so sometimes it takes
a second for the sound to kick in yeah yep yep hopefully that's not too uh distracting it normally
works out fairly well because it helps cut ways and feedback I'm able to make out most sentences but
yeah it's only cutting out a word here and there I'm not gonna cut it yeah it's like cut ways and
feedback that's that's like this is might be just a sentence which uh wait in which that is
important I didn't know but I was I'm able to make you out at least oh one quick question about
this particular podcast um I'm new to mumble is the chat history saved or no okay no and the
second you leave it's gone okay we do we do have a link on the hbr website to some lovely show
notes where if you would like to save some of that information it can go on to there okay and then
and then when I when I post it it is all those show notes ish July ish all right uh yeah uh
it'll uh I can use those show notes uh to put it well I can use those uh the the stuff in the show
notes and the post yeah I don't think I'm gonna have to ask you for a segment this year
my daughters went out with a friend this evening so no more of Kai saying something insane
I still like the fact that you got that added two tilts I love it she hates it it's perfect
yeah and apparently around like 945ish the my laptop just that was rough doing the stream just
completely I'm I'm guessing it went to sleep or something because I come downstairs the screen is
black and like the little lights were flashing in the front it just it like shut down I don't know
what the hell happened I don't so I overheated I don't think so I mean magic horrible dark magic yeah
well the problem is my recording is on the stream and uh yeah the stream goes out to anybody who
just wants to listen and post my recordings on there so missing large chunks well I'm not sure
how large of a chunk as I get my made it down here like if it missed anything it's maybe about 10
minutes okay because the guy the recording laptop is called this guy so back about it go back
in the history to about like nine 45ish this guy what is nine and forty five dollars well okay mine
is mine is you see so it's it's back about four hours back about four hours okay yeah nine
and that was important for sure of course I'm gonna drop the ball
947 this guy was moved to audio tests so that's had to have been around the time that that
something happened with the laptop and then 948 he was disconnected so but I got it back on at
950 so we're going to lost a few minutes there hopefully okay yeah well I didn't think it'll be
the end of the world right that two minutes that you cut out man put in the secrets of the life
the universe and everything yeah well we were here well I know exactly when I was but uh
people were here people have heard it we can be the wise sages and you know the answer is far too
yeah yeah is it is sad that I've been spending a good part of today because there was a reference to
uh uh to uh to that earlier that was trying to figure out what remember what the number was
it's kind of sad that you didn't know it off top of your head yes yes that is sad I felt
that's pretty sad actually your father made the made the reference and it wasn't picked up and I
was gonna say 42 but I mean just the number wouldn't completely out of my head
to know I thought of something right so the answer is 42 we know this the question however
that's another answer I think I think it's the maximum I think it's the number of
tear of uh discworld books before the universe explodes it's 42 when when there are 42
diffs world books the universe will explode that's my theory that that's why he died before um
before he could uh write another book because if he didn't then the universe would explode
it's logical yep very very logical very logical logic there yeah you know I'm sad that Terry
Goodkind is dead but I'm really glad he's not writing the Richard and Galen novels anymore um
which one very good kind both truth and novels I didn't pick up the sort of truth and
novels Terry Goodkind never heard of him if you decide to read the series don't go past the second
book don't go past the second book yeah okay yeah I have a similar series where it's like good
in the stars and then it gradually just gets worse in an every every series written by Orson's
got cards never out of them too but it's really you wrote Ender's game I might have heard of
Ender's game but I wasn't it wasn't something um yeah well didn't really have look into it basically
but it's Archimus Fowl the first book is really really good and it's like uh you probably
have you heard of it yeah yeah Archimus Fowl have you read the books yeah okay so the first book
really really good I would vice reading that second book um also pretty good third yeah fourth
they kill off of yeah there's a there's a major death which I would have put later on in the
series but anyway not so bad fifth still okay some slight amount of time travel it kind of
gets wackier and wackier but it's tolerable on like fifth fifth there's a reason and they only like
there it go to like parallel like like um the time travel they time travel quote unquote
into the future simply by like yeah not having the correct destination in the in the
where time place Orson's got card is actually a fairly prolific writer his problem is is that he cannot
properly and a series and by the time he gets to the usually third book in a series it's complete
and total garbage the exception being the Ender's shadow series which is good all the way through
the third book and then at the fourth book it kind of slides downhill but he should have ended it
at the third book like the like he was originally planning um now the Ender's series itself
Ender's game um speaker for the dead speaker for the dead is still decent but then everything
after speaker for the dead really slides downhill and then the Alvin Maker novels they're good
through the second book and then by the fifth book even the editing is terrible and then um
let's see the gate thief novels um first one is good second one is very meh and then yeah don't
even bother with the third one yep sometimes people just have it like I I I tried I tried right
we had a whole conversation just before um but yeah and um I can never just uh I can never finish it
just because I I already moved on to something else but that arts miss file thing right right
until the fifth book it still made sense but then he gets time travel involved and it's not like the
good temperature time travel it's it's not good time travel like there's problems and all that
kind of stuff and um eventually one really stupid thing is in book eights which like um it
there is a person who time traveled from the past uh to the future and then the future version of
them kills them and instead of like uh the feet the uh like what
unexisting themselves yeah nothing existing themselves everything they've done exploded
why why does it explode this is such a random thing where we are literally told between the
two possibilities either everything fades away and you know the logical thing that they don't
exist in the timeline all of things exist at the same time so each of these objects are in two
places at the same time everything that they've touched or moved and so because object can't
occupy two spaces at the same time everything goes boom yeah the thing is though
but they influenced the uh creation of like mobile phones and stuff so everything like all the
human technology stuff goes boom and um well that's a bit like um oh yeah if you explain it like that
if you if you would explain like that in the book i would be like okay that does make sense
yeah but they just say there are two opinions on it either this happens or that happens and um
well that that just it just doesn't feel right in the book itself should have been explained
the problem with Terry good kinds writing is that you don't realize that it's going downhill
but you read the first book it's good you read the second book yeah it's good but you're
kind of realizing that there's a situation with arts miss foul to be honest and then you get
into the third book and it's still you know it's good but okay and then the fourth book yeah it's
good but it's kind of repeating the second book and then the fifth book is kind of repeating the
third book and on and on and on because in one book Richard will get kidnapped and then in the
next book um can little get kidnapped and then back and forth and back and forth and getting
back up get get somebody gets kidnapped does that like repeating thing of somebody gets kidnapped
reminds reminds me of cat fell but i think cat fell is different cat fell starts off with like um
it's it's a monk in medieval times and he's basically like a murder mystery detectives
right and then um each book has the exact same theme and that's um is bad murder yeah that sounds
not like cat fell it's like murder murder murder each time you know who's going to get murdered
there's somebody going to get murdered there and there's also going to be a subblock with
two people hooking up usually 40 or 50 times throughout the book you get the explanation of how
a confessor's power works and by the end of it you're so tired of hearing about how a confessor's
power works and you just want to choke the shit out of the person that wrote it and then you realize
you said you move on oh that would that would suck because uh yeah you don't want to listen to how
to exposition or 20 times over you want to listen to it once and if you don't know exactly
you come back again if i can understand yes but if you want a lot of it's in the book then you give
a lot of exposition like for instance this is how um this is uh what the specific castle looked like
and this is the defending thing of the castle now we're not going to attack the castle
be there but now you know the thing about the castle or like hey this fairies are like
casually being mentioned but here's like the whole thing and history about fairies which
but both i've written i've done something like that well like i'm saying and give me something new
don't re-tell me the same thing in the same book a hundred times i understand you know
wanting the novels to be independently readable and re-explaining it once at you know
towards the beginning of the book i don't need it explained over and over and over again in
free book and the other thing with Terry Goodkind was he finished the series i read all the way
through till he finished the series and it was a good solid finish despite the fact that you got
tired of the overarching theme and the explanations i stuck it out and then he tried to write a new
series and that's expanding on way distant future events in the same uh timeline but nobody bought
so he went back and continued on with the original series dropping that new series and it just
that sucks eating a dead horse and it was you know you'd already done okay well the world was split
up into this one into two sections well we opened that section up and now these two sections are
merged together but oh wait there's another section that's blocked off in the world over here
so then we opened that up and then oh wait there's another section that's blocked off
this is just another small chunk of the world the world is much bigger than you thought
gotta know it yeah yeah and that's very annoying it's uh yeah yeah but like um that that's not
something uh that does uh well god felt kind of has a problem i think with um and the uh
writer is actually very time or was i know if their life still but uh very talented writer
in um being able to kind of make a good story around it because i'm pretty sure that the people
who were um who were uh basically um like what's it called producer of the book now uh something
like that they basically uh they basically wanted to have um the in the beginning um she kind of
said i was a kind of theme like uh there is murder and the two people are gonna hook up and then
uh and it won't hook up but can't and cat fell is gonna solve it in some way and uh the problem
wasn't the hunger games uh yeah i haven't books for terrible but it's the hunger game wasn't twilight
that was garbage it couldn't make it past the first chapter uh i haven't even tried reading it
because sometimes you know it it could be handy to have a look at it like the uh sequel trilogy
of Star Wars i need to have a look at it to combat it effectively but why light i don't even
i just know the summary of in a plot of the movie version which i don't care if you're a vampire
i love you yeah i i don't care the first chapter of the first book of twilight but at least
twilight didn't have jar jar banks hey jar jar banks is a cool sith lord okay i've looked at
everything it is a sith lord tell you jar jar banks is a sith lord and there's nothing
in the what evidence is there again this jar jar not being a sith lord have you
and find his asshole with both hands in a map that's right so want him to say that's what he
wants you to think so i went back a while ago and i decided i was gonna uh rewatch everything
from episode one all the way up until i mean even like uh rogue one going into new hope um and
watch everything from the beginning do you want to clone wars what's that the clone wars see what's
the clone wars but uh the animated animated i just watched it i like it i made you watch the animated
e-walk i i have not made it through the first season of clone wars because the first season of
clone wars is most most of this of every episode is we went to this place we watch these
Star Wars droids yeah i didn't watch those old 80s i might have seen them back in the 80s but
did you watch the holiday in mind that but past like if you get that later in the series it
goes a bit like um if there's bigger there's there are actually arcs like uh pond crawl everyone
hates pond crawl and you'll figure out why once you reach that part so i i know there's more to the
uh the clone wars i just i have to make it past those big of those uh like basically the first
season i think yeah once they make it past the first season it's supposed to get a lot better but
yeah yeah like in my season you're confused and you're like okay they're gonna beat up these guys
they're gonna beat up this yeah yeah it's just like we went to this skirmish we it was really
aren't we beat these guys but there was like no uh there's no like real rhyme or reason
anything that it's like we went to this fight we won yay we went to this fight they took our droid
we've got our droid back we won yay that was like it there's no like yeah our broader story
but my initial point was when i initially started this whole journey i mind that my my previous
thought was that jar jar binks wasn't that as annoying as he was and that everybody was just
blowing it out of proportion and then i went back and rewatched it he was really that fucking really
that bad i i i i i had to start losing myself thinking that jar jar binks wasn't like that bad he
was just like okay he's kind of comic really no no he was that bad he either checked it himself
enough into the episode one to be so annoying that it was horrible um i watched it i didn't mind it
personally but i watched it with the first time with the perspective of him possibly being a Sith Lord
and when i did that oh my god it he's definitely 100% the Sith Lord you can't
he he's such a good Sith Lord that he even manages to fool Palpatine into thinking he's just a clown
that's how good of a Sith Lord is and then what does he do in the empire he disappears why we don't
know he just disappears after helping Palpatine rise to power he disappears why what reason like
because we just interrupt this real quick just to say happy new year for Miami
hoping hoping you all are are having a wonderful 2022 so far yeah
so a minute fantastic talking about Sith Lord go with it definitely one hopefully i'll get
anyone yeah all right y'all continue i'm off take it easy yeah happy new year man happy new year
but literally i also watched the Clone Wars and there was for instance an episode right
and i first i didn't know why he was doing what he was doing i thought it's silly maybe he's not
a Sith Lord how can i explain this for him being a Sith Lord very easily actually so what he did is
he went up to like the pilot and he um he accidentally um air quotes um uh went up to the pilot and
messed around and calls to the ship to crash well turns out that the guy who was um who outranked
him was killed he's now in charge now jarger binks isn't charged and because jarger binks isn't
charged things don't escalate that's the thing he just takes control of the tanks and things don't
escalate which um yeah because basically there's a all like a pirate thing and people were being
kidnapped all you know republic versus separatist thing and the pirates are in the middle and
some people were betraying the pirates and it was gonna and a very very bad for everyone
especially the very cool pirate guy um if jarger binks hadn't stepped in and um mediates
the situation then you might ask why would a Sith Lord want to mediate the situation
the reason being is that the Clone Wars is orchestrated by a Palpatine a Sith Lord and it would
probably um probably stop or at least the plan would be hindered the great plan which the
Sith worked a thousand years for would be hindered if not delayed or just stopped if duku
was died died if duku died or was captured by um by uh by the republic because yeah that was
the state so basically it was if um the way jarger binks did it it made that um duku could escape
and that the republic um and that the Clone Wars would continue and otherwise the whole thing would
basically collapse so he made sure that the empire could exist he could yeah that's just one
example and there's like many like literally every episode he he he appears in there is something
which uh which explains all his actions i take your silence as uh uh as a response say your
mind is blown by my factual by my uh great observing of jarger binks i'm gonna go with yes
it makes sense though come on sure i'm gonna go with it and you there's a choice you can either be
super annoyed by jarger binks and hate him and that kind of stuff or you can think he's really
cool because he's an evil Sith Lord and self i'm just going with the one which gives me the most
enjoyment like for instance um in the new cannon they um they don't have the ujong bomb which
i didn't read any of those uh stories of the expanded universe because i was way too late for that
but i always like the concept of like the ujong vang um so i think like the grisk which replaced them
um have are being uh are being like driven up by some scouts of the ujong vang so like um
they try to fortify the galaxy which is like what the chis are doing and in response the chis
are trying to fortify the galaxy against the grisks so in yeah if you understand what what i'm
talking about it it's very cool does anyone even understand or care what i'm talking about um
what was it love i didn't species love stuff just choosing the choosing the option which gives you
most enjoyment yep sorry two conversations going on at the same time we were arguing about the movie
the joker and a couple of other things in the in the chat as well as the the conversation about jarger
so i got locked in the chat oh yeah i haven't i haven't been reading the chat too yeah that reminds me
but yeah you can do two come that's uh that's a pretty good two conversations in one by the way
but um like the new canon stuff i i i only arrived to the sour scene after the whole new canon
stuff so um the way i deal with the canon thing is basically like if it's not contradicted by the
new canon and you like the legends version then the legends version is canon for you at least and
if if you um and the way i do it is i basically prefer if something is canon unless it was in the
sequel trilogy then i don't like it because i just i started watching it and a nearly literary
through up because it was it just the start it they they ripped off like they tried to rip off
and you hope just like well i've been trying to look at a lot of it as um i'm just going to relax and
try to enjoy the ride because you know a lot of people were talking about how the
uh what is it episode six but god damn it the the the newer uh season the the newer series of the
the Star Wars was was was crap and how the new one was exactly like new hope and i tried to just
take it as hey it's a fun cool movie i mean yeah but i was just so confused and i had to like uh stop
watching it and i i went on to watch Marvel stuff um and that's how i actually started watching
the whole um MCU thing is um i i started watching it it's not necessarily that it was bad at least
the the the part that i watch it's just that um they give no explanation for why the new why the
first order appears it's like who's the first order what's it doing and you might think well
that happened in episode four but in episode four we get a we get later on we get the prequel series
who literally just sets up all this stuff from from before season four and then between all the
gaps between the movies is filled up with animated shows like um like uh um the clone wars bad batch
and rebels they completely fill the holes in between the movies so where is any explanation
from what why the empire was defeated in episode six but why is there another empire in episode seven
just at the starts that that yeah that was just like yeah oh yeah explain they did a horrible job
trying to explain anything that happened between or or if like the the the last of the Jedi is
was supposed was originally just um basically basically um beforehand it was Darth Leia and uh uh
uh luke and then um what's his name do uh well i guess was sonar palpatine or whatever the uh
after after the others died i mean you should have just been um leia and luke and i really
haven't watched that far so well you're talking about um well actually i that's not true either
because then there was the uh apparently luke had started a school for whatever remaining
uh Jedi's were left and you know where he was able to find and scrounge together
but i don't know i i said i tried to with a lot of times with movies like this i tried to just
kind of sit back relax and try to enjoy the ride i don't expect my my expectations for um
continuity is is down to nothing i just basically i hope for the best the best people who have
done anything with continuity has been the embassy you and you know they haven't screwed it up
screwed up continuity yet but that's because they've had basically one guy running most of it
that's why we always take care of what they're working on screwing up their continuity right now
but they're working on doing it in such a way that you know
extent multiverse yeah they're trying to do it in such a way in which it's in actually enjoyable
instead they can replace aging actors or actors that want to leave the series
yeah which is yeah which is a good thing to be honest that should be possible but it's such a long
thing actually uh uh when when i heard like multiverse i was like well that's that's a very
interesting thing very well done there give yourself a pass on the back but i quite i quite also
like the Loki thing yeah nice look at it and it was all very clear to me all this stuff but then
again what's clear to me not necessarily means that it's clear to other people you know and i
just hope that the that the embassy doesn't screw up the most verse like uh the whole DC does
multiverse is how they explain the fact that they can have 15 different bearings of one character
uh-huh yeah um i i have one cough spider-man cough cough
i want to see a new spider-man scene i want to see it so bad i haven't yet seen spider-man
don't spoil spider-man yet spider-man homecoming i haven't seen it either but i know that the other two
spider-men are still in it oh yeah me too i definitely know that that was unavoidable but that
that's just pretty cool because people apparently like those movies haven't seen those movies
but people like them so if people like them might not bring them back then with the original people
who did it that that's what i like that they bring back the original people who were um who played
all the like yeah villains and like eras and stuff all the all the characters yeah i want the
Netflix uh Marvel shows in the MCU now yeah i heard something Netflix uh i heard something like
Marvel shows like i i was very confused what actually was canon and what was not because
i definitely know like all which movies are canon into the MCU well now it's a bit more um
more hard to pinpoint now with the whole milky first thing but um which series like i just know like
Wanda fishin lowkey wazif and falcon in the winter soldier are there more well Hawkeye just came
out oh yeah all of those are basically kind of like uh to keep pushing the original stories forward
a bit like uh uh wanda vision was a way to continue telling the story of wanda and well wanda and
vision they basically brought vision back from the dead and uh yeah so wanda turns i think a little
bit more evil and then uh vision yeah it turns more towards good but it's it's like a whole different
it's really good it's really good how they did it i watched it all like all in one day
because that's how good they did it they uh they also thought told me about um sitcoms which
i was very happily surprised about because i definitely would like the 2010 stuff i recognized it
but that was from also um now that's probably because it was carried over into like um after 2010
so yeah like that they um get like the people and then they um and then they have the people on those
chairs and make them tell about their points of view that kind of stuff and they really brought
it nice together with like the with what was actually going on yes are you talking about sitcoms
you've never heard of sitcom before oh no i heard about them and i've actually watched them that's
what i said i recognized some of the things it's just that i i'm not that old so i haven't
watched that much also i literally i i i only recognize the last uh i only recognize well big things
from the last the last uh type they did like i knew some stuff from before but like i don't really
watch that so yeah i used to watch that and well my sister used to watch um something from the last
type more um more often so um i i i am familiar with that so yeah i i thought that was pretty cool
so educational you should stop what you're doing but watch all uh buried with children right now
very with children well and yeah very was pretty good that wasn't hard to watch all of it all of it
all like 19 seasons of it yeah i'm not sure if you'd want to watch all of them
i'm not sure he would want to watch all of them what was when uh they adopt the kid for a while
or when she had another kid no no no she was pregnant and then she lost the baby okay and then
the baby yeah the actress actually lost the baby oh like and you know they had been spouting
they've been really really talking about how she was pregnant she was pregnant she was pregnant
and they were going to have a baby and then she didn't have the baby because something happened
in real life and then so they just completely ignored that afterwards you know it never happened
in the tv show and then she got pregnant again and they kind of just took her off the show for a while
just had her do uh bone-in scenes and stuff like that oh that's what she left that's what she left
to like her family or something yeah yeah she went in a season with her family or something
so i'm gonna check on what she didn't have a baby but they never mentioned it on the show
and then they adopted a kid or like a cousin or something just showed up and stayed there and then
they you know retconned that and then they brought the kid back but he'd been like hiding out at
the dorsies it got confusing i've never watched them all in order but if you want to watch like
trusa comes a lot of the beginning stuff of one division was more towards like the witched in
dick van dyke show ask yeah but you pretty much got to be a big marvel pen for for one division
yeah but i mean yeah but i don't think he is yet am i a big marvel well i'm not i'm
not really very proficient with the comics but i did when i watched him one division you must
realize i've spent that entire summer just watching marvel movie after marvel movie after marvel
movie so it's just keep on coming yeah yeah then i've seen like an easter egg and i and um i'm like
oh that's the thing and then in the youtube video which i saw about the thing they like all that
circle and i'm like how did nobody notice that for 10 years or something i know for like very long
time because i'm like oh yeah i've just watched two movies after each other or like this like i
watched a movie and then i'm couple more than movies in between and then all the movie that's just
yeah very easy they're kind of stuff how are you on the simpsons simpson don't watch the simpsons after the
movie well the movie i didn't watch the movies um fair enough like 40 seasons now or something
something like that they still just the hits just keep on coming along with the
installation comedy and history yeah i know they predicted the loss of stuff that's for sure
well if you do enough i'm sure it's gonna happen you know yeah it's gonna like the spray effect
yeah yeah if you're gonna do enough stuff then eventually you'll be right if you're gonna
spout a bunch of nonsense for like a year nonstop then eventually you'll find something somebody might
look back at it and find something which will have happened right yeah and then when you're done
watching the simpsons you can move to south park no i don't i've also heard about south park
yeah less than a minute mostly um well the thing i can remember now is when rica more tea said
my socks have now what you did it what happy new year happy new year to show and all the mtexins out
there happy we're gonna have happy new year happy new year joe denny happy new year
now what you do to do is it is find yourself some nick at night and go back and watch things like
like i said watch bewitched and um uh what was a little bit dig van daik show the problem
when they changed uh the dick yeah okay okay go back and watch mcales navy all of that
absolutely yeah or or uh that film yeah um no what was
hogans heroes hogans heroes yeah no no um what was the show uh with sergeant bilko
uh sergeant bilko no that was the movie the the the tv show was named after the actor
oh um film silvers yep the film silvers show
that was a good show didn't see that one okay
yeah i like i don't think i'm very much a uh sitcom person well that depends on the premise of
the sitcom of course like if it's school like fat and see probably like uh something i know um
good character second stuff um and i start watching it from the first time it's released
well then i can just keep on updating basically or like if it's like hermit craft i
it's that's kind of a sitcom right except it's made not made by a tv crew it's made by just
bunch of random people on the internet playing minecraft hey joe did you realize there's a sergeant
bilko movie starring Steve martin yes yes i watched that too it's a good well the tradition movie
it's less than two stars on on uh rotten tomatoes 31 percent what do they know
yeah usually with when people say that movie saw um i usually um i usually
don't mind like it's very rare that would be it matters how it sucked why it sucked and who says
it sucked yeah true yeah kind of yeah or maybe you just like it maybe maybe it um yeah good my
if it's something which could be better well yeah i generally don't go for stupid comedies
wait a minute i just mentioned the subsumes the subsumes and it's not stupid comedy it's this well okay
it's a dumber dumber dumber that that is not all these saw what's his what's his name uh
cartoon no no no there's there's one guy that does a whole lot of really stupid movies has a really
stupid character and he makes a lot of money doing it i know it's him carry no oh
describe it a little well the water boy the water boy Adam oh um sandler yeah yes i'm
saying there i cannot stand anything he's done that name is familiar Adam sunda is he isn't
Jake from Brooklyn and you see no that's uh no um that's a sand sander yeah um dang hold on oh come on
right there's a movie with both of them in it too uh that is players like that
does it do that December yes yeah yeah similar name yes it is both an a at the beginning and an s at
the end uh uh yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah a lot of good actors in that show yeah
Brooklyn nine days good nine season just have like yeah we're like nine episode yeah i can only
watch a few seasons of that before it just got to be too much the same thing but uh i'm great
Broward really made that show more than anyone else and Terry Carlwell it's actually where i
haven't seen the latest season yet but i do love the previous season say um they they do have uh
well they don't really have a like a repetitive theme that's the thing i can't really find that
like some um no but all the all the sticks are repetitive i think they're right out of stories at one
point though there's always uh that um that company which he uh signed up for the pyramid scheme
i i always want them to resolve that that's like something i just want to happen there's a list
of stuff they could fit they could just like address and boom yeah boom boom camera i haven't
watched in ages and i'm tired so have you watched some movie idioticity oh yeah not you Joe
I was asking oh yeah that was made felt honky oh honky you're asking idioticity look it up look it up
status documentary ever yeah pretty much my judge pulled it off the off of the rotation because he
said that i wasn't trying to make a documentary i was trying to make it satire
Terry Cruz is fabulous in it Terry Cruz is fabulous and then everything he wasn't that good
of a linebacker fair enough um gets i want to throw out get smart if you get a chance to watch
the original series of get smart it's one of the best i can stream that on Cody nobody remembers
who were the producers on that the producers wasn't that uh uh uh uh oh god damn it um it was
Mel Brooks and rock Henry that's it i knew well Brooks that's what i named my search of
you know i don't really recognize most of those names i i um only just like a kind of semi-young
person who um only recently actually started watching movies and stuff with uh stuff that's
more mainstream media stuff so you've never watched Mel Brooks movies i've heard of it might have
i didn't know well there are great Mel Brooks movies and there are sad Mel Brooks movies that's
very true you can't beat blazing saddles or young frankenstein oh i've i've watched blazing saddles
that's Mel Brooks uh yeah well then on that's a movie that could never be made today oh no it's great
it's a great movie yeah well depends on where it's made yeah seldom places it's not as much as a
problem as uh as in america yeah like we were talking about that before i've been talking for
well oh well i started at for me it's uh it was um a quarter past one i think yeah
quals are past one and it's now uh about ten past seven so yeah um it's being a while already
silent movie was a great movie but the the frustrating thing is i really wanted somebody to talk
i know it's called silent movie and i know it's it's supposed to be a peria and silent movies
but i really wanted somebody to talk oh yeah there was an episode in a show we were watching as family
and it was supposed to be like um well if not completely silent mostly silence because the guy who
it was focused on was dead dead so um uh it pretty quiet movie uh pretty quiet episode
but you just want someone to talk like if you just read like tech like all the sounds muffled and
detects this text explaining uh what the people are mouthing or signing then it's a bit like yeah
then it's something they just want someone to talk or something hi anxiety was fantastic
space balls i really did not like space balls really i've heard of it i thought they made a remake
then they it's sort of like robin hood men and tights they should have never made the movie
but then they should have never made uh robin hood prince of thieves either which is why he made the movie
exactly but that's but that's why it's enjoyable i mean it's it's stupid to the point where it's
fried and i love that movie well yeah it's a brightest thing that's a whole that's a whole
yeah we were not talking about princess bright no no but i just thought of it right yeah uh yeah i
love the the space balls because it's such a it's it it it makes so much fun of it but it's it's
just so fun i'm a maug half man half dog i'm my own best friend maybe we maybe i would get
a reference if i actually had watched it yeah so it was uh you know wookies that's something uh
that a parody of wookies and space balls called a maug which is east like i said he's half man
half dog uh yeah okay half man half dog
played by john candy president dwayne elizando mountain du camacho
law of words i guess you're lecture law of words uh going back to idiocracy of course yep
yeah rondo you know i i think blazing settles right it that i personally wouldn't find it that
bad if it would just be made in the modern time if it would be made today um i personally
wouldn't think it as a bad concept because um it not i'm not talking about remakes and just like
if the thing the original would be made in the modern day or would like modern uh
atmosphere i wouldn't personally find it bad but i think many people would misunderstand the meaning
behind the movie itself and therefore i think it's it's like um promoting racism or stuff and
we were talking earlier and um we noted that there's a lot more um focus on race and stuff in
america and that's very interesting i'm actually quite interested to know why specifically
and in america and what is there an equivalent of that in like europe that kind of dips into a whole
well of um yeah that's a it's a it's a it's a it's a dark muddy place that is hard to explain
and go over and try to uh thank you because there's a lot of people who have very very so this last
couple of years has shown that there has been a lot of people who have very strong feelings on either
side of many different conversations and they do not feel like that there's any reason why they should
ever you know try to find a happy middle ground to anything uh with that and with COVID in mind and
with other things and so anytime any of those subjects kind of get brought up you're going to find
where people sit on that and they just kind of they don't nobody nobody wants to find a happy
middle ground they all want to hold on middle ground very strong and the the whole conversation will
you know we'll just turn into a uh yeah that sucks uh not a conversation but just shouting match so
it's yeah you don't want to don't necessarily want to want but you know wait into the rounds get it
it all depends on your opinion the certain orange skinned credon it all depends on your
opinion on people's you know perceptions of things that are going on and people's perceptions of
everything and yeah uh is one right is the other right doesn't really matter there's there should
be a happy middle ground is there a right that this that's more like the questions people should be
asking like I'm sometimes astounded by how quickly people are to anger just I'm personally a very
just mellow chill person by nature but that just I am very old by your statement
I'm kidding I'm kidding I know what you say he said he was very angry by my statement
but yeah basically people usually just get that angry like about that kind of stuff when
the whole point of talking about it is not getting angry right and there should and there
should be that you know people should have a discussion and then things should go into place to
to uh the whole point of fix the problems but the problem is probably going to be angry yeah if
people are going to be angry well if people are if if they're if you can work it out together and
can finally compromise well maybe not everyone will be happy but at least everyone will be
equally frustrated at the solution and then we're all more equal and I think I think that's
isn't that a thing people want nowadays to be more equal to be equally frustrated I don't think so
well they're more equal then if if if you if the other person is more frustrated then
if the other person is more frustrated then eventually problems will arise that way and people
will complain and that kind of stuff if um you are more frustrated then you are more likely to
complain about it and that kind of stuff if both of you are equally frustrated and both
know that of the other people of the other person and you at least got to rip that like got got to
go to uh like um rip them off or something like that they you both the best way to have a compromise
is that both parties think they got the better deal that's actually it like if that doesn't work
then both parties have to be frustrated but if um the best the best compromise with people who don't
want to um see the other side is for them to both think they've won at the same time and because
they'll never talk to each other um they will not notice that um they've actually both have got
equals so or at least what what how much they're worth like equal to what they're worth basically
like um I wouldn't give like one person as much as uh a thousand people yeah got you yeah
my my point being that uh it's it's it's just a uh tough conversation to get into because
people's yeah yeah and again people are stupid that way yeah it's that it's it's that it's uh round
around here around here I think if uh if you've ever seen the I know you haven't but I
and if you ever looked at the uh some of the HBR mailing lists anytime there was uh something come
up about like COVID and um you know uh uh masks and backs and it's up like that a lot of that is
just it's it's shaky ground because people seem to to to stand firm on whatever they believe in
the yeah and it gets it no one wants to to kind of wait and wait into that middle ground at all
and try to find the compromise they all want to hold tightly onto whatever it is they believe so
we try to kind of yeah you know you touch on it a little bit like like in this situation and then
you just back away graceful yep yeah just thought that uh yeah that blazing settles isn't
actually I wouldn't think that that is uh something which would be too much of a problem subject matter
no uh were uh the wording that was used the the vocabulary that was used would not fly at all
maybe yeah yeah I haven't watched it in a long time I don't think yeah vocabulary but the underlying
