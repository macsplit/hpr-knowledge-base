Nice day to work today.
Ah, Hacker Public Radio on my podcast. Let's jump on the bike. Let's jump on the train.
This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4,196 from Monday the 2nd of September 2024.
Today's...
HPR Community News for August 2024 arrived.
One of my favorite shows. Come on, let's put it on.
They always like the fun and the banter they have.
Hello Dave, how are you? Over. I'm good.
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good. I keep forgetting to press this...
Show button. I should...
Yeah, Intro to Science Fiction Series by Ahuka.
I love seeing this coming in because it has my favorite word series in there.
And when Ahuka says series, Ahuka means series.
Oh yeah, interesting. Yeah, didn't see that show, but I have to see it.
Anyway, roller coaster.
Talks about software freedom.
Oh yeah, right. I interviewed Sam.
You're usually what you think about it. Hopefully the old software freedom day.
Big thing to take on.
Big thing to take on. Be responsible for our project. Something like software freedom day.
Especially. So good luck with that.
Yeah, it's quite a challenge I would think.
It's impressive. It's something I would...
If I had the time and stuff, I would help somebody else too.
But I know where would I initiate the thing myself.
I think it's too much.
I know, my name is roller coaster, but please don't show me like this.
Why? I mean, the whole thing of the recording was to prove that organizing software freedom day is easy.
It's a small thing to do. You don't have to go big.
You just ask over a few friends, have a small party or whatever.
You can go big.
I think he hates me. Can he hates me?
Ah, they hate me. They just want to sabotage.
Oh my god, I'm gonna... I'm gonna cancel software freedom day.
It needs to be done. No doubt about it.
Yeah, no doubt about it. And great stuff.
Come on now. Put your act together. Nobody's making fun of me.
They just... they have like a gazillion podcasts to listen.
I can't imagine they don't listen to everything.
They probably listened to the beginning, heard me talk about software freedom day worldwide.
And they missed the whole part about, okay, how...
As a small event, it can be really simple.
Just have two people over, have a talk, have a drink, have some beer.
And have a Linux install party.
Some people just are four or five people. That's okay.
Software freedom day doesn't have to be big.
Dave doesn't hate me.
Can doesn't make fun of me.
Don't think that like that, you're gonna come on.
Let's talk about software freedom.
Lovebug made this great episode about why he didn't record his podcast for hacker public radio.
And he explained how simple it is.
I mean, come on.
Software freedom day is simple too. Just do it.
Ask four friends over, have some fun to have a talk about what free software you use.
You can do it with new people and explain them or give them a demo.
And do it with old people and get some more in-depth knowledge.
But I mean, software freedom day is too important to win over stuff, to go all drama.
And okay, my name is Rollercoaster, but I like the name.
And maybe I trolled you a little bit now.
Anyway, thanks for keeping organizing the podcast.
My HPR is like my connection with hackers all over the world.
And Ken and Dave, you're the guys who glue everything together.
For how much episodes now?
Two years? Three years? No, it wasn't more.
A little bit more. I think 20 or something.
Anyway, I don't care.
Thanks a lot. I've been enjoying it. I will still enjoy it.
And I hope you didn't mind getting small a little bit.
But come on, let's have fun. We'll get a thanks a lot.
And see you around. Bye.
