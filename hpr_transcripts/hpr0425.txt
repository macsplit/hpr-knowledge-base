Hello and welcome to Hacker Public Radio for your, this is probably coming out on a
Wednesday.
My name is Dave and I'll be your host today and what will probably be a brief Hacker
Public Radio.
Just a couple of quick little tips or tricks, things that you may not know, they're not
earth shattering by any stretch imagination but one of these I didn't know and the other
one maybe not a lot of people have thought about possibly.
Anyway, if this episode seems a little noisy compared to the others is because I am recording
this while mobile, normally my podcasting studio of choice is a Honda Civic but I went
for a job interview yesterday, I have a job, I'm not really looking for a job but an opportunity
came up and while at this job interview the VP of sales at this company backed into
my Honda Civic in the parking line, I was still being interviewed and when I walked
out there was a guy standing at a door and he said that he was getting ready to make
my day significantly more crappy and I said house that and he said well I just backed
into your car.
So that was the first for me, it was funny and awkward all at the same time so because
of that I am recording on a day when the temperature is probably close, well that's
really 95 but I am recording this in a 93 Chevrolet work truck, this is a long bed work
truck, it is actually a work truck, it's got a WT, it's got 128,000 miles on it but
to look at it you wouldn't think so, you would think it had maybe 328,000 miles on it.
Most of the paint has come off so it's two or three toned, it's white, it's Primer
Gray and it's rust color but this truck has served me well although it gets about 13 miles
per gallon and the air condition has a mind of its own, it runs but it may blow out hot
air, it may blow out cold air so while you're sitting in the comfort of whatever listening
environment you're sitting in just know that I'm recording this with no air conditioner
so just be glad you can't smell this episode.
Anyway I am rambling so I will start.
The first quick tip is about tap mix plus, now I'm not going to say hey here's a tip
use tap mix plus, I've been using tap mix plus it's a Firefox extension that feature
files, yeah I made that word up that adds some features to the tabs in Firefox, it does
some things, it adds some session management that allows you to do some things with tabs
you couldn't normally do or make things easier to do with the tabs that you, that the
file installation of Firefox may not allow you to do quite so easily, move tabs duplicate
tabs, there's different things, it's one of those extensions really that you don't
even know that you have run it unless you use some of the features, it's less useful
now than it used to be because Firefox as of late has been adding some of these features
that were in this extension, but I'm a long time Firefox tab mix plus user and it was
just yesterday that I realized that I had this feature, now I'm not trying to drag this
out but I'm not even sure if control tab is a tab mix plus feature not, I don't think
it is, I think that's a normal Firefox feature, you can switch between tabs by, so like
alt tabing windows you can control tab web pages in tabs on, in Firefox, but with tab
mix plus, in the settings for tab mix plus, so up in the menu is probably tools options
or tools tab mix plus, I think it works at the menu, but find your tab mix plus options
dialog and go there and there to be an events tab and under that the events button, there's
a row of buttons at the top and one of them says events I think and under the events settings
dialog there's a tab on the far right assist tab features and in there's two radio boxes
you can click, the first one that you want to click says control tab displays a tab list
menu, pop up menu, control tab displays a tab list pop up menu, check that one and you can
also check the one below it that says tab list response to the mouse, what this will do after
you hit apply and okay is when you control tab you will get a pop up list of the windows that
are open and I think the list is populated or the window that pops up, the top of that
window is wherever your mouse cursor is, but you can use your scroll wheel or you can move the
mouse or the arrow keys anyone to select one of those, so instead of having control tabbing
till you get to the tab you're looking for, you can pop up a list, it's pretty seamless,
it's actually pretty handy, I think it's just one of those things that allows, puts a little bit
more information in front of your house when you control tab and says not like you're just
doing it until you get there, you can see where you're going or get there quicker, the other
thing I wanted to mention real quick, this is a tiny little tip too, is grip, we don't know what
grip is, but grip has a color option, it's sort of like list has a color option, you can add this
to your Bash RC file or Bash underscore profile file, just do an export space grip, that's capital
grip, underscore capital options, that's all caps with underscore, so export space, all caps with
underscore between the words grip options equals single quote dash dash color equals auto in single
quote, or you can just alias the in your Bash RC file, grip equals single quote, grip the
space dash dash color equals auto in single quote, or you can pass that option on the command
line as well, and what that will do is it will highlight, I think the default is red, in color,
the item you search for in the line that grip returns, that may or may not be useful, that's
one of those things that if it's not enabled by default, which I don't think any districts do,
maybe I don't think you need to, maybe Gentoo does, but it may be something you've never thought of,
anyway that is a short hacker ported radio episode, if you didn't like this episode do something
about it, besides complaining, get up and do one of your own, we do these things five days a week,
and platoon or enigma, the admin at hpr.org, I'm sure is the email address or something like that,
send some email, send them some audio, people are star for better content than I provide,
so please join in the hacker ported radio community of contributors, don't just be a consumer,
okay, so that has been hacker ported radio tune in again tomorrow for even better content.
