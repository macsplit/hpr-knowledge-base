Greetings, everyone.
This is Coug Moe, and today I'd like to talk to you about my 4A into BINARO recording.
From the book of knowledge, BINARO recording is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones arranged with the intent to create a 3D stereo sound sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers or instruments.
This effect is often created using a technique known as dummy head recording, where an American head is outfitted with a microphone in each ear.
BINARO recording is intended for replay using headphones and will not translate properly over stereo speakers.
So, if you're not listening to it with headphones, which I know most of you are, go grab your headphones now.
I actually started this project quite a while ago. I went down a radio shack and picked up a bag of microphone elements, opened up the package, got out my multimeter, hooked up each one individually, tapped the table, recorded the level that I got from my multimeter.
Grab two that were the same, and then wired those into a pair of old headphones, facing out from the ear, of course, and then checked them to make sure that I was receiving sound from each element.
Then that project got put in a drawer and was forgotten about. I kind of played with it a little bit plugged into a laptop, but it's kind of hard to pack a laptop around with you to do recordings.
Then my dear wife, the one who must be obeyed, got me a Zoom H1 handy recorder for my birthday, and it has a line-in jack.
So, of course, the first thing I did was plug in my binoral headphones and did some playing, and I'd like to have you listen to a little bit of that now. Thank you.
