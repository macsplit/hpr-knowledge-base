This is Hacker Public Radio episode 4218 for Wednesday the 2nd of October 2024.
Today's show is entitled Crazy Battery Story.
It is hosted by Swift 110 and is about 9 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, got the wrong batteries and had to walk to get the right ones.
Hello everybody.
This is Swift 110.
Tonight I thought I would share a rather humorous story with you guys.
Story story Monday night.
I had the idea of getting a universal remote control of TV in my hotel.
I have been a bunch of hotels for work since July.
And the vision of the TV is just saved.
I know my laptop.
I got a HVMI cable.
But generally the TV is in my hotel.
Don't give me the option to switch.
So I always use it.
Fast forward a little bit.
I walked down to the swamp right from the security room.
I loved my room.
And with the universal remote.
That from its I've seen it.
It's got a TV I've seen the note for about 10 bucks.
It's got the button time needed.
And so get the remote control.
Get back to my return.
Just to realize that.
Man I am dead.
Oh, what a foul.
So I'm like, I'll get batteries and like that.
Up above the ground.
And through all my metal.
This time I didn't go the way much.
I didn't directly change.
Okay, let me just leave.
So I left work, walked from there for a while.
Got tired.
I got to go out for the rest of the day.
We didn't know enough you did.
And so then I decided to go to the dollar store.
I said, I like that.
I think that's a battery.
And you go back to my hotel.
And you get me to be with it.
That's all.
That's a great.
Well, paying for the Uber to get two dollars per word.
Getting the bad, you know, trying to get batteries.
But they were mislabeled in the wrong area.
Supposedly the brand name battery.
With five dollars.
It was a paper.
Almost just a penny.
So I got the at-finity.
But I managed to get the long batteries.
A triple A instead of double A.
It's all over again.
Is anybody home at five?
I was just wondering.
Seriously, how do you do it?
You just pay $20 for two chips.
You know, so the goal of kicking up these batteries.
Like, you gotta, you gotta like pick this right.
Why don't you just bring the thing with you?
So anyway.
I decided to walk.
This time I just went to Walmart.
I was not coming back to the golf store.
That's further done in the Walmart.
So I was about to make matters worse.
Regarding originally being at the dollar store.
Right next door to it was a five and below.
So yeah.
This guy going from the dollar store to the five and below.
That actually picks up another USB-C cable.
USB-C to USB-A cable.
Free.
Not a problem, right?
Okay.
Well, I don't get the right size battery.
It's like I had three chances to get the right batteries.
I could have just got one that was triple-A, one that was double-A.
And managed to just, oh, just need to trip away.
It's an old tellroom.
Okay.
That's when you back up and go back to the future.
Well, it's in the Walmart.
Pick up a whole box of, uh, double-A batteries.
The hotel.
Parked batteries in the Walmart.
Turn up TV on.
Clickbait.
Click over.
That's the button.
Go over to the edge of my sign.
On by the being by the building.
Now TV in this hotel room.
It's by the way, it's a 4K TV.
We have a 20-21.
I'm estimated it could be of our 55th city.
This is a really nice TV.
TV.
I'm used to giving a photo to the edge.
720 TV.
So this was, I had to have been out in the hotel.
I'm glad to be here.
So what's going on?
I'm going to get that done in such a way that, uh,
I've been enjoying that ever since.
So, you know, what's going to get me into a partner?
One of the things that I already have been wanting to be for quite some time
is to actually get a TV.
I've got self-analysis as it is.
But I don't, I'm bigger monitor.
And it's a fairly long that has at least a bit of experience.
We do not.
Although I'm sure there's always, you didn't have to go somewhere.
It's your mock fort decided life.
But there was some kind of background.
Same kind of background.
Port for that community there.
Yeah, a little bit that secure.
A little bit of some time.
I'm just really looking forward to having that.
I might you don't want it to be in my catering.
But I'm not going to go too long to do that.
I don't know how long.
I've never found out how long before.
It just becomes unusable.
There's a bar for rent.
Maybe it's in my catering.
I don't know.
I couldn't even bother anything like that.
So that ain't it.
This is all I'm going to do.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to put some context up for you.
A minute.
A minute.
A minute and a half.
This should be told to me.
A message.
No matter.
Yeah.
I could be at some point.
You've got some hope.
That you can reach on what?
A lot of emails.
That's faithy, faith.
What does?
You used to keep this under 10 minutes.
You take this round around.
You don't need it.
But I know.
This ball had for tribute something to agriculture.
Public radio.
I haven't done it in a while.
I can't tell you how to keep this place going.
And by the way,
you guys feel free to contribute.
What you've got to say.
You know, really thank you've gone in the world of technology.
What can you share with us?
You know, I share my blender with God in some batteries.
I'm looking at Joe, but not.
But, you know, share similar speeds.
It's a hacker public radio.
There's a volunteer around.

And we'll continue to go on as long as people contribute to the project.
If you've a stock contributing to it,

Don't need to be nothing complicated.
It could be a long thing.
It could be a few minutes.
But you look forward to hearing from me.
All right.
It'll be about this.
