This is Haka Public Radio Episode 3493 for Wednesday, 22nd of December 2021, today's show
is entitled, My First Panish HDR Episode, It is hosted by Claudio Miranda, and is about
5 minutes long, and carries a clean flag. The summary is, a short Panish episode inspired
by discussions about non-English episodes on the HDR mailing list.
Hi people from Haka Public Radio, my name is Claudio Miranda, I know myself as Claudio M in the
different place and in several other places online. I wanted to record this episode because in the mailing list,
I know you were talking about some good recordings in other languages, so I think it's a good idea
to put it in the main list for podcasts. So I said, well, I'm going to have a short
short talk in my other language, which is not my first language, my first language is English, but the second is
Castellano or Spanish, so I said, well, I'm going to record this. I thought it was a good idea and I hope
that many people like it in their own language, and I say it because we are hackers that we speak
English, we are from several countries, we are from several different places, so I think it would be a good idea to do this.
And the one that I'm not interested in, I can't understand it, I mean, I can't skip it, I can't pass it
forward and not listen to it, or listen it, and for curiosity, to listen to how it sounds,
talking about it in its main language, its main language of roots, so I'm going to talk a little
about that. First, I know that there are many people who are thinking of where I am, maybe I don't have it
very strong in the accent, but I am born here in the United States, but my parents are
from Argentina, specifically from Mendoza, so no, I speak with them like that in Spanish or in
Castellano, and well, my dad, at least, my mother made it, but with them I always spoke in Spanish
in Castellano, and well, also what I inspired me to record this, also what I had
talked about in the English, there are about reactions that are not in English, I have been listening to
a podcast called the Texto Plano podcast, which is a podcast called Texto Guillaume Plano.exe
So, there are several topics like software, and hack-activism, and there are many other
things from technology too, very interesting, and there are many people there, I know that there is one
that is called, well, it is the F-Fuentes, which I told you, but there are also other people in the
podcast, one that is going through the name Per√≥n, online, the two are in
in SDF, SDF, then and they are also in the Ferryversa, in Mastodavana, or wherever.
There are other people who are also in those podcasts, and quite interesting, but it is the only
podcast that I have found, I know that there are certainly many, but it is the only one that I
find, first and the only one that I have found that talk about these topics that I am interested in,
like, similar to how the hacker public radio, but everything in Castellano, so if you want to check it,
if you want to hear it, you can go to the Texto Plano page, which is HTTP, that
is the Texto guionplano.exe and grayaceta, okay, then this recording, I hope that it was not
very complicated, first time I record something like this in Spanish, in Spanish, Castellano,
as they want to say here, here in the United States we always say Spanish, so I know that
Castellano, more than where we are, we are the Argentinians, and also in Uruguayos,
that area, but well, I hope that they have enjoyed this and well, I hope to hear
recordings in other languages from here in front, well, a greeting and a big hug,
bye, until next time.
