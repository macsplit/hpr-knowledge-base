You're right.
You're right.
This is Clat 2 and I'm at the Southeast Linux Fest with right now DualCore.
Is DualCore the band or the person?
DualCore is actually the group.
It's myself and Dadey, I'm the rapper and then my producer is C64 who lives in Manchester
England and joined with us today is our special guest Remington Forbes.
Cool.
So hi, DualCore.
Hello.
What's going on?
So, do you guys make music about what, Linux or Geeksza for both, all of the above?
All of the above.
So, we've got songs that really run the gamut.
My name is Dadey, comes from the of course the assembly call in Linux on X86 architecture.
So, we of course cover Linux and our topic.
We got songs about Star Wars, Mega Man.
You name it, we very well may have wrapped about it.
Right, okay.
How and when did you get started?
Well, I used to freestyle when I was in college and Remi and I were at a conference, not a
concrete in Cleveland and we were at this room party and somebody was like, hey, there's
someone here from Cincinnati that can rap.
And so I thought there was somebody else from Cincinnati, but they turned out they were
talking about us.
So, we just started rapping about the stuff we do day to day with technology and everything
and everybody really loved it.
Okay.
What did you go to school for?
What was programmers or what, computer scientists?
I went to school now to attend it for computer network engineering.
Okay.
But he's a phys admin and a network engineer, a network admin and his job and then I went
to school for computer science and ID security.
How much time do you think, I mean, it probably varies, like when you're gearing up for an
album it's probably more, but I mean how much time do you have to spend on making music
every day or week or whatever?
Definitely not a whole lot.
I mean, my job keeps a good number of hours going every week, but I have a very understanding
girlfriend who lets me record it after she's gone to sleep, or if I need to skip out
on something we've got planned because I need to get a track done for an album or something
like that, she's really understanding stuff.
That's cool.
It's hard to put a quantity on the number of hours per week.
Right.
I mean, I would say in the past week, I've probably logged a good 20 to 30 hours working
on our latest album.
And what is the latest album?
Is it out yet?
Not yet.
It's going to be definitively titled next level and we're planning to release it next
month.
Our initial projected release date with Steph Kahn, though our listeners might get a surprise
and we might be able to release it a little bit earlier than that.
Just, I mean, on the technical end of things, like are you a hardware based mostly or are
you doing this on a Linux like digital audio workstation or I mean how kind of describe
for me like I guess how digital all comes about?
Yeah.
So I've got a condenser mic in my basement that I just bought at Guitar Center and I just
raffened it out.
It runs into my desktop and then that records the vocals and I STPM up to my producer and
he takes him and dumps him into his mix of the background music that he's made and then
he goes to work from there.
Wow.
That's great.
So also, Remi and I are involved with 2600 in Cincinnati.
I was going to ask about that actually.
Yeah.
I forgot.
We meet once a month and we cover all kinds of topics.
We started out mainly focused on security.
I did a lot of application security presentations and how to hack this, how to exploit that.
But the groups are really grown and we have a wide range of interest now in the group.
So it's pretty cool.
That's cool.
Where do you guys meet?
Yeah.
Let me ask.
We're out.
Yes.
Just like a restaurant or something.
Yeah.
We're out.
It's like a bar.
It's like a bar and a half.
Yes.
An actual smell.
I guess like confitron.
Yeah, they have like a background.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Three, five, nine.
And they're really good.
I mean, we've been meeting there for three years.
And like the owner knows us.
She's really nice and they're happy to have us there.
Cool.
Unfortunately, we've kind of been getting like bigger attendance at the meetings as of late.
I mean, that's a good thing.
That's it.
So it's fortunate.
But unfortunate, it kind of fills the room that we're in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some of our guys have been working on getting a hacker space set up.
Wow.
And they've just been working in the past couple of months.
But they just signed their 501-C3 papers the other day.
Wow.
Got a bank account set up.
And I think they're closing on the space that we're going to get like to lie first.
I think that's fantastic.
So it's awesome.
So I think we might be worth 2600 meetings to the hacker space since then adding out.
Wow.
That's really cool.
I mean, the 2600 in where I live is like three to ten people.
Yeah.
But it just got started back up.
I guess it used to be more of a college.
It would happen in a college.
And then that kind of died down as people graduate, stuff like that.
But yeah, it's neat to hear about one that's like actually growing and growing out of where it was supposed to be.
That's really cool.
Yeah.
And we're very fortunate because we're actually the new generation of our 2600 Cincinnati.
I remember going to a meeting of the previous generation.
And there was.
They're all about phone freaking.
And stuff like that that we don't really have an idea of anymore, right?
Right.
Well, actually not to knock anybody from our previous generation tonight, but they didn't seem to be about anything.
They all came to the meeting.
They were all in this place and then they all just got on IRC.
Yeah.
And they didn't do any presentations.
They didn't talk about anything.
Yeah.
They just all did the same thing that they do at home.
So I was like, what?
I don't understand.
Like 2600 is kind of a time to like geek out and show everybody else what you're geeked about.
Right.
It was kind of weird.
That we got now like they're real cool.
We come and we do, you know, monthly topics or monthly presentation and all that stuff.
I see we got to do with the 2600 Blue Box shirt right there.
There you go.
Right on, man.
Do you want to have a listen to some horror music?
Yeah.
Let me tell her out.
So you are a rapper as well or you're doing music or both?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean like the music music.
Oh, you're talking about the production.
Yeah.
I'm just a rapper.
Okay.
I don't do, I don't do producing anything like that.
Yeah.
I don't know these terms.
So I always think of...
They're kind of like a few things.
Yeah.
You're like, yes.
Are you trying to say rappers on that?
Yeah.
No.
That's...
Yeah.
I forget that in the rap community.
For music is like the actual...
Actual beat beats and melody.
Yeah.
In the background.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
So the person doing all the music is actually a England?
In England.
Yeah.
Wow, that's crazy.
Now how did you meet up with...
I mean like you guys meet each other online or something?
Yeah, I just met him on an underground hip-hop forum.
And...
No.
That was it.
I liked his stuff and he seemed to like my stuff.
Yeah.
He said, hey, do you want to do an album?
And I said, yeah, but this is what I want to do it about.
And he said, okay.
Wow.
He's a graphic designer.
So he's a nerd too.
Yeah, yeah.
He's like, yeah, that's cool.
It just kind of strikes me that...
Can I get you an album?
Yeah.
I've been doing...
I've been doing geeky stuff.
It can take a long time.
I'm sure.
Or it seems like geeky.
It could be very absorbing.
I'm just wondering how you pry yourself away from making the music and also sitting in front
of the computer staring at that, which is a string full of code being compiled or something.
I'm actually a packet capturing right now.
Oh, okay.
I can't help it.
I'm just wondering if you can pull out people's user names and passwords.
Cool.
Yeah.
Well, I guess with me, the music part comes...
Really, when I do music and I write, and I write lyrics, I kind of draw some draw from
my stances with, you know, with acting or anything technology related.
So it kind of comes a little bit easier.
So it's almost...
I mean, it's kind of like a blog.
I mean, not to be little, it's kind of like a blog.
I consider writing a blog.
You're like, you make a song about it.
Yeah.
And we're awesome.
Yeah.
That's a good analogy, I like that.
I mean, that's because that's what I mean, I don't wrap.
But I will blog just random stuff because I'm like, I'll spend an hour trying to figure something
out.
It'll work.
Yeah.
And I'll go online and just like quickly just blog almost just to kind of get the experience
down.
But also so that someone can, you know, follow up on it and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Apologies to the listeners because we're like at the dual core table and so people come up
and so you...
It's kind of...
Yeah.
Kind of crazy here, actually.
I mean, people are just...
Oh, man.
They've been speaking of which.
Yeah.
So why do you think people would come to a conference like this and not tunnel via SSH?
They don't have better.
Yeah?
Sure.
I mean, I've been to hacker conferences.
People blogging into Facebook.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see that stuff all the time.
Yeah.
Pop 3 and I'm at it and they don't...
They just don't know.
Yeah.
Is it a big deal?
For instance, if I log into my Facebook, I'm not tunneling.
I log into my Facebook.
I mean, big deal.
I mean, I'm fake name, fake name, random password that I don't use anywhere else.
No big deal, right?
But I think a lot of people that use a password for Facebook also use it elsewhere.
Yeah.
I'm not guilty of that.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean, either.
So you're both actually working in network industry.
Are you...
Are you seeing a lot of...
I mean, are you living in Linux even on the job?
Or is there a lot of...
Yeah.
Yeah.
I work at a data center.
So we also have a lot of Linux servers.
So I deal with Linux on a day of Linux.
What's a run Linux?
Maybe if you make a run.
Right.
Cool.
What's the obligatory...
What distro do you run?
Debian.
Debian at home.
Debian.
Yeah.
And our random...
Debian.
Ah, okay.
And Debian.
Lots and lots of Debian.
Also Debian.
Which...
Are you running the new one?
The...
Linux?
Or are you on state or something?
I think I...
I'm running.
I'm running.
I'm running.
Yeah.
Linux for Remi and...
Without even knowing, you just run.
Right.
Ready for Remi.
It's natural.
You become a geek and you suddenly become...
I'm on Linux on my EPC, but I've got a sin repository.
I normally run unstable because it's got all the need to stop.
And it's really not unstable.
It's not unstable.
It's not that unstable.
That's what I...
I ran...
I sit on my triveley for a couple of months.
And yeah, I was like...
I mean, I'm used to...
I mean, some of the fedora unstable stuff is really unstable.
Like, when they say it's unstable, I mean it.
But on Linux...
I mean, I'm sick.
It seems like...
You can get by really well.
Yeah.
And I've run Debian on a stable for years and I mean...
It's definitely my choice.
Yeah.
My preference, I should say.
Where can they find out about you guys?
