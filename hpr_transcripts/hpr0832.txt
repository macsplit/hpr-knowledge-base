Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon today. I want to give you a roundup of Ogcamp 11.
In today's interview, we're going to be talking to Stuart Lammage from the canonical
and formerly of LogRadio. Les Porter to give us behind the scenes talk, but also a roundup.
I had an interview with Les afterwards. We also talked to AID from, also from the LogRadio
podcast as well as putting in guest appearances on the Linux Outlaws from time to time.
We spoke to Laura and Poppy as well and then we have one of our own Robin
Gatling from the full cervical podcast. All that more in today's show. Hope you enjoyed.
Hello everybody, my name is Ken Fallon. I'm talking to Les Porter, who's just come down here into
booth. He's about, looks like a man under a bit of stress. How are you doing Les?
I'm fine, thanks. A lot of stress all today, so it's very busy here at Ogcamp.
From what I can tell is about 200 plus people here today. It's quite a lot.
There's a lot of people. The venue is great as well. There's plenty of space, big rooms for the
talks, lovely exhibition area, lots of fantastic cafe, just outside where everyone's congregating
and getting together to talk about projects. So you had this when you were involved in the previous
shows? I was involved in Ogcamp previously in Liverpool, running the Ubuntu Install Fest with
Stuart Ward and Ajaz Muhammad. Similar to what Alistair and Rose doing here today with the Install
Fest. Yeah, previous to that 2009, I was just attendee coming to see what it was like.
It's a bit infectious, all right. The whole feel, you can't help but want to get involved.
So, what exactly are you, what's your goal, what's your heart are you wearing here today?
My heart today is crew manager, so I'm making sure that we've got crew doing the jobs that
need doing, everything runs smoothly and that the presenters don't need to worry about a thing.
Okay, and how many people are on the crew? 20 plus, we've had a couple of additions today,
last minute additions, just walking. So, roughly 20-22 people all doing various jobs from
AB equipment with cameras and mixing desks, reception desks people, people selling mugs and
raffle tickets, people walking around answering questions, everything you can think of.
Yeah, it's been a must, it's been absolutely fabulous here with the show we've had.
Any request has been fulfilled in five minutes. I brought the wrong power card,
while I brought an adapter, but that doesn't work and within five minutes I had a new cable,
microphone stands, everything organised. So, I'm really enjoying the show. How is the booking system
working now? Well, camp plan manager, it's working well, there's a few niggles, we found a book today
with partner software, which we're going to report to the guy who created camp plan manager,
John Sprix. We'll let him know this book and I'm sure he'll be very accommodating.
Is John here? He's not, no, he's looking after his son Daniel this weekend.
Oh, that's, yeah, Sprix, because I would love to meet him, I owe him a beer from the past.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a HBR show on today, so we'll try again in the morning.
Brilliant! Okay, so just before we round up, I'm going to ask you one to set to the listeners.
If you're interested in our camp, go to the website opcamp.org,
have a look and see what's happening today and also future events.
Also keep an eye on Linux Outlaws website and once the UK for more information about future
at op camps. It's been absolutely fabulous, thank you very much for putting on the show,
and thank you to you and all the crew for a great job that you're doing here.
I'm really looking forward to getting here with behind the scenes and up at opcamp.org
and I'm just not steered language, you'll know him as AC from Log Radio. How's it going steered?
Oh, not too bad, I'm not sure I'm me from Log Radio anymore, we haven't done Log Radio for a while.
What about Episode 6?
Well, the fact that we did a recent episode count not.
So how are you? How are you enjoying the show? How's it going so far?
So far it's really cool, I've not been here very long, but op camps just so nicely put together
and professionally, it's really quite entertaining, come here being on the other side of things for once.
And I like the fear of it, I like the way it's set up and I get to see a bunch of people
I don't get to see very often, so it's all cool.
I find it interesting to me a lot of these people had only met online and then all of a sudden
you're sitting at breakfast with a guy from Punchbang or you're walking down the hall
and you know somebody who you listened to every week is suddenly there in person.
I think that's exactly the point of confidence really, you can't need the UK does need
a conference like this and op camp pays to be filling that need, which is great.
A need that was started by Log Radio many, many years ago.
Oh well, maybe.
I remember I was at the first and second Log Radio and it was a scary feeling coming up
to the doors of a conference like this and then you walk in and everybody's so friendly
and everybody gets on and like here at the booth I've had loads of people come up and just go,
yeah I'll do it and talk about my project.
It's a really good way to get people get interested in all the people's projects and stuff.
That's exactly the idea, you know, you want people to come somewhere like this and
hang out with, I'll be able to make connections and talk to people who work on the projects that
they use or the things that they hack on or just stuff they like.
I think you're as part of the work in Ubuntu, I guess you get around to different conferences
in the States or here in Europe and I would just say that those more formal ones would
compare to an event like this.
Different kind of vibe. A formal conference is primarily, primarily designed to be about
learning something from experts. So the people who are speaking are renowned in their field
and your idea is to go along and listen and go away having learned something.
Something like, yes absolutely the people here are experts, they're talking about stuff that
they love, but to me it's more, something like Altcamp is more about hanging out with people
rather than being given information by them. Now most conferences have that feeling as well,
I mean only very very very formal business conferences have no social aspect,
but Altcamp, the Altcamp pendulum tends to swing more towards the social end of the spectrum
and a more formal more expensive conference, swings a bit more towards the learning end.
Excellent and how is your work called? Do you want to one project, how's that going for you?
Actually, excellent, we just announced that we've just gone over a million users.
Ubuntu and it's going from strength to strength which is great and we've got the Windows
client is in beta and we're doing a bunch stuff on the web, we've got music streaming now on
Android and iOS and it's all good. And is this restricted to Ubuntu or can somebody on
Fedora and other distra start using? Absolutely, the client's all written in Python or VALA.
We've certainly had a couple of people interested in packaging the stuff up for
Fedora or for Arch or for whatever and there's no reason why it wouldn't run. We haven't done that work
and it's not as high on offer until this is some other stuff but we're certainly happy to give
some pointers, help anybody who wants to do it and as I say we've had a few people step up,
be interested in packaging and running Ubuntu and stuff on deviant on Fedora. I know there's been
those too and I think there are a couple of others. What would you say to say one of my biggest
fears with storing stuff on the cloud is the ability for somebody else to access us so I would
prefer an encrypted solution on the cloud. Is that something that I could use Ubuntu 1 as a
basis for and then in some way mounted as an SSHFS drive with encryption built in or something like that?
Well, you can absolutely encrypt the data that you store in Ubuntu 1 if you want to.
Just encrypt the files and then signal to Ubuntu 1 they'll be encrypted and they'll stay
encrypted. We have had a couple of people who want to work with Ubuntu's encrypted home
directory stuff so as I understand it the way that works is what seems to be your home directory
is actually a mounted thing and what's actually your home directory under the cover is a big
bunch of encrypted files so you could make those encrypted files be synchronized to Ubuntu 1
at which point everything just works seamlessly the stuff that's stored in the cloud will be encrypted
the stuff that's on your machine will be available to you so if you want to do that you could do
a few people have asked us about this and we've said we believe this will work we haven't tried it
but we'd if someone wants to do a bit of work on that write something out find out about it come
and ask us questions I'd be really interested in seeing the results of that so what I
and that's a topic for another day and hack about the gradient thank you very much
Jack for for giving us the interview and I hope you enjoy the rest of the show
for measures a familiar host here and it is welcome coming from the full circle podcast to
mainly on syndicate and periscope and how's it going it's very good thank you so I wanted to do
a ride I got him for the introduction this morning first thing just sat through Simon Fitt's
excellent talk on software freedom and Karen's unscheduled but nonetheless very good talk on
medical devices oh fantastic um so are you recording the shows I've recorded both the sessions
so far and I shall be talking to a few people around the conference over the next couple of days
so yes expect a couple of shows from us once I've got it all back together and edited later on
so what is to your editing tools and one thing I must say is that the quality of the editing puts my
tools to show so talk to us about how you edit you feel I put everything through audacity
fairly traditional I have a fairly traditional background because I used to do traditional
analog editing for theatre so I go through pretty much the same process on the digital front I'm
multi-tracking cutting and splicing and I have fab disease if you listen to Fabian from limits
limits out laws episode 200 where he talks about his editing process I'm just as obsessive
about my audio quality as he is so it takes me far too long in audacity to cut and splice and
clean everything up but I think that if I don't put the care and attention into producing the show
why should anybody actually listen to it because we're focused because we're learning
well then folks you you know that the series on how to edit the podcast is being
called also the podcast is based on syndicate with person so hopefully we put that in on
the special how to record a show to make it a little bit more accessible from the main page
so we're looking forward to the most here today I think the highlights for me
have always been listening to the live shows that have come from previous op camps so I'm going
to sit in the main hall and watch the mayhem unfold hopefully there'll be a few good discussion
topics coming up and we can watch the the outlaws and the you can see folks maybe with a bit of help
from Stuart who's here from lab radio and like the old Monty Python sketch we'll find a good room
for an argument excellent thank you very much for stopping by thank you
hello you've got some nice things to look at for camp for you I don't know managed to
call an island hall who I didn't recognize last night in the park so I don't know how you do
that's fine I'll get you back later you can buy me a drink that's fine that is the intention yes
yes go well yes loads of people here some good interesting talks from some cool people like
Simon Fitz and Karen is the head of the known foundation this guy talking about music he
was talking about digital forensics it's all kinds of stuff it's really cool did you have any idea
when we started did you want to UK podcast that you know it would turn out like those people
playing in from all over the world just to be here okay no I kind of thought that when we first
started it was kind of thought that we'd just have a bunch of guys chatting around at a room and
you know maybe a few people might download it and listen to it and I never thought it would come
into the real world of actually you know meeting people in person and people coming here to talk to
other people and you know have conversations with like-minded people it's yeah it's quite it's quite
bizarre now how it's moved on in the last three four years yeah and do you find it very stressful at
all or I just let everyone else do the work you know no yeah it is stressful I mean in terms of
you in the podcast and we have a workflow now we've been doing it four seasons now we've got a
workflow that works for us we've split the work up between us because there's four presenters we
you know we we're able to divvy work up between us something someone like yourself where you're
doing everything like well well in this instance you are like holding the microphone and talking to
me and you know pimping everything whereas you know right now with you BC I'm standing here and
someone else is doing some work somewhere you know and I'm not so having having multiple people
really helps us to like divvy the work out yeah I didn't realize how much work the crew did
initially I thought you know in the first uh okay um we would turn up and we'd have to do everything
and and kind of get the the to be errand boys going off and doing the stuff for us but actually
it turns out you know they use their own initiative they go off and get stuff done and they just know
what you know you should be done to make this whole thing work it's really really good yeah
excellent I would just say it compares to other conferences um uh it's I don't know some people
might say it's this professional you know it's a bit more ad hoc it's uh um you know it's not as polished
um I think a bit more community driven and I and I think the the fact that you know people take
it on themselves to choose what they want to talk about and come along and help organize things
means that it's not about because it's not okay it was a union PC and Lilix Outlaws they've got
together to make this and then happen but it's not about everyone else who comes here and
and the fact that people come along to do their their their talks and show off their um their
interesting projects and and sell their wares in our exhibition areas just fantastic yeah it's
great it's really good so what are you looking forward to coming up um I've missed one of the talks
so I'm a bit annoyed at that uh not because I'm talking to you uh but there there's a couple of
talks that I missed but the really cool thing is this year we're videoing every single one of them
once we've got the mission of the person uh we're videoing them all and we've got a little edit
suite out of the back and they're and they're uploading them so actually I'm less stressed about
you know rushing around from Romeroon to another because I know that I can see them later on but
I certainly want to see the one on digital forensics as well I'm interested to know about
Oracle Linux as well as I talk about Oracle Linux and I'm interested about IPv6 as well so
and and the great thing is I can see these later offline it's fantastic there's a great selection
of talks uh to miss unfortunately you can get the history on Romeroon so we'll have to do that tomorrow
okay so anything else you want to say to the listeners um where's it going to be next year
if it's the question haha yeah thanks for that uh so the first one was in Wolverhampton the
next one was in Liverpool uh down south this year in Farnham I would love to see one somewhere completely
wildly different you know whether it's somewhere in the back and beyond in Scotland or in a completely
different country yeah I I'm like to see somewhere else you know because I think we've covered
like North and South England it's nice to go have somewhere else there we are doesn't it
I don't know all right come on that's up to the place okay thanks very much
okay thank you I look forward to buying your beer tonight oh I look I very much look forward to drinking it
hello everybody my name is Kampon you're just in front of the radio we have scenes here at
on camera just uh walk past eight how you doing I'm doing good thanks what talks did you get to see
um so this morning I went to the message queuing one that seemed pretty interesting um as for
yesterday I can't remember what to also into but uh the live show was a lot of fun that was great
so um what I'd like um you know you've organised a lot of these what's it like being on the other side
of the table well you've been very generous because I didn't do a great deal of organising for
a radio to be quite honest but uh yeah it's nice to be somewhere where you don't have anybody
asking you you know where should it be going what should it be doing so yeah just sitting back
as a participant is really nice and uh this place is so well organised compared to anything that
we ever put on you know it's unbelievable I know I think you're uh it is well organised so
let's leave it with that but the radio has had their own charm as well um so what's going on
in your life you've been working for Red Hat though yeah so I'm still working for Red Hat I've been
there about 18 months um yeah I love it so I've moved down here I'm living literally two miles
away from this venue so this is perfect for me so it saves me going to Wolverhampton or to Liverpool
so yeah literally you've been able to sleep in my own bed every night it's awesome yeah
have you uh you know you did a lot of um guest episodes on um learning soundclouds not something
that we can see in the future hope so yeah I mean the nice thing is that uh my girlfriend
lives in Bond which is where Fab lives so uh you know when our calendars collide or whatever
I say it's yeah I pop along and do recording and uh it's good fun yeah thanks very much for
taking the time and uh enjoy the rest of the show
you
morning everybody my name is Ken Fallon and uh it's on campus over actually
uh we're outside just having breakfast and I'm here talking to Les how are you doing this
oh fine thanks so um people might not know of you if they haven't been to
Ogkamp I wonder could you tell us why you're so significant
uh this year Ogkamp I was a crew manager looking after different aspects of the events
such as the crew themselves health and safety oh logistical things such as making sure the
rooms have got people in them to man the cameras uh to sign off forms to send off uh memory cards
down to our AV suite so it could be elitist to be put online um and generally just being there
in case anyone's got any questions okay there was uh one comment that I heard throughout the entire
weekend was how efficiently everything was organised I know from under HPR boot um few occasions
we don't have this five seconds later it appears magically we don't have that
next thing we have a power cord uh everything was as smooth as butter so
did you have like a how-to document do you go to www.howtoorganise festival that comes or something
no no at all um a lot of it is common sense for mistakes I've made at events that I've done
in the past um and I'm just using those mistakes and lessons learned and making sure I get it
right this time such as um we're more crew than what we needed but that's fantastic because it
means you can rotate the crew around so the crew aren't doing one job all day you can have the
crew doing the job for an hour swap them off with someone else they get an hour's breaks
gone watch a talk or whatever they want to do your person comes in does the job for an hour
vice versa yeah I don't know if people understand like every room had two people full time
in their working uh so what can you can you just describe the when when it started and
uh basically work away through all the to-do list right to the end yeah um I can take it from the
top and when we first got there in the morning it was a simple job of looking around the venue to
see where the rooms were none of us have been in there to see where the main hall was where tindle
suite was or where barley was so it's just a bit of orientation to see where things are those
were the three rooms that the talks are going to be held in that's right yeah we also had the
exhibition space where you were with your booth um after that's done it's then looking at what
he's doing so signage tables chairs electric networking campfire manager cameras computers for the
AVs suite um what else did we need banners putting up which on two nights we forgot to take down as
well that's a fail whoops now well uh lesson learned for next time yeah were you supposed to
from the organisers taking the the one outside yes the one inside was fine um but the one outside
was on the car parts it could have been pinched but I don't think you would have been down in
uh lovely uh seri butter could you never know yeah you never know um once all the basic logistics
had done like setting up stalls uh raffles and t-shirts and mugs uh it was then going into the
rooms having the cameras set up by the AV team and that was led by Alan Bell yep make sure he's
got what he needs so he'll need crew to man cameras and also to pick up the release forms for the
videos so in the three rooms that we had we had two members of staff working all day so there's
at least one person in the room at all times now that person's job is after the speakers finish their
talk is to walk up with a release form and say would you like this video on the web if they say no
no problem it won't go on the web if they say yes send this form we'll take it that and the SD card
back to the AV suite and they'll copy that onto the hard drive and then encode it at a later date
yep it was a real work for somebody who's been to start this morning yes we were hoping to do it
so in situ unfortunately um map you dobbeney's machine it was only uh encoding video on one core
even though it was a quad core zion i think it was so it wasn't quick enough it was taking four
hours to render 30 minute video from HD so he's now i'm gonna be doing that work at a later date yeah
that is absolutely fantastic um but i'm guessing there's probably been an awful lot of work prior to
the event where you involved in that as well or was that the yeah it was involved with that um it's
really i came on at a little bit late um probably about a month to the end so i actually found
it out all logistics and what happier um so i was playing catch up for a couple of weeks but after
that is just simply sitting down with down yeah well not physically but uh and just looking at
what we want what are our requirements for the event so we broke down the requirements into groups
so a v um stalls health and safety signage that sort of thing and i'm looking at what crew we've
got if that member of the crew has specific skill like the a v team yeah they're instantly put into
the a v uh bundle yeah and everyone else i'll divvy up the work between them so everyone has a
job to do yeah been on the day just simple case of okay that needs to be that needs to be let's go
and it didn't end after the show there were other events where you were organizing extra
extra festival events i guess yeah um the dimensions of the bar at the hotel yesterday morning
that there's going to be a lot of thirsty geeks coming back from the event and could they stay
open a bit longer and uh to the credit they did normally it's a half ten close we got half
eleven last night which was quite good it was a bit of an improvement as to be said listen do you
do you have a document somewhere or a website somewhere that we put this down for other people
to be able to you know if they want to organize it in a short just at least a take list to have
people thinking about it for future events not a search but it's a good idea something that
could be done i mean after this event now i mean a couple of days sound there'd be a debrief
with them the presenters in the crew just to ask what went right what went wrong yeah and then
from that a lessons learned document could be produced that would be absolutely fantastic because
i know a lot of people here in the Hitchcock are not supposed to festivals and they're
were involved in fact today i just posted a show about the high linux fest which is the next
fest coming up and i'm sure there's a lot of lessons to be learned oh sure there is i mean i've
learned lots of lessons kind of past a year from doing events i've done about four or five
what are the other events did you do um there was my own in Manchester in april yeah what was that
that was called you cubed um that was an Ubuntu and Debian events so it's bringing both
communities together just a day of talks it's a very small bar camp there's only two rooms
but it was really well attended about 40 people turned up yeah um we had an install fest going
on the back of the room with old machines but a raffle with prizes donated from different
organisations including one of the members of our law cube generously donated an old computer
of theirs very good um dan linch did the keynote talk there and we had anamoris who's um i say one
of the leading members of three software in Manchester for women yeah who she also has flossy.org
as well l o double s i e dog linking the show not and um that website is all about women in tech
and oh frees off where yeah that's something she started with paul agrain from foss box
um so it's quite interesting that all these people turned up and the lessons that i learned
in a day were don't start the talks too early because people don't turn up straight away
if you say doors open at 10 start the talks about 10 45 not at 10 like i did um
um and really it's the crew aspect on the day there was enough crew at uq's just to do the job
but we didn't have a lot of resiliency if some of us wanted to go out for some food
we had people covering two or three different things whereas our camp if someone's
going out for food we had enough people to just to pull in and do the job while i went out and
got food yeah everybody the cruising quite relaxed as opposed to uh other conference was where
the running from one thing to the next thing and you know this is getting done but yeah people
had time to come around and have a chat and uh did you organise all the AV stuff uh the
intercommunication walkie talkie jobies no that was Tony Whitmore's job that uh it was yeah
it was a walkie talkie man i just turned up and abused him very good by doing lots of very old
1970s CB language over the radio uh look very cool in the desert so what's next now that you
become like mr organized talkie um well the next thing for me is a week today and that's um i'm
all guys in blackpool geek up or geek up blackpool to give it its under name properly which is a
monthly social event for geeks in the area okay just turn up in a pub that we've got have a drink
chat about projects are working on we've got projectors and screens and what have in the pub
you can give a talk or if you don't want to give a talk you can sit in the bar and have a drink and
just chat and that's just a monthly thing that we do just just a bit of socialising really
it's absolutely fantastic uh not maybe not have to get a little bit of a hangover but it seems
like a great idea yeah i'm feeling a bit rough this morning as well yeah listen i'm going to
call the hall to it there um if ever you're involved in any events and you want to uh
promote them here in HBR gives us a shout and we'll organize an interview or you can of course
come record a show it's really easy to do folks just go to aga public radio the other org for such
