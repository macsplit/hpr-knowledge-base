Hello and welcome to Hacker Public Radio. In this episode of Hacker Public Radio,
I'm going to be talking about a website. Now that website is FightCodeGame.com. I was
introduced to this website by a colleague at work, Steve Dingley. We used JavaScript and
JQuery to make our websites shine and sparkle. FightCodeGame.com is a website where you can
use JavaScript to make your own virtual robots and pit them against each other in a reader
of virtual death and goal. So if you're interested, you can sign up to GitHub. You can go to FightCodeGame.com
and use a GitHub account and authenticate using that and create a robot for you to put in the
reader. If you want, you can find me on there on TitaniumBunker and I've got a robot but he's
not yet public. At the moment he stands around and gets killed. He doesn't do anything because
I haven't written all of the logic for him to fight back with but I have plans, basic plans
to sort of not get killed. So if you're interested in battling virtual robots in a virtual arena
using JavaScript and enhancing your JavaScript skills in the process then check out FightCodeGame.com.
