Okay, welcome everybody to Community News. This is co-culture and can
fall on and let's start by welcoming a few new hosts that stay new age
techno hippie and epicanos welcome to Hacker Public Radio and your
little friend there who's your babysitting as well for the show. Yeah that's
loopy she's barking in the background I don't know exactly what she's saying. Okay so
shall we start off doing the show review for last month? Absolutely. Okay well
episode 7 for one was also talking on HPR community news for last month and you
said you mentioned in that show that we should put out the call to see if
people wanted to join for this month but I guess it's bad we can't give in
fourth of July holidays for the majority of our listeners. Yeah and the first
of July holiday for Canadians. What's the festival? Preta if we give my
name. It's Canada Day first of July so it's a long weekend for us as well. Yes okay
but what we'll do is we'll put this as a regular thing into our Google
calendar page which I'm planning on embedding into the HPR website and the
address information will be provided from the to the Mumble server kindly
donated by the guys over Linux basics. Works out quite well. So yeah I have a
question about the Mumble server is there is this just for a certain period of
time that we have it or are we gonna have it for longer? I think the guys have
registered they've registered another domain name and their view is that they
wanted to make it as a service for the greater community and they've put on
rooms and stuff for basically anybody who wants to come in this HPR room there
and you just it's if you've never used Mumble before download the client you put
in the information you know the server information the port number you pick a
username and then you're dumped into a lounge and you can just pick your icon up and drop him
into the HPR room if there's anyone there they will and you say hello physically into microphone
they will hear it on the other side it couldn't be simpler okay so while I was here last month
recording last month show one of the guys called Dave came on board and he was checking it out
so I took the opportunity of recording a show there and he did the now obligatory how I got into
Linux show and that actually was the how I got into Linux thing was actually started by Monster B
he did a series sometimes back and it was one of the more popular ideas and
it seems like a very good one for people to wet their feet yeah it's absolutely so I know
that 742 was like the first show you recorded with Mumble and there was a comment about the sound
quality but I think you figured out how to deal with that yeah it's not you know it's uh it was
I was using a cheap mic and since then I am now using for this episode and subsequent
episodes I'm using my zoom H2 which also doubles as a mic it's a solid state recorder but if you
just plug in a USB in it it works as a regular mic and I'm using a good quality headset so there's
no feedback just a lot of the issues so the following day was episode 5 in Scarlet's series
the language frontier and the day after now you skipped one he skipped one seven for three the
Beagle board yeah k5 went and viewed uh adjacent cried their credener about Beagle board
what do you think of that one it's it's really interesting I mean just because it's fanless
and doesn't need a lot of power there's so much you can do with it I just checked out the website
and there are lots of projects actually using the Beagle board yeah you did some robotics hardware
hacking stuff so this would be right up your alley yeah I did that was like many years ago
still have you on board for some HPR episodes on that but I think I'm going to do the t-shirt
one first okay then I must say I'm a sucker for this hardware hacking stuff I've never really
done any hardware hacking has yet but it's always something that I'm you know find intriguing
and basically want to do it's very intriguing it just takes a lot of time and I'm just still waiting
for this HPR show that kind of does like a 101 introduction to hardware hacking that I could just
get started again I also have an order we know to end up flying around on my desk here and and I
hope I get some kind of introduction to something that I really want to do um and then 744 was
from to your episode 5 and then we had Mr Gadgets who is saving my queue thank you very much Mr Gadgets
give us a rundown on the innovative software about the Wings spreadsheet software program
and I have to say that Wings thing is bespelled which somebody pointed out in the comments it
actually should be Wings with a set at the end and I'm wondering how can we make corrections to this
do I have to go into the database to correct it yeah I love to go into the list but not to where
I can do that I think we should no problem no problem sorry for the miss something we are we are
human and okay can you remind me to do that after the show please yes I'll put a note into the
show notes maybe okay um interview 746 was an interview I did with Tony with more about
out camp 11 and that was also recorded with mumble just a reminder tip for everybody it'll be on
August 13th and 14th in pharnum maltings in the UK and when I was looking this up I realized that
I'd spent a year living within about five kilometers of there so it's a really nice area really
good beer and it's easy to get to from Catholic airport if you're flying it we will be holding
we will have a booth there and I'll probably offer to do a talk about HPR and if I do
and it's accepted it because it's a bar camp so you don't know who's going to vote for
or whatever so if people are interested in that and I get to talk I will record that as a
show and hopefully during that show I will record somebody else's doing a podcast in that show
so that is that is my plan and if you're coming I know that JWP is going to be coming over
and so I'm looking forward to seeing him and if there's anybody else please give me a shout
okay sin 4 7 I was kind of talking to Finox the first for the first time and we talked about
botnets which was very interesting and then we talked about DNS tonal language which was kind of
a little bit over my head no just cool but I hope people got something out of it I uh I actually
Bob a friend of mine tried that one time uh didn't work as it happened for the yeah
it's kind of interesting the following day we had 748 with digital science doing uh my favorite
audio casts and brother mouse says he totally agrees about Babbage yes I listened to Babbage too
it's it's an interesting podcast okay never know one thing I was kind of hoping for with this
podcast was that there would be all the links to this audio cast yeah that would have been a great
thing for them show show note yeah if you're doing and this is a great series as well my favorite audio
cast because everybody who obviously is listening to our public radio listens to podcasts so if
you're doing these my favorite audio cast or what's on my MP3 player once can you send the next
port of your op ml file or your bash potter file or whatever export file you have even if it's
only a text file with the link some will add that to the show notes did you say okay ml files yes it's a
as you as you probably know you've and the listeners probably know I'm a XML junkie it's a format
for exporting rss feeds so if you have a list of news items in your
pod catcher or in your rss reader it's a standard format that you can export from one application
into another so if you use google read or google listen you can export your podcasts into op ml
okay seven four nine i guess
um this one is titled editing the podcast part one preparation that was
robin from robin gatling from the full circle podcast he's got a whole series of these cute up
and they're it's part of our syndicated Thursday um and i was thinking that we should probably
we've gotten a lot of these audio podcasts um you know how to do you show how to edit you show
all the link tips you know a tattoo did one on on audacity and pipeline music did one on our
tour so we should probably put them together somewhere so that people can pick their
uh shows depending on their skill level yes absolutely and what i like about these show notes is
that they actually say the runtime of the show which um i find nice information yes it's it's
actually a very uh very nice um his shows are the whole full circle podcast is very well as it's
like a professional um he's very he's trimmed down the intro of hpr nice and short uh he merges
it into his own it's very clear what he's doing and as an example of how to edit a show this is
of course that takes a large time and i will not be doing that for this but as a as a goal
it's definitely a good um a good starting off point
and actually that runtime thing is something that we can get so we should actually have that
automatically added into the uh show notes yes with our re-working of the whole tms
and so on more about that later tune in to the second half of hpr community news
then we had my pat to linux the new age techno hippie um starting 1995 red at fedora um
and then he he was saying that he didn't like the change from red at fedora so he uh switched
to slackware and then to arch linux and he's now started using mammal and is in 900 so uh
hopefully we'll be hearing a lot more from him uh time goes on there are uh he's also
no i probably want to uh probably he's been in touch about some ideas for other shows so um
very excited about those and so the next one was um binary evolutions
which is lord dragonbloth and donor um with lots and lots and lots of links to um to the topics in
question um this was a um a show that um i bumped up the queue because there was uh it was downer's
first show or so i thought until i listened until i heard it in the stream and apparently he did
uh co-hosted one earlier on but he didn't get credit to for it which is again something
will be rectifying in the new cms um that you'll be able to assign multiple hosts to a to a single show
and um there there were some comments in uh about they're talking over each other in the in the show
yeah i know that's i think something that is often criticized like new people doing podcasts that
they talk over each other but it's really hard not to i have to say yeah i think a lot of
in that show was as a result of um the recording two different web files um and i i've also noticed
it here when we record mumble that um for the same recording you have a minute or two extra at the end
so what i've had to do is go in and delete the silence the delete spaces of silence on the
on the longer track to try and get them back it was very noticeable at the end of the last hpr
min show it seemed like i was talking over um alden the whole time when in fact it was that the
audio tracks i got out of sync oh i see so you actually when you record with mumble is it a lot
of manual work in the end um well last last month it was because um it was your mic was on the
time so i had to put mute in but um recording the episode for cc hits it was actually quite okay
because i had my mic muted whenever i wasn't talking and then i just noticed at the end that
there was this extra space and then when i listened to the questions and answers at the back at
the end of the show i realized that they had gone out of phase and that kind of happens with
web files there's a remember parkman music was talking about this on the open source musicians
podcast that there's a you can get a web file with timing in it so that that doesn't happen but
i guess that's not been implemented with mumble okay but um back to the content of this show i mean
i i found it really interesting it was actually good that it got bumped up because they talked about
a lot of kind of news item that if they would have been in the normal queue they would have been
a little bit out of date yeah exactly and there is rule one there is is for that type of thing
for you know stuff that's news where the it needs to be bumped to the top of the queue
in this case i asked a few people if they're minded and they didn't so and then we had
okay sorry you want to take 752 no you go for it okay um my path to linux knoppicks
mr gadgets yes and for we have reached the knoppicks station but the journey is not over no
not at all in the next one 755 uh barryman again with his jazz 753 purely
interview with clavius 753 yeah 753 oh this was a k5 entering
k5 oddly enough interviewing clatu who is the all-time favorite host here on hbr
and he was talking about slacker media which is a distribution a meta distribution
and done by maintain by clatu and based on slacker and it's actually really interesting to look at
their website and and also see all the tools that they're using and the documentation is really great
yes it is it's uh what i i shudder at the concept of um of building
something on slacker and having to maintain this whole thing but i guess if you're already a slacker
person um i think it's just a documentation on how to get your this i mean how to actually set
up your slackware for uh if you're a media person yeah exactly i i don't think it's a real
distro on its own no all it is in the same way linux much scratches the distro so and that's
nothing but a document okay um and then skirlot episode six was the last uh was the last episode in the
um the language frontier and the universal there's a comment there about the universal language that
english is a universal language in esteranto is a dream so uh if you want to read that you can
read the comment no if uh if one our listeners want to read comments they
that they don't okay you just go to the syndication page and you'll see links to the comments
now you were talking about seven five five i don't know why i skipped so far ahead
yeah seven five five i think i skipped so far ahead because i kind of really like this show because
it's really um it's bare man and and he really knows what he's talking about and you can learn a lot
about yeah and how to record music with linux yes this is his stuff is another one that's going to
be going on to this audio um page whenever we get a set up yes and he he's got a lot of people are
interested in really interesting stuff i could listen all day and uh yes that is actually the feeling
you get and i'm beginning to uh get into his uh i don't know if he's take two more uh middle of
the road type jazz tunes but uh they're they're becoming i can uh i can listen to them now
do you do you like jazz well you know after the last time when we both kind of admitted that we don't
like jazz i felt a little bad because i really liked his show yeah um so yes i and and i like you know
musicians and i can listen to jazz when i can see the person actually doing it or no more about
the person doing it but i'm not a person that goes to jazz concerts and all right um and then the
following day we had Joel doing a basic rf and uh this was actually indirect uh was a request by
myself for um for more on the uh more information from Joel on basic uh you know an introduction to
rf and what's actually going on and i found it i found it's quite interesting really interesting he's
got some very good links there to a meff and single side band which i listened to and followed
along the show um he did record the show uh while walking to the bus so that is um takes away
somewhat from the order of quality and that's uh somebody mentions that in the comments which
is fair enough uh i've been accused of of that very same thing myself in one show uh i think it was
episode uh 78 way back when but uh as Drupes said to me back then um HBR is about the quality
of the content and not necessarily about the quality of the audio so um i hope Joel continues to do
that and i was i've asked him uh if he wouldn't mind what i think would be really cool if we did have
two listeners uh if there was somebody else within radio range of Joel that could um go on us on
a radio um on this cd or whatever and uh record a show um that's recorded over the airwaves so that
we could get a feeling for what one of these shows would be like or you know what the communication
would be like what do you think of that idea i absolutely like the idea um i i didn't quite like the
comment that he got about the audio quality because it wasn't very constructive uh i think maybe
if somebody has a show where the audio quality for some reason is not optimal it may help to just
mention that at the beginning of the show like how why he why the sound quality is like that and
then people may understand a little better well he did explain in the show that um he was doing
it deliberately so that he uh so that you know you would get the feeling of the purpose of or of um
having your own license ham radio was so that you know the audio quality was not going to be
optimal so that if you were into perfect audio quality ham radio was you know this is what you can
expect it's not always brilliant it can also be rough so um i guess in that vein he was he was quite
right and saying it and i will say again here we at hpour will accept any show um so long as it's
audible and that that means you know you might have to strain to listen to hear some words you might
have to um yeah you might have to rewind it or whatever to pick things up again but if
um somebody has gone to the effort to make a show um then we're going to put it on for sure um
with one with the show where they were talking over each other i emailed the guys to say you know
i'm putting it on but you do know that it's uh at your talking over each other and apparently they
did and they had tried to edit it as much as possible and that's what they got out of it so
at that point i thought well that's fair enough you can ask for more than that
i guess so and then everybody's free to actually listen to the show or not so yeah exactly if
if something makes you can't handle just you know delete it move on to the next show
that's that's the thing about hpour there's always something else so uh seven
five eight was uh into no no no seven five seven what are we doing today we're all
all over the space for all my stuff seven five seven
acknowledgement courtism we can't skip that one no we can't feel for it well it's a great show
i don't think we can do it just this by you know talking about it everybody should just
listen to it don't um very you know some people i don't know if he's done podcasting before
but if he hasn't he's you know like a duck to water it has to be said um so go listen to that show
the following day was myself who was far from a podcaster with an interview with John the
nice guy sprigs and this was uh about cc hits.net um and it was more uh you know i'd intended to
interview the guy but it was more like just a chat with John so uh if hopefully hopefully you
went to cc hit.net and you got something from it i actually went there and they are looking for
developers and i was very tempted but then i wouldn't have time to do anything for hpr so
you don't want to go there no you do actually uh i wanted to make an order here today that if
um it was a mammoth interview so i guess maybe a lot of people missed it but um we are
we are here on hpr if people want to put uh crazy comments music into their shows feel free to do
that at number one and number two if you are um willing or want to um submit
shows to cc hits.net on behalf of hpr then feel free to do that i'm thinking perhaps of people
like pokey who have downloaded a lot of songs from songfights um so and bury man yes exactly
okay so the following day we had 759 i guess it's 759 is we yeah lpi study group i i had to look up
on the web what the lpi actually stands for uh because they kind of they jump into the whole thing
yes i wanted to give some background to that but it's a um i think we covered it in the last
i mentioned the last show but the lpi is a linux professional institute and it's a
rather than get certified as red hat or novell or or whoever hp or ibm version of linux it's a
linux it's a generic base of qualification that's vendor neutral um and it's actually quite well
respected so uh these guys are there's 13 modules they've got 13 weeks will do it um because there's
a a test for a hundred uh dollars at the Ohio linux fest personally i think they have their work
cut out for them so i thought in order to give them a little bit of promotion we put that on
syndicated Thursday yeah i think that's a good one and seven sixty the last one
yep is clatoon talking to rob zero rob zero of slacks build dot org and i recommend everybody to
actually look up uh slacks builds dot org uh website to see what is there because it's quite
amazing it there's quite a wealth of um builds for slackware that you can get from there
do you run slackware no okay hello i only just started using linux i'm a unix person
that's that's a lot to you yeah it's not that far away from linux but it's different
yes it is um but it's uh yeah it's actually was my first uh first linux distribution to go on but
that's uh that's something for another time i just want to quickly go through the tanks and apologies
first of all i'd like to thank 5150 um or sending on a picture of a combine harvester just to give
you some background on that he uh you know we're still shipping um hpr stickers i know you guys are
quite low on them so we'll probably um try and order some more i have some for um so i sent out
some uh recently and i'll have some for org camp to give them out there but um people who have
received them have started sending back uh pictures of them in the wild and 5150 stuck one
onto his combine harvester and it was zoomed in quite close and you can see it on the uh on
Google Picasso website thing so um my kids didn't know what it was and then i asked him for a
bigger version of it and he sent me a big you know a picture of the combine harvester in the field
and my kids were incredibly impressed that i knew somebody who had a combine harvester
there you go um there you go yeah lost Bronx and mr. Gadgets thank you very much for letting
me reschedule the shows and Jonathan Nadu from Frostka Frostbite media um did look across the
three sites the WordPress site and the Drupal site and hpr itself to see how they were accessibility
wise and i'd like to apologize to uh ice canoe for um or how you had some trouble recording uh show
via the call-in line if you do record a show via the call-in line you must put a um pound sign
octet or hash sign at the end or your recording doesn't get saved now uh 5150 is looking into
whether we can do something about that going forward but they'll you know recordings regardless
will be sent up but um he has offered to record and hopefully you'll do that so anything else
how did the um business cards go by the way for self yes they did not arrive in time
unfortunately i don't know what the problem was but moory printed them and now there and there
are 400 business cards with poke for the next whatever festival okay cool did we hear back anything
on how it went itself now i didn't hear anything i don't know if the conference back arrived in time
i hope so was a poke you running that or was it uh clutty now it was clutoo and um someone else
sorry my brain is not working yes minus not working so apologies this will be a no apologies for
next month um okay um few things about the if you're uploading a show um we are we the admins are
responsible for adding the old caro.net outro at the end of the show so we'll update that um so if
you could download the new outro to your show and uh use that instead i'd also like to switch to
using html for the show notes uh so there'll be an updated version of the readme file um this month
so if you could have a look at that please and we'll comment more about that at the end of the month
um shall we go through some of the other news that was on the mailing list it's it's been a bit
quiet this month so um the mailing list is attacked public radio at our four slash mail
list will redirect you over there if you're not on it already please join even if you're not a hp
or host yeah let's talk at the hairbrained idea i i didn't respond but i actually would like to
participate especially if we do it with mumble yes can you uh can you tell tell our listeners what
that hairbrained idea is um it's some audio recording i don't really remember the details
that i mean i i always wanted to go back and respond but um i didn't so i don't remember
i think the uh the idea there is that he wants he's thinking of doing a theatrical
production some production using the voice talent of the hp or host and community so you don't
have to be a hp or host to participate you can just be a hp or listener is more than fine if you're
interested in adding your voice to the uh to this theater work of lovies okay and we had uh
corber with a idea to have uh creative commons uh augcast netcast whatever cast and video
torrent tracker and he's been busy looking into that so if there's people interested um go back
on the mail list and have a we look at that gets quite technical on the whole torrent thing what
they're what they're trying to do so um should we deal with selecting the cms now
yeah i see that you got some feedback um yeah from tell us about it from Jonathan um i
i one of the main stated goals of any cms or any hp or site is that it's got to be accessible
um particularly for blind users um i don't i'm still working on some ideas how to make it accessible
for deaf users yes don't laugh it's a podcast um so um he was kind enough yeah if any of you
have listened to any of us this weekend devian this weekend for door this weekend whatever um
you know that he's very busy at the minute but he did take time to go and look over the hp or site
the um jupel site and the WordPress site to see how they were all going to work out
and he his points are that the original that the hp or site is isn't that bad he
preferred the WordPress site mostly because um yet the person did a better job with the layout
um the jupel site he says is generally very accessible um but it could be cleaned up a little
so um uh so that is any give us some more you know advice on how to do um do some um tips on jupel
uh yeah but anyways it seems that with whatever system we choose it's gonna have work
accessibility wise and the last interesting part about that was uh he has a shout out
i don't he like hold here i don't know if you're a web designer which i'm not uh but it would be
cool for someone to do a hpr episode on website accessibility i can speak on accessibility but not
on design and accessibility so if there are website designers out there uh somebody who designs
website for a living slash hobby then um it would be a nice conversation to have with uh with
Jonathan who see okay how can we how can we improve the accessibility of a site and you know ask
good questions so and it would be great for us to learn as much as possible to make a very great
hacker public radio website kind of future so website somebody who does website design
and knows the questions to ask um feel free to volunteer or at least you know if you don't want to
do the show yourself drop us a quick email with some points to ask and we'll we'll be sure and get
that done so we've had a few meetings about um the um the website um i spoke to Ira i spoke to
code cruncher and a few other people on the email and as it turns out regardless of which
solution we pick we're going to have to um hard code uh our own stuff on that hard code we're
going to have to code certain elements of the hpr website anyway so what we've decided to do is
take baby steps and improve the site as it stands now at the moment and where possible
use external services for all the cool features so i don't know if yeah and whatever we hard code
we can always port it over to another cms if if we decide to make that step dance and yeah it's
probably the safest thing to do anyway for the moment um on the higher c channel um we had
pegal has offered to mirror hpr now i know uh we i want to uh have stank send in a stank dog
send in a he has promised me a pod episode on you know the specs of the server and the bandwidth
that we're pulling down i think i'm trying to consolidate that statistical information anyway um
so that would be probably interesting for our listeners but he has offered to host a mirror
and as a backup i think i'll uh i'll start ftp and stuff over to him okay next point
call this to fm what's that about well i got an email out of the blue saying that somebody had
suggested that we go to we put hacker public radio on klisto fm um which is um one of these
um streaming services but um unfortunately they did as i was reading the terms of service they
don't allow recording or redistribution of any of their streams which is incompatible with
the creative commons license that we release the show under so therefore um i think personally
that that would be a violation of our license so too bad maybe we can find some other streaming
services that would well i don't know if yeah i don't know if uh if it would be because i mean
we say in the maybe we should add to the outro that you can download the show for free at
hackerpublicradio.org so it's despite the fact it's been streamed by them they are conforming
to the license because it's licensed under that and so long as people know where they can get it
so more to think about i guess yeah good point okay the last thing i want to talk about is the
cc bias a thing yeah that's going well isn't it it it is uh 17 holes have replied though so we
still have a hundred and seven who have them replied so well you didn't oh did you ask for replies
i know that people just spontaneously said that for to them it's okay but you only asked for feedback
not really for everybody to reply whether they are okay with it no i asked them well i thought i
asked them for a reply okay all right i'll tell you what i'll do and this is something i need to
ask anyway i will ask yes or no uh if people want their show licensed so this is a notification
to everybody who has hosted the show i will be sending an email to you asking explicitly
whether you licensed the show and of course i'll take those holes out if i have not heard
back from you and you you assumed that you had given permission or not please email me because i
need a i need a copy of a document somewhere with your email address i'm not to say that you
approved the license change i just can't go ahead willy nearly change it but even though we only
have seventeen holes who have returned all of them so that's a hundred percent you know of people
which is very positive um that corresponds to let me let me rephrase that a hundred percent of
the people that have replied agree to have the permission changed thank you very much for that
you are a lawyer in your day life um so that corresponds to a third of the shows so far have
been re-licensed so that's kind of cool and i don't know if you thought cold crunchier but i've
modified the cms that you can select the license per host now i haven't seen it but that's good
if you go into the edit host thing you can uh visit drop down there and um starting the
now that we've decided to go ahead with the current site i'll be adding rss feeds and versions of
the feeds so that you have a cc by s a and and greater feed and the non-commercial feeds and i don't
know that's enough that's all i have that's i think all we had on the list so that's the end of
the community views for may 2011 thank you very much for joining us and next month we'll post
it in the on the mailing list and on the website if you want to join the show feel free to do so
and it's goodbye from me and goodbye from cold crunchier
thank you for listening to hacker republic radio for more information on the show and how to
contribute your own shows visit hackerpublicradio.org
you
