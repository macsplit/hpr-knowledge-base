This show is a counterpoint to the show HPR 3,311 colon, Bradley M. Coon's article from 2019
on Richard M. Stallman.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia quoted in September 2019, Richard Stallman resigned as
president of the FSF and left his visiting scientist, Rowlett MIT, after making controversial
comments about Marvin Minsk's alleged role in the Jeffrey Epstein-Sex trafficking scandal.
Stallman remained head on the GNU project nevertheless and, in 2021, he returned to the FSF
board on direct and end quote.
Since the show once submitted both the free software foundation, FSF and Richard Stallman
have released statements on the matter.

Statement on FSF board on election on Richard Stallman.
Published on April 12, 2021-1025 AMI free software foundation.
The voting members of the free software foundation, which include the board of directors,
voted to appoint Richard Stallman to aboard seat after several months of thorough discussion
and thoughtful deliberation.
We decided to bring RMS back because we missed his wisdom.
His historical, legal and technical acumen on free software is unrivaled.
He has a deep sensitivity to the ways that technologies can contribute to both the enhancement
and the diminution of basic human rights.
His global network of connections is invulnerable.
He remains the most articulate philosopher and unquestionably dedicated advocate on freedom
in computing.
RMS acknowledges that he has made mistakes.
He has sincere redress, especially at how under toward him personally has negatively
impacted the reputation and mission of FSF.
While his personal style remains troubling for some, a majority of the board feel his behavior
has moderated, and believe that his thinking strengthens the work of the FSF in pursuit of
its mission.
We take full responsibility for how badly we handled the news of his election to aboard seat.
We could plan the flow of information that was not executed in a timely manner,
or delivered in the proper sequence.
FSF staff should have been informed, and consulted first.
The announcement RMS ugly replanted was a complete surprise to staff,
although, who worked so hard to organize a great event, to lead replanted speakers,
and to the exhibitors.
We could vote for a more inclusive and thoughtful process, and we apologise that this did not occur.
In his position on the board, RMS has the same responsibility as other members.
He is a unpaid volunteer, and subject to the organization's policies,
including prohibitions against conflict of interest, and sexual harassment,
and no outstanding whistleblower processes, and fiduciary duties.
The responsibilities on the board are described at HTTPSco.nz-www.fsf.org.nz-about-sash-the-ro
on the FSFs board of directors. We believe his news will be critical to the FSF as we
advance the mission, and confront the challenges that software freedom faces.
In recent weeks, the board has committed to a series of changes related to organizational governance,
including plans to adopt a transparent, formal process for identifying appropriate
candidates to become new board members, future changes to the organization's bylaws,
and the addition of a staff representative to the board of directors.
Selected by FSF unionized staff, senior systems administrator,
and killing one elected to a newly created staff seat on the board of directors
are voting member on March 28. The FSF board will continue to pursue additional ideas,
and actions designed to improve transparency and accountability.
There is still considerable work to be done. We recognise the need to attract a new generation
of activists for software freedom, and to draw the movement. We will report our discussions,
and activities to the community as we move forward. As we work on these issues,
let's not forget the purpose of our movement, or the great work on our staff,
and all the good people of the free software community who are dedicated to users freedom.

Talman. Ever since my teenage years, I felt as if there were a filmicote and separating me from
other people my age. I understood the words of their conversations, but I could not
grasp why they said what they did. Much later I realised that I didn't understand the subtle
cues that other people were responding to. Later in life, I discovered that some people had negative
reactions to my behaviour, which I did not even know about. Tending to be direct, and honest with
my thoughts, I sometimes made others uncomfortable, or even offended them, especially women. This
was not a choice, I didn't understand the problem enough to know which choices there were.
Sometimes I lost my temper, because I didn't have the social skills to avoid it.
Some people could cope with this, others were hurt. I apologise to each of them.
Please direct your criticism at me, not at the free software foundation.
Occasionally I learned something about relationships and social skills, so over the years I've
found ways to get better at these situations. When people help me understand the aspect of what
went wrong, and that shows me a way of treating people better, I teach myself to recognise where
I should act that way. I keep making this effort, and over time, I improve.
Some have described me as being tone deaf, and at its fair, with my difficulty understanding
social cues, that tends to happen. For instance, I defended Professor Minsky on an MIT
mailing list after someone leaped to the conclusion that he was just guilty as every Epstein.
To my surprise, some thought my message defended Epstein, and I had stated previously,
Epstein is a serial rapist, and rapist should be punished. I wish for his victims,
and those harmed I seem to receive justice. False accusations, real or imaginary, against me,
or against others, especially Angamy, I knew Minsky only distantly, but seeing him unjustly
accused made me bring to his defence. I would have done it for anyone. Police brutality makes me
angry, but when the cops are about evict him afterwards, that false accusation is the ultimate
outrage for me. I condemn racism, and sexism, including their systemic forms, so when people say
I don't, that hurts too. It was right for me to talk about the injustice to Minsky,
but it was tone deaf that I didn't acknowledge context the injustice that Epstein did to women,
or the pain that caused. I learned something from this about how to be kind to people,
who have been hurt. In the future, that will help me be kind to people in other situations,
which is what I hope to do, the role of the FSF Board of Directors.
Published on March 22, 2021-1055 PMI Free Software Foundation,
the FSF Board believes it is its responsibility to free software community members, donors,
movement organisations, and the general public, to be a model of good governance.
Good governance starts with the Board of Directors, which oversees the organisation
and is ultimately responsible for its success. The Board's role and legal obligation is to
oversee the management of the organisation, and ensure that the organisation fulfills its mission.
The Board enables good management overseeing the president and executive director,
who in turn manages staff. The Board's oversight role includes decision-making, monitoring,
and leadership. In its decision-making capacity, the Board determines the mission and purposes
of the FSF. Drives the FSF long-term strategy and goals. Form your eights and regularly review
significant corporate policies. Select and evaluate the president,
executive director, and other officers, including determining compensation based on relevant
data for the paid positions, and create and maintain effective succession plans for the FSF leadership
positions. In its monitoring capacity, the Board evaluates how well the FSF is fulfilling its
mission, values, goals, and vision, including evaluating relevant risks. Monitor the FSF
financial performance and use of assets, including approving the annual budget. Conducts regular
review of the FSF internal controls, and financial reporting. Overseas compliance with legal obligations,
and organizational policies, such as those against conflicts of interest, and discusses its own
performance as the leading governing body. In its leadership capacity, the Board maintains the
legal and ethical integrity of the organization. Enhance and protect the FSF public image.

I-laws. Preliminary Board Statement on FSF Governance. Published on March 25, 2021-00AM by free
software foundation. On Wednesday, the FSF Board of Directors committed to a series of changes
related to organizational governance, and the appointment of members to its Board of Directors.
We will adopt a transparent, formal process for identifying candidates, and appointing new Board
members, who are wise, capable, and committed to the FSF mission. We will establish ways for
our supporters to contribute to the discussion. We will require all existing Board members to go
through this process as soon as possible, in stages, to decide which of them remain on the Board.
We will add a staff representative to the Board of Directors. The FSF staff will elect that person.
The directors will consult with legal counsel about changes to the organizations by
launch to implement these changes. We have set ourselves a deadline on 30 days for making these
changes. The Board will meet again Thursday March 25 to consider further decisions, update on
work to improve governance at the FSF. Published on March 25, 2021-1152-00AM by free software foundation
summary on actions from the Board, and voting member meetings on Thursday March 25, 2021.
The voting member unanimously agreed to elect a union staff member, selected by the FSF union staff,
to be a full voting member and director. The first such representative will be elected as soon as
the staff chooses one. The FSF will adopt by launch changes to implement this as a requirement
going forward. The Board of Directors is soliciting proposals from qualified consultant to assist
in creating a transparent, formal process for identifying candidates, and appointing Board members,
who are wise, capable, and committed to the FSF mission. The FSF intends to rewrite the by-law
in a way that binds the organization to transparency in its choice of directors. This process will
establish ways for FSF associate members and supporters to meaningfully contribute to the discussion.
The Board is looking for proposals to be received by Friday, April 2, 2021. Please email info at
FSF.org with the subject, director transparency engagement, for details. FSF president Jeffrey North
announced, I commit myself to remind an FSF officer, director, and voting member Asu has
now in a clear path for new leadership assuring continuity on the FSF mission, and compliance
with new sherry requirements. The Board of Directors will continue this work at its next meeting,
scheduled for Sunday March 28. Read yesterday's preliminary board statement,
welcoming Ian Kelly to staff seat on FSF Board of Directors.
My free software foundation published on March 28, 2021-21 pm. I Jeff Reynolds, FSF president.
As the next step to implement the plan outlined in the Board's announcement last Wednesday,
and Friday to improve governance at the FSF, at today's meeting we officially elected the staff
selection for an newly created seats on the Board of Directors, and voting members.
Union staff selected senior systems administrator Ian Kelly to be the first in this role.
At the end of today's board meeting, we officially welcomed Ian to both bodies.
The Board, and voting members look forward to having the participation of the staff
by a designated seat in our future deliberations. This is an important step in the FSF effort to
recognize and support new leadership, to connect at leadership to the community, to improve transparency
and accountability, and to build trust. There is still considerable work to be done, and at work
we'll continue. I have always known that the FSF has good and hardworking staff, but with the success
of the Replanet 2021, and in talking with staff during the controversy that unfolded immediately
afterward, I have known how it is essential to involve staff much more in decision making,
and strategy discussions. The advice they have offered in the last week alone has been
invaluable. I sincerely believe this step in improving FSF governance will lead to better outcomes
going forward. In all my interactions with Ian so far, he has demonstrated abundant wisdom
and intelligence. Kat Walsh announced her resignation from the Board of Directors last week,
and it became effective at the end of our board meeting on Sunday, March 28, 2021.
Kat has been a great help in discussing difficult issues over the years.
We appreciate the expert knowledge, and service she gave us, and offer Kat our best wishes,
and sincere thanks. The FSF board will meet again on Monday, March 29, 2021.
