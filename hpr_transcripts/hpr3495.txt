This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3495 for Friday, 24th of December 2021.
Today's show is entitled, Podcast Recommendation, The Retroist and Dispart of the Series, Podcast
Recommendation.
It is hosted by Archer 72, and is about 2 minutes long, and carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Podcast Recommendation, The Retroist number 243, Die Hard.
Hello Hacker Public Radio, this is Archer 72.
In this episode, I bring a podcast from the Retroist, number 243.
It takes a nostalgic look at the action film Die Hard released in 1988, and he also discusses
whether or not Die Hard is a Christmas movie.
It was recently brought to my attention that this work at The Retroist was not creative
comments, even though I found it on archive.org, but actually it has a copyright through 2021.
Still is an interesting website to go to, and takes a look back a lot of things from the 80s, 90s,
and even sometimes the early 2000s.
And I thought it would be interesting to get some comments on the movie Die Hard, even though it's
from 1988. He takes a unique look on the characters and roles they played in other movies,
and other such things as that.
So I'll just have to leave a link at the end of my podcast to this other one,
and I hope you enjoy, and I hope it gets comments.
Thank you for listening.
