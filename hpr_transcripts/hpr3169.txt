I'm going to focus on music that's energetic because that's the type of music I tend to prefer.
Our first piece is called piano sonata number 14 and she's sharp minor.
Moonlight Sonata opera 27 number 2 by Ludwig Van Beethoven.
This was completed in the year 1801,
and dedicated to 17-year-old Countess Guisciardi,
whom Beethoven was or had been in love.
The nickname Moonlight derives from an 1832 description of the first movement by poet Ludwig Rellstub,
who compared it to Moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne.
And so here for your listening pleasure is Moonlight Sonata opera 27 number 2,
movement 3, Prestel performed by Paul Pittman on piano.

That song really energizes me.
Let's keep the energy levels up as we move on to another favorite of mine by Ludwig Van Beethoven.
Symphony number 5, which was finished and first performed in the year 1808.
It achieved fame going on to become one of the most popular compositions in classical music.
Beethoven was in his mid-30s at the time, with increasing deafness troubling his life.
In the world at this time, the period was marked by the Napoleonic Wars.
The symphony acquired status as a central item in the repertoire as it was groundbreaking
in terms of both technical and emotional impact,
had a large influence on composers and music critics,
and inspired works by such composers as Brahms, Chikovsky, and Brookner.
The first movement was featured on the Voyager Golden Record.
And so, from the European archive, I present to you Symphony number 5, Part 1.

If you are a fan of Frederick Chopin,
then this next piece will be a treat to your ears.
The next song I'm going to play is Chopin's fantasy impromptu,
written in 1934 and dedicated to Julian Fontana.
The fantasy impromptu draws many elements from Beethoven's
Moonlight Sonata, which you heard at the beginning of this episode.
This piece may be a rare instance in which a musical genius discloses
what he actually hears in the music of another musical genius.
And so, with no further ado, I give you fantasy impromptu.

In the next episode, we'll make it one of the best moments of the theatre
in the Golden Wave Years, one of the best moments of the theatre in the Golden Wave Arts Museum.
Let us return to Beethoven, with piano sonata, number eight, and sea minor.
Sonata number 8 and C minor.
Op 13, commonly known as Pathatic.
This was published in 1799 and was dedicated to Beethoven's friend, Prince Karl von Litschnowski.
It is perhaps the earliest of Beethoven's compositions to achieve widespread and enduring
popularity.
In its entirety, this work takes approximately 19 minutes to perform.
For your listening pleasure today, I give you the third movement which is my favorite
as performed by the talented Paul Pitman.
Finally, let's end this episode of HPR with the first movement of piano sonata number
21, Op 53, nicknamed Waldstein.
This is considered to be one of Beethoven's greatest piano sonatas, completed in 1804.
This sonata has scoped that surpasses Beethoven's previous sonatas and is one of his most
technically challenging compositions.
It's a key work early in his heroic decade between 1803 and 1812.
And set the stage for piano compositions in the grand manner, both in Beethoven's
later work and all future composers.
Once again, this piece was performed by the very talented Paul Pitman.
Enjoy.
I hope this episode brought energy and happiness to your day, and I sincerely hope you enjoyed
listening to it every bit as much as I enjoyed making it.
Well, until next time, this is Paul Quirk, signing off.
Please remember to drive safe and have fun.
