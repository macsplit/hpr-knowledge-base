This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3876 from Monday the 12th of June 2023.
Today's show is entitled Recording an Episode for Hacker Public Radio.
It is hosted by RUNO KEY and is about 8 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, sharing my experience as a first-time contributor.
Hello again, my name is Andr√© Inich, also known as RUNO KEY.
Last week I recorded my first episode on Hacker Public Radio, the podcast you are listening to right now.
This one is recorded on the 15th of May 2023.
Again, I am publishing it under a Creative Commons attribution share-like 4.0 International
license.
I was surprised to get mentioned on the 30 Euros after submitting my show.
You can find me there at RUNO KEY at layer 8.space, no dash and the 8 as a digit.
Link will be posted in the show notes.
In case you want to reach out to me, I'm also delighted to have received an email, even
before my last episode was airing.
I was asked whether I am interested in recording an episode on my experience with contributing
to Hacker Public Radio for the first time.
So this is going to be the topic for today.
And a warning upfront, I have a reputation of overthinking stuff.
I blame my neurodiversity for it.
That being said, I'm positive that sharing my thought process can help make the service
better for everyone.
I'm recording this episode again using Autocity.
Now there's a choice about which software you can use for a podcast.
Online based as well as offline ones.
Autocity wasn't the news for sending an analytic to them.
However, I couldn't find any indication in the settings for it to opt out of them.
The fourth of the software ran packaged up for a debut in Asfix I could tell.
Or perhaps they require an additional sources, sources does list entry, I don't know.
Before recording my very first podcast here, I had only experience with some video recording.
Oftentimes done by the host, but I also prepared a few videos for an online course, which I
couldn't publish because life happened.
And thoughts I give during the pandemic years.
As I often do when I enter a new subject, I went to the library and grabbed some books
to learn more.
In particular, I landed a podcast by Dirk Hildebrand, a small book in German published at
Haufer.
I add a link to that in the journals.
Weed through it, I learned that I'm doing the game.
It's really easy to start a podcast as HPR promises.
The thing I should spend some attention on is keeping a consistent distance to the
microphone and able some level of feedback during the recording so that I can listen to
what is recorded while speaking, using my gaming headset, a lurchy tag G20 230 and prepare
a script.
I don't have to think about designing images for the show or episodes because HPR will
take care of that for me.
It might be different if I start my own podcast, perhaps using funk rail or cast report.
Right now I'm not taking steps towards that, mainly because I need to rent some web space
first.
And in my experience, streaming takes a considerable amount of bandwidth.
Per that, with Hostess that try hard to convince you to buy your domain to them as well and
the choice frames.
I have my DNS provider already, thank you very much.
I looked into how to do feedback in order city and I think the best I should do for now
is sitting on the microphone I can next to the meters in the upper right of the interface
and enable observation before I start recording.
Also leaving a little bit time before and after the recording allows me to cut keyboard
clips for starting and stopping the recording.
In HPR episode 3802, I also learned about skipping silences which is the fact in the
special category on order city.
I hope I don't have pauses so long that I'd learn to trunchate them.
My main thought about going with order city was post-processing directly after the recording.
I learned from my thoughts that I already feel comfortable with the script in front of
me, which is why you hear me speaking like that.
It gives me the security I need to avoid too many arms.
However, I feel like a few things are missing.
Considering that this is a podcast that is distributed through HPR and its partners, I would
like to have chapter markers.
I couldn't find a hint on how to add them in the form I was presented on HPR.
You using timestamps allows me to easily scan the outline of a recording which aids in
the decision making process on whether it's worth the time to listen to a particular episode.
I hope you consider this episode to be useful to make the time for it.
Thank you.
Another question mark I had when preparing the recordings were the settings.
I'm used to have a guideline when recording videos from an online talk, seems like preferred
format or container, to technical details like stereo or mono, to the sampling rate,
where you, as well as whether static or variable, the only thing I found is a hint that
submissions will be transcoded to mono.
I recorded stereo with a default 44 trauma 1 kHz sampling rate here.
There was no recommendations on the format, so I went with the odd forbors instead of
MP3 because of license freedom.
Other city appears to not support flag, so I have to use a lossy format.
It's true that MP3 enjoys right support, but I want to encourage freedom when given
the choice.
I could have chosen WAF files, but those tend to become huge really fast.
Now I also add metadata to the recording.
Warbors offers comments for that.
You can compare to ID3 tags for MP3 files.
Given that I couldn't find a way to enter these chapters information in HPR webforms,
I'm experimenting with EV tag from the Debian repository.
I'm reading the source code of my podchatcher of choice that is antenna port for Android
as distributed in the fred app store.
I can tell that it passes these comments at least.
Instead doesn't yield results.
I hope to see that there is a Warbors comment of the Warbors tool package for the command
line, and there is Q3 with a Qt or a CLI interface.
Packed some slight different metadata by me over the course of my contributions to
HPR.
Last thing I want to highlight before ending this episode is show notes.
Now I have more experience with blogging than recording a podcast.
When researching recommendations online, there's also SEALF Fluff that is search engine optimization.
That goes into writing subtitles.
Usually with catchy titles, clickbait and all the rest.
I have opinions here.
However, I enjoy that there is no leaf or rating in the review part in the episodes I
listen to so far.
Because a podcast is a special author's feed, babyg.
Why would I want to bind myself to a special platform?
But then I also want to be able to read up and search through the content of a podcast
episode.
Right now, I'm sharing my prepared script as a show note.
It should come off as a wall of text.
I'm open to feedback on this front.

Please do reach out to me.
And that's it for today.
I thank you for listening to me, looking forward to hear from you, be it in writing or
as an episode on HPR.
