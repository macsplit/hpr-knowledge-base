Hello, this is Archers 72.
Welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
In the last episode, I covered the article on the LP format.
Now I'm going to go to a more broad subject of formats.
Not just audio formats, but all the formats under the heading content format in Wikipedia.
A content format is an encoded format for converting a specific type of data to displayable information.
Content formats are used in recording and transmission to prepare data for observation or interpretation.
This includes both analog and digitized content.
Content formats may be recorded and read by either natural or manufactured tools and mechanisms.
In addition to converting data to information, a content format may include the encryption
and or scrambling of that information.
Multiple content formats may be contained within a single section of a storage medium.
Example track, disk sector, computer file, document, page column, or transmitted via a single channel,
example wire or carrier wave of a transmission medium.
With multimedia, multiple tracks containing multiple content formats are presented simultaneously.
Content formats may either be recorded in secondary signal processing methods,
such as a software container format, example digital audio digital video,
or recorded in the primary format examples.

Observable data is often known as raw data or raw content.
A primary raw content format may be directly observable.
For example, image, sound, motion, smell, sensation, or physical data which only requires
hardware to display it, such as a phonographic needle, and diaphragm or a projector lamp
and magnifying glass.
