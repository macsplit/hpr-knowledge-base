Hello and welcome to the first C.C.Hitz.net yearly roundup show.
I'd explain a bit more about how this show is going to work in a tick but first let's
get started with the music and open up with the first submitted track to C.C.Hitz.net.
And I think it's a corka.
The track is called Is Up To You and it was released by a band called No Creeps.
This track is licensed to creative commons by attribution, no derivatives.
Oh no, what I did, they asked you what they did to me like they are.
I can't believe, I just don't think you said.
You came into my life, went into my time, the time the time we felt bad.
And suddenly, suddenly broke my fire.
And I'm stuck to you boy, we're waiting to.
I don't care about the world to see what you do, except to you boy, we're waiting to.
I won't care about the world to see what you do, to go my steps.
Just time to speak to where you are, but suddenly, you get the way so far.
You'll never own in your own, no one can wait to where you are.
If that needs rain, I feel so happy.
It's up to you boy, we're waiting to.
I don't care about the world to see what you do, except to you boy, we're waiting to.
I don't care about the world to see what you do now.
I don't care about the world to see what you do, except to you boy, we're waiting to.
So, here's how this show is going to work.
In this show, I'll be playing some of my favourite tracks that you voted for over the past year.
These votes were compiled, unadjusted, and counted, and the top 100 tracks were listed out for me to pick from.
Now, because of how the charts shows are calculated, you might not have heard these tracks in the charts for a while.
Following up from the last track is an artist, often featured by a good friend of mine, Dan Lynch in his podcast right hall radio.
The artist is called David Rovix, and the track that I'm going to play for you is called Resistance.
It's a creative commons licence track, and it's using the bi-attribution, non-commercial, share-alike licence.
Enjoy!
You can call it manifest destiny. You can talk of all your civilisation will give.
You can say that we're a thing of history, and progress is a future you will bring.
You can send your armies to these mountains. You can say we'll prosper beneath your king.
But there will always be resistance. The next battle will always be near.
As long as you have everything, there will be those who have nothing to fear.
And little violent, or maybe all at once you will lose.
Because our future is not yours to choose.
You can say you've got to stop the communists. You can say that our ideals can't succeed.
You can say that competition is the only way. And a global system based on greed.
You can call yourself a Democrat. You can call yourself whatever you will.
You can keep on stamping out the fires you start, so you might stay on top of the hill.
But there will always be resistance. The next battle will always be near.
As long as you have everything, there will be those who have nothing to fear.
And little violent, or maybe all at once you will lose.
Because our future is not yours to choose.
You can say that all of us are terrorists.
Mad men bent on destroying all that's free. You can say that we are building weapons.
As your bombers fly from seat up bloody sea. You can say you're with us or against us.
And to die quietly is what we now must do. You can maintain your innocence.
You can say that you are many as you represent the few.
But there will always be resistance. The next battle will always be near.
As long as you have everything, there will be those who have nothing to fear.
And little violent, or maybe all at once you will lose.
Because our future is not yours to choose.
Another podcaster, Doug Whitfield, from the Ametic Manumid podcaster,
brought to my attention an artist called Professor Click.
And the next track is the hard version of all control.
You can get it under creative commons, biotribution, non-commercial, share-alike license.
You can get it under creative commons or against us.
You can get it under creative commons or against us.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
We have lost, we have lost, we have lost all control.
I have lost, I have lost, I have lost all control.
Here we have lost, I have lost, I have lost, I have lost long control.
Even though this show isn't one of the, run of the male daily, weekly or monthly shows,
you can still vote for any of these tracks by going to cchits.net, slash extra, slash
one, and clicking on any of the links there if you like any of the tracks that have been
played in this show.
Okay, so on with the music, a good friend of the show, and the creator of the music message
show, Gaelic would Amsterdam Mack, gave me a point to the next artist, Rob Warren.
Amsterdam Mack and Rob both frequent the Betty II cafe in Amsterdam, and this was one
of Rob's early releases.
He went on to form a band called Ume Trey, but this track predates that.
The track is called Rise, and it's a creator comments by attribution, non-commercial
Cheradelica License track.
Hope you enjoy.
Damn, what you're gonna get So, the flag got half-myths
And a gentle pain I will Did you farewell, yeah
Sail again
Maybe too long
We've seen some see them
I agree we need Seek new grief, so
I'm prepared to turn my back in
That life can't put safe
I'm now lancos, it's not about the fall
It's about the right, so it's not about the scars you left me
Under these eyes, so I found my peace
So I hold it close and I leave this place you put me
Without your ghost, I'll leave this place you put me
Without your ghost
Clear eyes I see, my new shoes good
I've been trying to recreate
All that I could, so
I hold you dear and I won't forget
But this ship is stopping now
Without regret, oh
It's not about the fall
It's about the right, so
It's not about the scars you left me
Under these eyes, so I found my peace
When I realized that it's not about the fall
It's about the right
Let me rise
Let me rise
Let me rise
Let me rise
Let me rise
Let me rise
Let me rise
It's not about the fall, it's about the rise
It's not about the scars that left me
Under these eyes, oh, I found my peace
When I realize that it's not about the fall
It's about the rise, oh, it's not about the fall
It's about the rise
Changing pace a bit, up next is a creative commons,
biotribution, share-like track by the phase
The track is called Dirty Angel
It's about the rise, oh, it's not about the fall

I worked 20 years without nothing to show So I left behind every thing that I've known
In the hope that my family won't need To go hungry again
They stopped me last time I tried this migration I'm the overflowing man
In this melting pot nation The only thing here in this desert
Is the door that they winded
And I'm not really sure Where the oxygen's going
But it followed me all the way here
The line on the map Didn't stop it from blowing
It's free and that one thing is clear
I don't want to go But my duty is stronger than fear
And the sun doesn't care if it's here
Or if it's all over there It just passes through
The stratosphere Until it goes away
I once watched a sparrow fly south For the winter
Feathers were thin and her body was thinner
But we had enough there to feature Until she was well
The seasons are cycles That go back and forth
One day it's south and the next It is no more
The just need a little relief Till the snow starts to melt
Today she's returning to look For her nest and she's
Followed me all the way here But now in the hole
But the need on her breast And the promise one more year
The radio man is still playing His songs
But the signal is not quite as clear Here I'd rather be back
The place I belong But my family is needing me here
I don't want to go But my duty is stronger than fear
I don't want to go But my dream is stronger than fear
This next track was submitted by a firm supporter
One of the primary source of music for CC hits
And a personal inspiration for me To start the CC hits project
The track was submitted by Dave and Caroline Lee
From the Bugcast podcast Back in April
It's a CC, biotribution, non-commercial,
share-alike license track And it's called Retrovisor
And it's by a band called Olga Forbys

Slash extra, slash one
Back to the music and this year has been one of revolution of civil unrest and of fighting against oppression
The following track is the leaky mix of the track Cyberpunks
and was released by Partition 36 to show support for WikiLeaks in May of this year
It was released under a Creative Commons by Attribution non-commercial share-alike license
The very word secrecy is repugnant and a free and open society
And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, the secret oaths, and the secret proceedings
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts
Far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it
It is a system which has been scripted vast human and material resources
Into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operation
Its preparations are concealed and not published
The stakes are buried and I can learn
It's to set as a silence and not praise

Without debate, without criticism, no administration and no
country can succeed and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian law
make us so decreated a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. That is
why our press was protected by the first, the only business in America
specifically protected by the Constitution, not primarily to abuse and entertain,
not to emphasize the previos and the sentimental. Not to simply give the
public what it wants, to inform, to arouse, neglect, state our dangers and our
opportunities, to indicate our crises, our choices, lead, mold, educate and sometimes
even anger in the public opinion. After that
Electronica, let's go back up beat. Well, will we? This next track is by another
creative common staple, this time one I'm proud to have seen live. The artist is
Jonathan Colton and this is his creative commons, biotribution, non-commercial
track called Blue Sunny Day.
Until it's gone, outside I can't hear it, birds are singing beats, a buzzing sun shines overhead.
I'd be there to see it, but I can't get out of bed. Since the day you left,
however, always feels this way, one more Bruce, Sunny Day.
Looking for an easy mark, I hit the denies after dark and take a lonely
interest, home the drink. She's sincere, but halfway through,
I find I'm wishing she was you, my blood goes cold. I guess this day is over.
Several hours later, I'm the only one awake. All these streets are empty,
empty is just me and my mistake. One by one, the stars go out as black
sky turns to grey, one more Bruce, Sunny Day.
Sometimes I see how long I can wait, tempting disaster by my garden gate.
My trembling hands on the silver door, trying not to think of what it is I'm waiting for.
All at once I've had enough, as if I made a stirner stuff I'd take a breath and open up the door.
Dawn breaks heart and falls on me, for just one moment I can see the pale blue sky.
Close my eyes because the world's so red and beautiful I have to look away.
Braced against the beauty of another perfect day.
As I go to pieces and the breeze blows me away, one more Bruce, Sunny Day.
In 2009, Lawrence Lessig went on the Stephen Colbert show to talk about his book.
In it, Lawrence said that he was happy for viewers to remix the content of that interview.
And here is one of the outcomes of that request.
The track is called Remixing is OK.
And it's been Remixed by Spin Meister and his license to Creative Commons by Attribution. Enjoy.
Anyone out there take this interview right here with some great dance beat.
Remixing is OK.
Copyright laws, copyright laws, copyright laws are turning kids into criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.
Throw the law, kids into criminal, totally bailed war, kids into criminal, totally bailed war.
You say we need a sunny bail, kids into criminal, you say we need a sunny bail, kids into criminal.
Ten years, ten years, we've been waging this war, kids into criminal, you want some hard time, totally bailed, kids into criminal, you want some hard time.
The insanity of a system produced by our Congress, they have passed 24 laws, turning kids into criminal,
turning kids into criminal, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Illusion, illusion, illusion, illusion of action, mixing, OK, OK, OK, remixing, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
Think about, think about, think about what makes sense, what makes sense, taking work and building,
on top of and building, on top of...
I could take your bulk, your bulk right here, right here.
I could take your bulk, your bulk, your bulk, your bulk, your bulk right here.
Think about, if you're something, you're making something new, when you're standing right back, right,
yeah, right, right, right, much more.
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, take anything from that mind, remixing is OK.

it's .net slash extra slash one.
Our next track is called Soundtrack of our Summer, and it's by a band called The League.
Like the last track, this is also licensed Creative Commons by Attribution.
And that's why I would give you the fame.
The set of soundtrack of our Summer, the set of reason of my river,
with one of my eating eggs.
If this is real what I feel, I'm yawning up and yearning to see him.
The sea in the lad won't buy you in the food, but I wish you would feel like you lost it for good.
So pick up your brain, stand, burn it together.
You're ready to shine, this is down in your teaser.

Another very early track in the CC hit system is Dancing Nowhere, by a band called Moot.
This track was the sixth track submitted and was first played in October 2010.
It's since been on eight of the monthly shows and I think you'll see why.

Dancing Nowhere, we're round to the bridge.
Shaves as we stand on the brink.
I laugh now, we're on the verge of tears.
Can you feel my heart beat?
It will let go through the years.
Moomin's legs and the mill's deshrines.
Death power, tennis, jibbers, sprites.
Jolins neck and a spiles ass switch.
Drink that all green fairy and get some poetry out of it.
Lots of reason to live, lots of reason to live.
Cause I've got it all, yes I've got it all to me.
Dancing Nowhere, you've got to believe.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
Dancing Nowhere, you've got to believe.
Lots of reason to live, lots of reason to live.
Cause I've got it all, yes I've got it all to me.
The following track has a much more rocky beat and it's called Down in the City.
It's by a band called Houdini Roadshow.
It's CC, biatriation, non-commercial, no derivatives licensed and I love it.
Nowhere, you've got to believe.
Lots of reason to live, lots of reason to live.
Cause I've got it all, yes I've got it all to me.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
Soul of body and soul of soul to the hands of devil.
And it's on the show.
Down in the city where it all began.
Wakes up in sweat and remind us when she said I'm in the upper lower end.
But I guess I want to dance.
She said I'm in the foot of the road.
But I guess I want to dance.
Yeah, I want to dance.
I am in the upper lower end.
But I guess I want to dance.
She said I'm in the upper lower end.
But I guess I want to dance.
Yeah, I want to dance with you.
With you.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
And breath by God from wealth magic.
You can't even know what love is.
But I guess I want to dance.
You can't even know what love is.
But I guess I want to dance.
Yeah, I want to dance.
I am in the upper lower end.
But I guess I want to dance.
Yeah, I want to dance with you.
But I guess I want to dance.
Yeah, I want to dance.
The penultimate track is called I Am Not Dreaming.
And it's our only duplicated artist in this show.
Josh Woodwood.
It's a hauntingly beautiful track.
And there's a reason I've picked him twice on this list.
He absolutely deserves it.

Yeah, I was a soldier boy in the twilight of my youth.
When I still could feel loved and a trust in above for a truth.
I fought with bravery.
Then I left my gun behind.
But the misery I've seen never wiped itself clean from my mind.
Now I'll never, ever close my complete lady.
When I'm sleeping.
I feel you recognize the people I know.
This is the same as to who made my fear.
God is in dead.
Then I'll kill him myself.
Because I've seen no words on my skin that just burst into hell.
And I'll never, ever close my eyes to dreaming.
And when I'm sleeping.
I'm not dreaming.
I'm not dreaming.
I'm not dreaming.
Now I'll never, ever close my eyes to dreaming.
Now I'll never, ever close my eyes to dreaming.
When I'm sleeping.
I'm not dreaming.
Now I'll never, ever close my eyes to dreaming.
When I'm sleeping.
I'm not dreaming.

So, this is it for me, and I'll go out with this last track. It would be fair to say that it's not what I would consider to be work or family safe, but I could absolutely imagine this track being played in a nightclub and being loved.
And the great thing about creative comments is there's nothing to stop you from taking this piece of music and playing it wherever you want to.

I know I got this something, something that makes you want to go bump and bump and all night long. There's nothing wrong, baby, me and my nose like clubbing, clubbing.
So, ain't no need to be front and front and bring it on.
Better show that, better know that. Cup games are looking full-tired. Now you know that. Are you ready? So fight for three, two, one.
If you want it, come get it, watch me. Take my clothes off, I know how to make you feel all right.
You can look but don't touch when I treat you up. I'm your extra virgin self.
