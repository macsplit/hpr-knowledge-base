Music
Hello and welcome to the O'Claire Linux user group.
Today is Thursday March 12th when we are coming to you live from Julie's pub downtown
O'Claire, Wisconsin.
Hi everybody, go ahead and say hello.
Hi.
Hi.
That was...
Sorry.
I guess that was okay.
Should have made it go.
Class?
No, I think that's once it's enough.
I'm going to pass it on to our fearless leader who will get this meeting started.
Alright, I know.
Oh, thank you.
We do have a music, I see.
Okay.
Not for the official stuff.
And with the official stuff.
So, what do we do right now?
We do two minutes of fame, so we go around the room and we share everything we want to share.
We don't share anything at all.
Don't want to share.
We want to start.
I'll go.
Cool.
Again.
I didn't really do too much.
I will have to say that AT&T met my expectations.
They did not put everything up properly just as I expected.
I have phone.
I do not have internet.
So, are you ordering it?
Oh, yeah.
It should have been hooked up yesterday.
Maybe I should move in.
Move in?
No.
Not at all.
Not at all.
Not at all.
Not at all.
No.
Why don't have internet as the old place?
Of course, they just connected on time.
They don't hook it up right now.
Well, as long as you pay on time, it's okay.
Well, and it wouldn't be so bad except for this is the third time or the three times that they didn't get it right.
So, you know, that's zero percent.
That's not a very good percentage.
Didn't it, Jersey?
You know what?
That was a two month wait to get your phone misled.
Oh.
That's it.
Yeah.
That's it.
Well, you know, he has a house board.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was low wattage.
No, it was gone.
Oh, it was away, that was bad.
It was a primer.
It was back and around the boat.
It was actually like a vinyl material.
It's perfect for making projector screens, uh...
light terror.
Yep.
And they got it in a 5-foot.
Dude, wide rolls, putской esquets, got 5.
Why a 7-foot screen toall of his costs?
What about nine bucks?
What are you thinking.
Blah!
No, actually, I uh...
I've got a couple of one-by-three time.
They're both orange for it and Atlanta.
frame up. And then it's stretched across the frame. So it's actually fairly decent.
And then the other thing they said that you can get some black mat tape and put it
around the edge for nice border. There you go. There's stuff. A lot of $400 they want
for a comparable size screen. But another duct tape could be black duct tape.
Get Gaffer's tape. Maybe. Is that ever shiny back? No, it's dull. But the thing is it doesn't
it doesn't unstick. Oh, see Gaffer's tape. Really? Yeah, well, no, it's not that. You can lift it.
But the point is it won't Gaffer's tape is made the last the long time and won't start
to peel after two or three years. Yeah, that might be something I'll look into.
What is that point? It's stage tape. It's what they use to take down dance floors and
clean some of them. Yeah, okay. Because yeah, the black border, unlike what you see here,
is actually supposed to absorb the light. Yeah, this is a very flat black. You can get it in
gray or black. Where do you get that? Let's see, a stage step, you know, somewhere else
like that. Stage pass, stage step, those kinds of stage supply places on light. But for the
optimal setup, you know, black is supposed to perfectly match where the screen is. The
screen is actually supposed to be about a four inch bigger than your area. Exactly. So then
it's just, there's your screen. Cool. So, huh. Very nice. That's probably the way there's
no laptop. This is kind of down here, but you know, painted black like edges and stuff.
You know, we could probably just go up there and like lift up the screen on one by
you know, I think you probably want to just, you know, the image, not the screen.
How do you know all the screen is in there? Exactly. It's like a chicken and egg thing. It's like
the screen tips in or is the image too? It doesn't really matter as long as the picture comes
on the square. If a tree fell was in the middle of the woods, then you hear it. Did you actually
have it? There's that other question, but I'm going to go there. How about a bear? Yeah. How
about you? More like the man who's talking in the woods and there's no woman here who's still wrong.
That was nicer, yeah. Okay. No, he's not wrong, actually. Okay, what's my name?
Oh, it's Gary, that's right. Let's see. If I can got my ex-drivers to work and video, so
it was a matter of I had a bunch of other old drivers who installed, I don't know how it was
best to make something for you, but it was pretty good learning process, so you shut down
the ex and remove all the stuff and then you install it and find the work tool. Yeah, another
little clue about the Nvidia stuff is use their uninstaller in their install script if you're
going to rip it out and put anything else in there, because any other way you want to install
that, it makes a mess. Yeah, use their uninstaller in the install script. There's an uninstaller
either used to be anyway, but you can use that same install script to uninstall, and it's
a good idea to do that, because any other way I've ever tried to change the driver's
card, went down. There's a bunch of remnants. End up with a bunch of remnants all over the
place, and you'll never get them all out. They will screw things up, especially the
DRI stuff. There's a program with an ending, just supposed to be the helper. No, just letter
end letter V. Oh, you're not talking about the driver. No, it's a program which is supposed
to help you to install these. I didn't want supplies, and it never worked for me. So it didn't
work. Yeah, the thing about those Nvidia drivers is they replaced some of the libraries
in higher PC, and they've packed all the old ones that are there. If you don't use their uninstaller
new replaces them with the originals, so those other drivers are then trying to use the
Nvidia supply thing. Oh, I see. So there's a bunch of stuff that's getting moved around
when you install this thing. Yeah, and the worst part of it is they named some of those
files the same thing, so that, you know, the names are the same. Yeah, that's a different
file with the same name. It's a little bad enough reading it, but a new one in the place.
And you don't know that. How do you guys find that out? Well, you can read that script.
No, it's not a read me, but if you can read the script, you'll see what it does, but it'll
take you wild. I'm sure it's it, bro. I think it's a shell script. Yeah, it's a shell.
It's one of those combination shell scripts and archives. Yeah,
yeah. So then like saw them and videos started acting up, so I don't know how to troubleshoot
that, so it goes into this real slow mode. Is it when you have multiple audio occupations
open? Probably is. Would it be the post audio? I've got that on there, but I don't think
you can use it. Maybe it will. It's on there usually. But you should actually have less
problems with pulse abuse. If you have problems with doing multiple sounds that
want to keep working. Yes, just probably. I don't know what caused that. I don't know what
I've changed. So, you know, a way to fix it that I've promised to shut down and now I'm
trying to, you know, it used to be an older version of the Bluetooth that I went before,
was that when the flash player did like whatever, if you were using some other audio
files, the flash player actually locked the audio input and any other input file of the
audio files could not actually play. That's where it is, because I've got a bunch of, you know,
nowadays it's pretty hard with void flash. Which version of flash are you using? I think
I don't know if it's the TAN or whatever. I just try to be, try to be out of the 64-bit.
You're probably using the 32-bit one, right? I'm assuming. I'm probably using just the
standard one. I'm their actual website building. Actually, it's in Adobe Labs. Adobe Labs.
This has got all of their like previously software and everything and they actually have a 64-bit
version of a flash. Oh, you install a Ubuntu 64 on your machine? Yeah, this is the AMD 64.
This is it. Okay, I got that. I'll show you. What it'll give you is just one of those
little flash.sl files and even just drop that in and use that instead. This one will work
so much better because with the 32-bit, you're going through another one of the wrappers.
To navigate from the 32-bit 64-bit, probably about 80% of the problems come from that
graphic versus the actual flash over that itself. I know that what that happened just
close your browser and to see if it's going to improve it. Yeah, I'll try that. I think that's
what happens. I have a bunch of stuff open on Opera. You know, there's so much flash
on all these other things. It's hard to avoid it. Do you ever type in the top in the
command line just to see what process is eaten up by me? I don't think use the most
system manager. I don't think that it's using all the system resources. I think it
blocks the audio resources. It grabs the input. Well, but the thing is with pulse,
there should be multiple inputs. So if another program starts up, it should be able
to just grab another endpoint from pulse and it doesn't matter if it don't be flash
grants that one. The other one should just be allowed through. It's not to say it's
not the problem. Yeah, so I just thought I was aiming it up and every so often it goes
out, it gets interrupted, it doesn't move. There's something that is stuck. You know,
doing too much of something in the background is useless. I think you can find out what
serve as you could just restart the service too. Can you start pulse on you?
Yeah, well, actually, it's just the damon that's running in the background. So if you
kill it, then the next thing that requests a sound will start back up. This is
the way it is. This would be better to have people to figure it out. Yeah, so just kill
pulse on you. Just go through here and try. Yeah, try shutting down
operative or Firefox, whatever. See if that makes any difference.
Okay, I think pulse isn't good too. Yeah, pulse audio. Okay.
Did you switch off that?
What? Yeah, you can do that any, you know, you just start typing.
Oh, okay. What do you just start typing? You just start typing.
Wait out here. Yeah. Let's see if my words...
What the hell did I get there? You just click in here and start typing.
What did I click? Just click in any box. Any...
Yeah, I'm going to show you guys what I'm talking about.
I'm going to pinch it.
Smooth.
If that's the photo for this beer.
Is it really? That should be.
Oh, nine.
You know her?
Wilder.
She related that wilder, that little temple.
So if I click on it...
No. No.
What is it?
What is it talking about?
What? Am I talking about it?
What are you talking about? I click on it.
Yeah, and then we'll start typing.
Yeah, see that goes.
There is pulse audio, sleeping.
I shouldn't read that in the lab.
It works with like open dialogues and everything too.
It works in just about every operating system.
Even if you're in X-floor or X-B, you start typing things.
It searches by the first character.
Everyday something new.
You know when you're in a terminal window, you get a terminal.
But if you type in a command like LS, is that actually a program that's running?
You're running the LS?
Well, LS is built into the shell.
But it is a program.
Yes.
If you look.
It's in the lower end.
And same with change directory.
You see all those are actually...
Some are built into the shell and some are actually...
If you look at it, you can show them all the...
Is it just been?
Yeah.
Because anything that's for just the base operating system is...
Oh, that's right.
I thought some of those were generated by the shell.
Some of them are...
LS is not...
LS is actually...
Oh, I thought it was.
They said actually a program.
Yes.
CD is not...
CD is part of shell.
So it will actually show...
Yes.
You can see like a Z-calc...
Wait.
Dutch.
What's the...
Green means what?
It's a program?
It's in the indication of the permissions.
Green means it's got executable permission.
Okay.
If you could see it in the left there.
It's got that X.
Drag the window to the right.
I'll see if you can see the full permissions.
We're doing our two hands on today.
This is awesome.
Okay, so...
Oh, it's not good.
Well, maybe you have to be waffling.
It's good.
Just play a one.
Okay, so...
Do you want to sit behind the wheel?
No, I don't.
Just take his computer.
We're trying to do that.
Let me get home.
Just give me a hold of the oven.
Green means it's got the X-cupel set.
It's not the beer smith.
The bright red problem is that it's got the...
Secret beer set.
It's set U-R-D.
The blue means that it's a link at some time.
And regular, I think,
black is a small pile.
And I don't know, usually...
It's a huge directory.
I don't know.
It's like a...
That's usually...
I'm still looking at the CLS.
It's a program.
That's not exactly the standard.
So you can set...
Yeah.
Or you can set it up or whatever you get.
Yeah.
I can tweak that.
I don't know about that.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The things I like, the Movelinix,
Best over any other shell based operating system
is the ability to auto-conflict,
which is really really nice.
That is...
It's only the shell.
Yeah, that's bass.
You know, when those actually are pretty simple,
it's just the right street setting.
It's needed in SCO 506 and 507.
It's only two.
I know.
I use other operating systems for work too much
and then you get the following.
Maybe I'm using IBM and stuff.
I think there is auto-complete, but I know exactly.
That probably has to do with the shell.
Yeah.
It's bass.
It's not...
You know, CSH doesn't have it.
I don't think KSH has it either.
I think it's just...
You could just install that.
Yeah.
I don't like that.
Yeah.
You should have...
There's some other...
CSH happen.
Does it?
Nah.
But yeah, like...
Do it...
Just like Type L.
Oh, there's two ways you can do that in your...
In your shell or C.
You might be able to set up an aliased for something.
Yeah.
So like, say for W.
You can't remember the name of a command.
Yeah.
It's a good demo for W.
Like, you could type TAP twice.
Type TAP twice.
And then it'll tell you 600 list all possibilities
of every command starting with that one.
Why didn't I know that?
That's what I said.
And then you can hit yes.
You can hit yes.
And then it will show you everything that starts with L.
So if you can't remember how to spell...
Locates.
You know, you can't remember how to spell longer
or locate or something like that.
So then you drill down more.
So then you hit Q for quits.
And then...
And if I would do...
Oh, attempt it.
And that does everything starting with L.
Oh.
You know.
Yeah.
There's only one option.
You've got a lot of capabilities.
Tap.
It kills it all.
Yeah.
Up to that option.
It's also if you get specific enough.
If you start to get lazy with typing and stuff,
it's a way that you can complete commands faster too.
So like if you have a long string of 50 characters
or something that you're typing in,
you can type in one, two, three, four characters, TAP.
You know, which auto completes it because it's specific enough.
And then it starts to type the next one, TAP.
You know, pipe, start to type the next one, TAP.
And then it's for good.
And then as you develop all your commands.
And as you get used to it and stuff,
you can whip out these commands a lot faster.
And then you really start to do things faster.
If you start creating regular routines,
then you set up aliases.
And you set up, like, you know,
create your own little scripts that do all of this.
And that's, you know,
which else scripts to do your dump,
you know, go gather all the log files for the day
and then dump them to a printer or dump them to your email or,
you know, whatever.
Hmm.
I didn't know that.
I mean, I knew about auto complete.
I didn't know about TAP, TAP.
Look at your .bash RC.
I'm not going to show it.
.born.
Can't teach if you won't cooperate.
Let's look at the bash.rc.
Where is it located?
It's in your home directory.
Oh, it's in a .bash RC.
Say, say less, you know,
less city space to lead.
Yeah.
Not just computers.
Less .bash RC.
Less.
Yeah, yes.
Or more.
Oh, you want to see it.
Yeah, that says more.
I don't know.
RC.
Just that.
Oh, I thought it would do.
And if you go down to the end of the file,
it even suggests an aliases.
So you can have lb list.
See, look at the little bit more.
See, it says aliase definitions.
And if you uncomment those,
ll will give you the long listing.
L.A. will give you the old dash A.
Now, ls dash A listing.
And you can set up any number of those, too.
See, you set up your own.
You can write the command in 41.
Make a new command, the lsd4 or something like that.
And that represents a great big moment of strain.
Save the keystroke.
Let's say, I think that it's work we have ll as a little bit
global aliase, which is ls dash A.
L, too.
We could alias something that rm star dash r dash A.
I think that's what I'll do tonight.
Yeah.
Just that.
Just that.
Good time.
Just be sure to sing your sticky bit.
May everything first.
May I borrow your computer?
You just set the sticky bit on the rm.
Well, that won't only protect the rm command from being deleted.
Because the sticky bit will say that when you run the rm command,
it will run as whatever the owner of the files is.
So if you have the rm command, they own a rug, which it is,
when you run rm, it'll give you rug permissions.
So no matter who you are, they'll get rug permissions when you run
and can be delivered every while.
Well, depending on how sticky it's set up.
So you can change it.
You can change it.
You can change it.
Yeah.
I guess change the rm command.
Like a hundred.
By just changing these permissions.
Yes.
Well, you can change it so that when rm is run,
it automatically gets super user privileges.
No password.
Yeah.
No password.
No sudo.
It's just your rug.
Go.
It doesn't have to.
It doesn't have to.
It doesn't have to.
Oh.
Because it automatically gives you whatever permissions.
It's not necessarily all of that.
It's the way it's set up.
There's so much for it.
Yeah.
Well, you can set up your sudoers too.
That's one of the recommended.
Yeah.
Actually, if you look here, the two that are red,
you want to unknowing them and then s u.
When you run s u, it runs as broad, which then
allow you to get rough access.
It's just like similar.
It's changed usually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Easily doing a song of chair mom.
All right.
So you want to be able to run s u as normal as a program.
And then that's so that we get back to the rescue.
Yeah.
Well, that makes total sense.
So when I run s u, it's just as if I was at the ground,
or the laundry truck and type it.
Yeah.
And now it's getting over and asking for permission.
That actual program.
Well, yes, the program.
Right.
But the program is running as well at that point.
Yeah.
So it won't let you make it out.
The program is limited on purpose because it's rescue security.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Unmall, they just have that.
So that you can simply unknowing some of the introduction.
Yup.
Okay.
Anything else happen?
No.
Not too much.
Nothing.
As they do with this video.
Okay.
So, okay.
So I was on the block.
How about you?
How was the baby?
Still breathing?
She's breathing a lot.
Who I do and that's all I do with that English.
Yeah.
Not a baby.
So from our family members, we come to a machine for my mom.
We get back the case.
Okay.
We're going to have one server in it.
One server back in it.
So it's so long you're going to be suspended from the ceiling with a fishing line.
Actually, right now, my mom ran a machine in a case that doesn't fit in and started out with a screwdriver.
Are you expecting your mom to be able to do that?
No.
Yeah.
She has a pretty good screwdriver.
Exactly.
We said.
Do you want to speak to your father or your mother to work with him?
We're injured together.
Let's talk about this.
Okay.
Okay.
What is it?
You can have a server if you want to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It works unless you're on the phone.
You need a case.
Don't.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Do you find the fan?
Yeah.
I did it.
I found a fan but not one.
It was great for the same kind of keeping the feedback.
So you have to keep the feedback from it.
Yeah.
There's a few.
So I ended up leaving the open fan on there just by a case fan.
I put on the case and put that one in.
It's a key fan.
It's a lot of metal.
We did everything.
It's a lot of metal.
It's a lot of metal.
It's a little bit of a fan that was dying.
It's a horrible number on it.
The process is a little over here.
I think you don't know.
No.
It might just run till summer and then.
It's going to happen.
A lot of stuff, man.
It doesn't actually happen.
Yeah.
It's very weird.
You hear it before.
You hear it before.
Yeah.
It dies a lot of times.
Anybody?
I don't know.
The phone's on.
Yeah.
Very impressive.
What does it do?
The backup.
It's pulling.
The phone partition is right.
It's a little bit of a spoiler.
It's just going to end.
The movie could be a part of the car.
It's going to end.
The movie could be a part of the car.
It's going to end.
The same thing we've had in the box.
There's one of the poster problems.
That I actually put in the next thing.
So I'll call it the NB.
When they tell the word.
The word of the long sentence.
It's a very nice software.
I think it's all a fairly nice software.
The thing be as it goes the line with another planet.
That's useful for work.
I want to talk about one heart drive.
From another hand, who can just open and drift?
Why?
It's a垢.
A little bit that I can't re-produce.
Yeah, that's what it is-
I said.
That's what I can't reproduce it.
No problem.
Yeah, it's supposed to be tapy.
You know.
But fill me your insult.
Whatever.
I don't know that somewhere along the line, it caused the correct errors to happen that come up to be sure to start on.
So the same way as the internet is forward, so I need to be told to be there.
And when I find a certain fixing stuff, I'm sure it's there.
Oh, bitter, are we?
Anyways, that earpiece clone zone before we're here, backing up the machines.
It's pretty slick.
I must do it on the same kind of thing that the system in the restored is.
But it's very manual and it's a bit more people in operating systems and fear out of view.
Clone zone is like, what do you want to do?
Let's go to that and see if you guys know.
I would agree, I used it and it's very...
Yeah.
Let's hold it.
No, right, thank you.
Oh, I do, I'll hand.
I've been pretty busy lately.
I've been playing around a little bit with the back seat.
Getting out, moving back on.
Yeah, did you get it back?
There was already clip-out it.
Yeah, it's on the SSVs, which I suppose you could have done along.
I didn't want to be working on the SSVs.
Have you gotten the back work in here?
I think so.
If go back, we'll actually run the system in our crash.
I just wanted to say hardware.
So I just downloaded the latest 534.
0.9.9.5324.
So you just downloaded that?
Just saying.
Oh, that's why we saw the error in our stream.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello there.
Actually, there is downloading, downloading...
Oh, no, boxy.
Wait until I start streaming my Netflix stream a little bit.
Halfway through it.
I get the floor, but the name is letter.
Then you really see your stress.
E2-11-N is going to destroy your network.
Yeah, we've got it by the way.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
So, was it hard to set up that artist's feature?
It's super easy.
You do it online.
You are.
You have your pizza.
So you need to be actually a reduced user on a little website.
You do it.
You have your boxy website under your account, but you also...
Actually, no, you don't need to be able to.
Yeah, you don't have to sign in, do you?
No.
Where do you pull the feed list from?
Is it on the blue list?
The list.
You have to do it by showing the video.
What's your average?
If you go with the link to RSS,
we've said this,
ice rating videos,
and those videos.
Okay.
So then you show also this video.
So there's a community
that's going to be used to be with the ADI.
No, not really.
Good.
Good words.
Cool.
So is the feed that you are out
when you're in there?
Is it the...
Yeah, right there.
You are out.
That's right.
But I've also been moving it
to the stall on DC Linux on a PSP.
It's seen as more than
a bad way to show you.
Is there a good one?
That's good for it.
I thought it would be a cool
YouTube.
That's one of the PSP.
That would be cool for it.
PSP.
Is that the Sony?
The PSP.
You already have a PSP?
Yeah.
But I guess it's our custom fur pointer.
In that case,
you have to pay at least a big email
by the top of the research program
and the second battery,
so you have a lot of money.
What do you...
Of that,
do you still...
Is already a recombyle for that architecture?
Yes.
There is a distribution for the PSP.
It doesn't mean...
I'm not really sure how...
How useful it is.
I haven't been able to find many...
That was open.
Or a screenshot.
Right.
I want to see a video of the...
The...
The blue screen.
You know...
Show me your face,
which I didn't think was...
Pretty much the way it works is...
There's one distribution of DC links
and then their build scripts
build up from all the different architectures.
So,
the one that you're getting on the PSP
is going to be the exact same version
that you get.
The idea of earning the versus
some other piece of product.
Oh, I guess they did.
There's a...
There's a site piece,
and it's going to be just...
So they probably provide an already piled version of that.
But possibly...
Actually,
I'm not sure.
It looks like the site
is so secure for you.
And building this machine.
Ah, okay.
So, what would be our investment there?
Getting the registered protocol and the battery
to install it on the firmware
that will allow you to install
the router based on that.
This guy is providing a pre-built package.
What's the battery?
What are you heading for?
Well,
it's something with the PSP.
You have that special battery
to
you
flash
the firmware
with the PSP.
Which allows you
to install a custom printer.
Is it
open
the firmware in the battery?
No,
it's actually...
I am holding here.
I can tell you what it is.
It's by design.
That's how
the PlayStation actually
is also for the wireless...
Wow.
Good.
I have something
open.
It's the battery you can
if you could use it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just plug it in.
I can't wait to open.
I can't wait to open.
I can't wait to open.
I can't wait to open.
I can't wait to open.
I can't wait to open.
We're going to be finding three builds.
Jackson M-A-E.
It was the first build that I had.
Yeah.
Oh, that's where I was.
Is it the brother of Michael Jackson?
He can have some more answers
or people that they saw.
He's able.
What if he's running out of money?
Probably from all that stuff.
He's done a drill.
He's trying to do
another world's job too.
I don't know.
It's safe.
Yeah.
I've heard you were selling the old noses
on each day.
That's fine.
That's fine.
Okay.
He's fit right now.
I don't know.
I think that some of the news
is that the downloads were
back up.
So I wonder if maybe the downloads were
down or something.
Oh, do you see loose?
Yeah.
That was Jackson M-A-E.
So he is good.
He's going to be selling the downloads
or something.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Cool.
Thank you.
How are you?
If you want to share anything with us.
How are you?
I'm pretty new to me.
It's obviously.
I haven't really done too much.
I just have to go around.
It's all.
Cool.
It's all that is scary too much.
We do all this fancy stuff.
But we really have no idea what we're doing.
Yeah.
It's just hoping screens.
Yeah.
Basically we all make up a whole bunch of stuff.
Yeah.
There's a bit more stuff than I actually.
You learn the process, right?
But most of us get employed.
So you know.
We have a pay attention too.
But you know, that's not a lot.
Now that's why we're an excuse that you're starving.
Because we wanted to exchange information about how we do stuff.
This is the class that you always wanted to take in college.
That you know whenever offered.
That actually is like relevant contents.
That's interesting in your school.
Same time.
Oh, you always think that that's really relevant and interesting?
Yes.
That's right.
And most of the education is about it.
And if I get offered a suggestion, if you want us to help set up a printer,
no, he has a best job.
Nobody can know that we're laptops.
Oh.
We can all demo 400 sheets.
Lots of it's 150 pounds.
Yeah.
Which is fine.
I'm just saying we have something like that.
It'd be best if it's here so we can go to it.
Yeah.
The concept is going to be hard sometimes.
Yes.
Well, it would be easier if you were to have a lockdown to bring in here.
Yeah.
You know, laptop.
But I just remember you used it in your school.
Yes.
You just bought it.
Didn't really change anything.
You just worked on anything.
So it's just raining and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, you know, you all want to welcome to come here and ask any question you might have.
We have a IRC.
There's nobody on it.
Just be.
As you can see, the price of the stream is up.
And hello.
And nobody said anything.
So I guess we don't have anybody.
So.
Well, we're all speaking over the side.
There's nobody on there.
There's people.
There are different channels.
There are spots.
Actually, no.
These aren't spots.
I don't know who's this person, but I know all these people.
Oh, those aren't people.
So they have people out there on the house.
Yeah.
But it is, let's say they are running it as a background process.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So for all those crappy stuff, he does magical just out the wide country.
Yeah.
No, but what are you guys talking about over there?
He asked about IRAs sleep.
Okay.
And I just had a sense for unit relay checks and everything that you can open up a link from the website to the website.
Yeah.
The web lab
Is it you?
We're going there without.
Yeah.
It is really.
It is.
If you click on it, you don't actually want to visit out a window with a wet IRC client.
It's kind of a bold school way of a lot of different people on the internet.
They're around them for quite a while.
Yeah, it's just experience.
It will generate your big name, but a tiny stop.
If the bulletin board systems and such, then there's a lot of bulletin.
Where are the channels too?
Oh, an IRC IRC?
Up there too.
Yeah, there is a...
There is a...
The most popular is IRC.
Probably set up a picture.
Yeah.
Begin.
Picture is from the program.
Yeah.
About the least.
You will be surprised.
This article has the most hits.
Wow.
That's why it's the most popular.
I like 3000 hits.
These are...
Still...
Still people will know there.
Yeah.
Well, mostly people are getting there from the searches.
Yeah.
What's the thing about search engine optimization?
Once you get the content there, it's actually the core.
Yeah.
Correctly.
It's even if you don't want the traffic, it's pretty hard to get rid of it.
Yeah.
Once you're there, you're there.
You want to be or not.
But most people want to be there.
What's the downside of being at the top?
Yeah.
Cool.
Server traffic.
Where are you going to school?
Uh, CTC.
Oh, good.
Cool.
Yeah.
Tell us if they have any Linux resources.
Um, not really.
But, uh, I'm taking an operating system as far as...
What a core and where...
Uh, I can program.
I just...
Is there still a co-volve class?
Yeah.
Oh, darn.
No, that in the 1980s.
No, no.
I was there.
2,000.
Two thousand.
And still have a co-volve.
Yes, he has.
There was not a co-volve class.
There was not a co-volve class.
I used to have a co-volve class.
Yeah.
Oh, darn.
You missed that.
No, that in 1980.
No, no.
I was there.
Yeah, there was no there was no high class. I used to not do high.
Well, yeah, glad to have you here as I said if you have any questions, so come down here and hang with us.
And just have a good time and learn stuff.
Yeah, it was basically just that one networking thing with Fedora.
But I tried to get this one guy that you went to the networking side.
And he tried to help me with it and kind of figure out what it was about and so on.
Yes, you might have more like the try the live CD.
If that CD doesn't work, try to download it to bit.
Yeah, yeah.
That's always the difference between Ubuntu and Fedora.
And in that case, Fedora is okay, we are only going to include stuff.
That is a draw the line, only free.
Where's Ubuntu, we'll just get it work.
Yeah, we think that wireless drivers are important.
So that's why even though it might not be free as a source, we still let it close our eyes and we have it provided to you.
Yeah, we might tell you that it's a free, but you have an option to install it.
Wait, so they like pay for that?
No, it's not free.
No, there's two different tanks of free.
Free is a beer, I provide a beer.
Right.
He doesn't tell you how to make the beer.
Oh, I can tell me.
Wow, you're not going to do it at the same time.
There's free is a beer, whereas you give the product away, but you don't say how to make it.
And then there's free is a freedom where if you give the product away, here's how you make it.
You don't want to do it.
Then you can change it if you want.
And when Fedora is talking about free, they're talking about a free source.
Well, there might be a free program, but we still, in open source world or Linux world,
we might tell you that they have non-free programs.
It doesn't mean that you have to pay for them, just there's no source going to it.
Right.
And really, the reason for that is so you don't give them a situation where somebody provides a program for free.
Everybody starts using it, and then the conversion comes out, and now it costs $20 dollars to download it.
It's open source.
You can try and try to get $20 dollars for it, but this other guy has the code for it too.
He's going to compile it and say, here you go.
It's free.
Why things do I look for it when you get it being free?
Well, a lot of people, yes and no.
A lot of people take open source as a collaboration.
You know, so you solicitate somebody's ideas through the open source development.
So a lot of people are passionate about whatever they are coding for.
And A, they might not be able to code as much, or B, they don't just say, yeah, solicits the data in collaboration.
Different ideas help make it better.
So you have some open source programs, just open source, and then how people make money
is the approach providing a follow-up service.
Let's say WordPress.
WordPress is a blog inside Flare, and you can download WordPress free and install it on your own computer.
But there's also WordPress hosting provider.
So you can actually get, if you have WordPress you want to host it somewhere, you can go to WordPress, and you can host it over there.
And then you pay them for five or eight dollars a month.
So then it's actually a voluited proposition.
So you don't pay for a software, you have to pay for the razor blades, if you want to.
To do.
And then they can, programmers can make money because you can be hired to do a program, and for someone in an open source program,
that they couldn't do themselves.
That's another way programs will make money.
And then you also have the angle of support contracts that companies will set up to support open source software with the earliest things that they can do.
And you are right.
Let's say like, you know, there's a lot of into this economy.
But there's a lot of fair and large companies which are hiring people who are working on open source.
And the way how to get hired is not to write a resume, but to write a code.
And so then you actually have your projects there.
And somebody's interested in the area.
So guess what?
They'll find you because you're writing it.
Okay.
Let's move on.
Hello.
Things I did this week.
I created a Facebook group.
Yeah, really.
I'm clear.
Let me ask you.
Staying away from Facebook.
I don't want any of that code that produces a machine.
You have to restrict the kind of programs that you put on those pages.
And it's safe to go there.
I went right out.
I used it for years.
I don't have any problems with it.
I don't know if there's any actual dangers or the dirty things.
So I say may only house.
I've never read the rest of it.
You know the math on the side.
I'm on again.
I'll have to figure out how to walk again.
You get no script.
No.
All you got to do is.
Yeah, right.
Do you see?
Well, yeah.
Seven members on the Facebook group.
Yeah.
Seven dollars to set it up.
Seven members.
No, seven members.
Oh, great.
I mean, it doesn't cost anything.
Didn't really do a whole lot with Linux.
It's like, I'm working with a friend today and trying to fix his exchange server.
I found it that it was interesting that from within Linux, you can use a login.
There's a plug-in for login with Firefox that you can take control over Windows machine.
If need be.
From Linux.
From within a browser.
So.
So.
I don't know if it goes through.
What more does it have then?
It's probably the same thing.
Yeah, it's like a VNC base.
But it's a web app.
And it's a plug-in for Firefox, but it downloads to get it.
But do you have anything on the PC you're connecting to?
Yeah.
Okay.
It's just.
Yeah.
It's like a plug-in with that.
So like from the, you know, from the machine, the cloud connects it up.
And then from the hosts out to the cloud makes the connection for.
I've seen as much as like a 98% saving.
I saw 42 inch LCD go for 46 dollars.
Yes.
That's the current bid price.
Just look at mine.
No bother.
When does it end?
It ends when the timer goes out.
But the interesting thing about this is.
Two seconds left.
Yep.
Yeah.
But the interesting thing is with this site, every time someone makes it bid,
if it's a penny, if it's a penny bidding system, then they'll just increase the price by a cent.
Or it'll be on normal options that will increase it by 15 cents.
But it also adds 15 seconds to the counter of how much time is left.
So it creates a sense of urgency because every time someone bids it adds 15 seconds.
And then it counts down from 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, and then someone bids again.
And the other interesting thing is about this is that you have to buy bids.
And bids by default in the packs are 75 cents per bid.
So that's how they make money.
Like you bid on things which cost you small amounts of money.
But in the end, you know, the combination of the bids plus the item itself is drastically reduced.
You know?
So like, I've been watching.
So like, there's a way some.
But if you lose the auction, you still have to pay for the bids, yeah.
So don't bid unless you want to.
You pay per bid, yeah.
So basically they're making their money because there could be a hundred people bidding.
There could be a thousand people bidding.
So if they aren't getting it, you're right.
Exactly.
And what does it have to do with the auction?
It's easier.
Right.
It's down to five seconds.
So like, it's down to five seconds.
So I'm looking at, like, the Samsung 40 inch 1080p 120 hertz LCD TV.
Recently sold for $163 for a 40 inch LCD.
You know?
So.
So someone's like the water.
It's really, it's an interesting thing.
It's not a surprise, but everybody's pitching in for it.
That's what I was going to say to you.
That's what I was going to say, $300.
Oh, I would, but it was one of the odds.
Actually, the $200.
There you go.
You have to do, like, two-clock in the morning.
That's the counter comes down.
If the bid is less than the value of what people think it is,
they can still have a bid, even at $200.
Somebody did a bid.
So do you think there's people sitting there or is this,
and some automatically he bade you can set up?
Well, there's a bid butler that you can set up.
So like, you can bid from a certain dollar amount to a certain dollar amount,
with a number of bids if you want to do that.
And then there's what's called a nail witer.
Nail witer ones, which disallow bid butlers,
or disallow the automatic reading ones.
So then those are the ones where people are actually clicking bid every single time.
So that was kind of interesting.
It'll show on the bid butler section on the right-hand side
if you click on any individual item.
Yeah, if you click on one of those,
and if you have JavaScript enabled.
Oh, come on.
Can you go into that?
Please don't broder, broder, then it's going to be tight.
Yeah.
Picsically, definitely.
That's a wild, great image individually.
The internet.
What is going on?
What is going on?
You're just wanting a text project.
Yeah, what?
I'm so blind.
Yeah, let's just go with links.
That's a great save.
I'm sharing with you.
Next one is user group.
It's going to be a link.
I've got a really, really old CD.
I think it's got the original web browser on.
To bring that in, you can install it.
I think I can.
I hope people have their alt tanks that are well-seated.
You can read what the heck you're doing.
I think it's images.
Yeah.
Sort of.
Yes, he.
Not style sheets.
Yeah.
But yeah.
So, yeah.
That's a new question.
Do you have a vision to do it that way?
In the top right-hand corner, and usually it shows you the bid butler option.
If you want to do that.
And then that's kind of x'd out, if it's like a nail-biter option.
Or is this a bid?
He can't see it because it's all their sucks.
When?
No.
Why don't we look at it?
It doesn't actually show up.
Actually, scroll down.
No, I take it back.
It is there.
Scroll down a little bit.
It's bidding history.
I'll wait a minute.
Or is it?
Is that it?
It looks similar.
It's called a bid butler.
It looks like that.
Right there.
Oh.
A bid butler.
It shows you a range.
Yeah.
Yeah, it'll bid from your low range to your high range.
With the number of bids that you put in your range.
If you wanted to do that.
Now, you don't have to do that.
So, will that bid right away?
It will bid.
The bid butler will.
So, we need to bid automatically when there's less than 10 seconds to go.
So, and the other interesting thing is.
I might have to be out of bonster.
Well, I don't know.
I'm maximizing that.
What?
What else about it?
It's a window.
To turn off the scripts pops up and moves it down.
There.
Now, I'm trying.
Grab the bottom.
Yeah.
Click once.
Just grab the bottom.
There we go.
Good it.
That's good stuff.
Telling you, I'm going to give this four yet.
Well, on this page, you see that?
There, four down.
No.
Because I don't know.
What?
Okay.
There in the box, right now.
Oh, man.
It's down to 15 seconds.
Click once.
I don't have 75 cents, do you?
No.
Well, I'm sure there's a lot of people bid about that.
So, 50.
You register, and then we can bid next time.
How about that?
It's free to register.
So, you actually got mine.
I'm busy.
I just thought it was interesting.
No, I just thought it was something interesting to learn.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, you have to.
Right.
Yeah, you can end up wasting five bucks on the chart.
I think the intelligence thing, you have to watch it.
Under the picture of the item on the left hand side.
Yeah.
There's a link that's as recently sold for, and then it says a certain amount.
So, that's about the average price that things will be sold.
So, you watch that.
Well, what I would do, if I was bidding, and I know I would start to bid when it gets close to that average items price.
And the timers low.
So, you have to wait for the timer to be low, and for the price to be near that item in order to see what the going rate is worth.
And again, you have to be registered.
So, it shows up like.
Yeah.
So, like this TV, recently sold for $163.16.
For that TV.
For that TV.
Okay, so how many pennies make $163?
Oh, it's good.
Oh, it's good.
How many bid do you have to do?
Well, I know, but if it starts at a penny and it was sold for $163, that's $163.
I had to post a thousand bid.
Yeah, and that means we've got a thousand 75 cents for every one of those bids.
So, I think it was up in the increase.
On this particular one, you know, it's 2448 divided by 15 cents.
We'll give you the number of bids, times 75 cents, which is the cost of the bid.
That's what I'm saying.
To get to this bidding item to this bidding place.
So, I see how they make money in it.
Oh, yeah.
Even if they sell it at a fourth of the retail, you know, they're consumer wins
because they're getting something cheap.
And the site wins because they're raking in the money.
It's all the same.
Like a lot of them.
Yeah.
And not getting it.
I'm calling it double-lipping, that's all it is.
It's just, it's kind of an interesting site.
It should be three basically.
It should just be just bid on it.
And then it's $163.
It doesn't get the site any money, though.
It doesn't, I mean, the site is going to massively lose money.
If they're not people, they're going to lose money if it's free.
Okay.
Well, it's losing money because it's a small lot.
Oh, right.
They're not going to buy money.
What do you see there?
Yes.
No.
I mean, if you get paid, all you're doing is paying for your clicks.
And you say the item is free.
You just have to pay for clicks to try to get it.
You're also paying for a shipping distribution.
The cost of running the website.
The bandwidth.
No, I'm not saying if you, if you said gave it away free,
you'd have more people bidding a 75 cent click.
Hey, you got a lot of bid.
I mean, probably give away free.
Well, the only thing you're paying the 75 cents per click
and I give away free.
Whoever wins it gets it for free.
But is that going to be you?
So that's new law.
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.
It's like, let's talk about X.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let me make money for X.
Yeah.
That's why.
That's more law.
I'm not lying here.
You know, you're in a web browser.
Back in 1996.
Oh, I'll get it.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Anything else?
That's it.
It's still the disrespect for your screen.
Oh.
One million dollars.
Cool.
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
Wow.
How about you guys?
Well, let's see.
Good.
Peace and news for Gary who's asking about Twitter
and the Kepler Spacecraft, which is the one that's going to be looking for Earth-like planets out there,
is using Twitter Tweets to for NASA to send back mission status reports.
I heard that was quite interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The other thing is mission critical.
It is now.
The other thing is that the password experiment was a complete failure.
Fast zip-grack generated 5,000 positive passwords and when we ran the dictionary script to check
them, none of them was the password.
So we've now graduated with A-Zipper and an article by these two guys who developed that
CRC method of shortening the thing and trying to penetrate the inner meaning of that article
and understand what we have to do to get it done in a couple of hours.
You are determined.
Oh, I will get it eventually.
What happened is that you zip something and you don't remember the password.
But someone sent you a version of a program that was the version I wanted that's no longer available.
And somewhere along the line there, I lost the email that it came with and I don't know what the password was.
This was a guy in India who was probably killed in the Mumbai massacre.
I have no idea where he is or how to get back in touch with him.
So I have to crack the file or I just won't even get at it.
Did you try to like to know?
No, I tried all the obvious silly things and I don't know.
But the program maybe looked on the internet.
Well, yeah, the program originally was nice.
It was bought by somebody.
It's now proprietary and it's been completely changed and I don't like it.
I walked under the early version side.
And the other thing we did is we finally got, or I finally got free WRL,
the work on my Ubuntu machine because the way it comes, you can't build a dead well.
And for that particular one, I guess I won't say you couldn't, but the script to build a dead package doesn't work.
It makes some of the things and then it crafts out before it actually finishes making the dead package.
So I had problems with the dependencies, which I finally worked them all out and now I get it.
So we're trying to build a dead.
So we're trying to create a package.
Yeah, well, when you get the source, you could just build it and create a dead package.
But I got as far as building stuff and halfway through creating the dead packaging that goes out.
So there was something in the dead package making part that doesn't work.
And it has to do with, let's see what was where I finally find these had to do with.
There was one of the pang on the dependencies that Ubuntu puts in a version.
That's one of the special Ubuntu patched versions and it wouldn't work.
I always found it interesting going and treating it to try to build a package.
But there's not a lot of info.
Not a lot of people are talking about the dead package.
So A is obvious or B is secret.
And so I was always intrigued.
Well, there is a padded build with that package out to all the dead inside of the building.
But the only way I've ever done it is with scripts that build them here.
And over RPMs, there's a file called spec file.
And what you do in the spec file, it's almost like a configuration file.
And then there's command RPM build and it reads that spec file.
From there, it picks everything up.
It takes your source, compiles it all, creates everything, going there.
I'm assuming that that means.
But that means actually, I think what they say is that it's better because it has stricter rules so that it makes it harder.
But then your end result is more guaranteed to work than RPMs are.
Yes, you have some kind of like recipe file in the pack.
Just templates for dead files.
But anyway, it was nice because that Cortona, the VRML viewers, I don't know.
It's not as nice.
It's got a bunch of crazy looking buttons and stuff that I don't like.
So this is a really nice slick little, you know, viewer window in this.
I was working on trouble.
Free WRL.
To VRML, for sure, reality model, language, all.
Free WRL.
Yeah.
WRL, just know it.
WRL, like this.
Yeah, that's it.
Actually, it's all big here.
Cool, but it's a nice little VR.
You know, I was telling you, I was using that not plot to make little, not, you know, not images.
It's a nice way to look at dots.
It's a nice way to look at dots.
Yeah.
Oops.
It's a not a way to look, you know, like I said.
Not like a trigger or not from a screen or not.
Yeah, I'm not a topography for dots and stuff, you know.
I like to fiddle around with that.
Cool.
Thank you.
I took my daughter to the Planetarium on the UW-Clarke Campus last Saturday.
It was really awesome.
I learned a lot more out of the time.
She did.
That's why she has this.
She could ask.
Yeah.
It was really awesome.
So if anybody has kids that, I think, you know, definitely be worth it to go to Saturdays and kids show.
You can talk about why the constellations are in the way, you know.
My story is from a big confology.
What time is it?
Early afternoon?
11.
I don't know.
Okay.
That's all it's got to do with that.
Check the website.
I don't know what the schedule is.
I just got it out of the volume one.
So I don't know exactly.
I just knew what it was.
I don't know if it's like every Saturday or Wednesday.
I don't know what it was.
Planetarium here.
Yeah.
If you're interested in astronomy, there's a real nice astronomy website.
So it happens above anybody ever used that.
You can actually put in your GPS, you know, coordinates.
And it will give you viewing operation for various things for where you are.
Saturdays.
It's actually for the show.
It's 7 p.m.
Yeah.
There's different shows for different age groups.
The one Saturdays for like four-year-olds.
Or as well.
Probably right there.
Yeah.
So.
Let me take a break.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Oh, yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
Only five.
No more words.
Yeah.
I know.
I'm really.
They listen really well.
They do.
They do.
They do.
They do.
Because everybody...
I wear out chases.
Yes, everybody's drinking, uh, green.
There's a lot of chases in snakes.
Yep.
So is that dominole or is that up above?
Just the dominole.
I'm since Dom be gone.
Yeah.
From the lowercipants.
Yeah.
You know what the observatories on the building?
Yes.
Well, look through the dominole.
And not any smaller buildings.
I don't know if they have a skateboard.
We think water streets, probably down to the end of the location, which it doesn't show anything.
Yeah, it doesn't show anything.
Yeah, turning your face to the next block.
You're almost at the end.
You take a right state.
You turn the state into the next block.
And then take another right.
You're right there.
Here it is.
Here it is.
You're looking at it.
It's a little longer than it looks.
Do you know states?
How about here?
I don't even know states.
I have to follow my state.
I don't know.
There's water.
Water is taking water.
And it's like that bridge.
That's a walking bridge.
That's five-hops.
And the battery for right there kind of is.
Right.
See the dome on the building?
Where's the arena?
Over there.
Show where we are right now.
You should go this way.
We should go this way.
You should go this way.
You can cross the bridge.
You can park in that lot by the fine arts building and walk across the bridge.
There's parkings free on Saturdays.
There's parkings.
You can go to park right next to it.
You can park actually back in here.
That's all old.
And the bonus is if you're going, well obviously go to all schools and you can go into the student center and for 625 attacks you can get all you can eat food.
You're going to kick in like cafeteria.
Up on top, I'm hoping.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
And in the main student you can get all the trash.
I can't at hilltop and the end of the season.
All I know is 625 and kids are free and for like 12 bucks we fed the head like all the food we could possibly want to eat.
They had made food.
They would get his money and serve him so whenever I try this.
Yeah.
That was awesome.
I found like a little hunter buffet.
A cheater.
Way cheaper.
So that's where we go.
The battle of families.
I didn't tap it.
I didn't tap it.
I didn't tap it.
It was calm or worried I forget.
You see Google, heaven's up?
I'd recommend it to anybody that's good.
That's how I saw it.
A che.
A che.
A che av.
You want to tap it?
Typing back is, and I don't know if it's, yeah, that's it, first hit.
It's a very nice astronomy site.
If you can set it up to have your specific location,
and that's what you want to use together.
Yeah, it will give you sky maps and satellite sightings
if anybody's into your radium flares,
the radiums are those telecommunication satellites,
and they have great big wing solar arrays.
And they will sometimes catch the sun.
And you can, they're so bright.
You can see that they're like minus six on, you know,
the scale of star brightness.
This is, I mean, zero is like a very, very bright star.
Yeah.
And these are like minus six.
They get brighter as they get more minus.
And they're so bright, you can see them in the daylight.
I mean, they're just, these flashes, yeah.
I'd probably account for about 90% of the UFO sightings.
Yeah.
And it's amazing.
I mean, I've seen them and they are absolutely astonishing.
And this will give you all the locations and, you know,
the time and exactly what elevation and asmeth look at and so on.
So, is that a GPS stop?
No, that's a telecommunication satellite.
That's it.
It was one of the ones that hit the Chinese satellite.
Yeah.
It was really in six.
It was in Russian satellite.
No, I think it got right.
Oh, it's another thing.
Everybody here, all the astronauts in this space station
had a climb into the Soyuz escape capsule today because
there was a piece of debris that came to place close to the station.
So, they were afraid because it was a very erratic orbit.
So, they all had a climb into the escape capsule for a few hours
to make sure that this thing was passed.
When the Sun was coming at you at 30,000 miles a second,
you get out of the way.
Yeah.
It was active.
The size of the thing is incredible.
It was only three tenths of a centimeter.
Yeah, it was like a bolt.
I think it was decided.
It was a bolt from a Titan launch vehicle and something like that.
Yeah.
And especially if they're going, you know, like this,
because it's like orbit velocity is 17,000 miles an hour.
So, you get up into 37,000 miles an hour.
That's like maybe five times.
It was a velocity of most good.
Now we've got space to pull it correctly.
It would be up there anymore, huh?
That's what they're saying in a few years.
Yeah. Well, there was actually a study done
that if we collide a few more satellites,
we're going to literally be at Earthbound.
We can forget about any exploration
because there's going to be a cloud of lethal particles,
you know, encircling the Earth.
In fact, have you ever seen that job attract?
You know, that job, what is it called?
J.H.U. or whatever.
But there's a NASA site where they actually
you can show all the satellites.
I mean, it's just, I mean, it's comical.
I mean, it's just, it looks like you can hardly see the globe, you know,
for all these great dots.
Yeah.
It's just amazing how many satellites are up there.
But it's it.
You could actually get trapped onto a critical point.
Every thing will start hitting.
It's going to be like a chain reaction.
And all the satellites will be destroyed.
It'll just be a whole bunch of junk flooring on there.
It reminds me of that video a couple of weeks ago
when police camera caught a small meteor hitting Earth.
You guys see that?
Oh, yeah.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.
Well, there was some entry from the satellite collision.
There was some entry, you know,
there was some debris that people saw coming in.
It's like a little meteor shot.
Yeah.
You just got to send some up there that can absorb the impacts.
Call that stuff up.
They'll all jump around.
First of all, there's much more space up there than you think.
I mean, there'd be absolutely technologically no way
to sweep that stuff out of there.
It was just no way.
I mean, it was exactly right over the wall.
And you have to go around here.
They can't even...
They're only tracking like about 60% of what's up there
because it's just mathematically impossible to track it.
That's why I think it wouldn't be practical.
I think it wouldn't be practical.
There was a reason for Star Wars for all of this
and all the money that they spent on that.
Now, they can just take their giant laser and paper eyes along the moon.
Well, there's a great...
Oh, boy.
...that illustrates that on the movie.
And it's like, you know, there's a guy that's explaining this to the president.
And the president asks, well, you know,
how could we not have seen this coming further out?
And then the guy's like, well, our budget allows for us to walk
like only 2% of the sky.
And pardon the expression, but it's a big ass guy.
Cool.
And we're also very stupid.
We're genetically flawed and very stupid.
Maybe we have to follow.
No, that was a lot of fun.
Yeah, but this is...
I like Planetarium, too.
But it's something better about it.
Because this will show all the space station
sightings and everything.
There is a lot nicer to take your kids than the backyard.
There is a program.
Yeah, let's lighten what they look at.
Now I know that'll tell you.
There's a program.
It's called Salary.
Yeah.
So you can also say where you are.
And then actually you can...
depending on the month of the year,
actually you can see what Star Wars you had in Bawa
and they...
...hour in a day.
Okay.
You can see that, too.
Cool.
Well?
Well.
I didn't do too much.
No, I did something bad.
I tried to do this.
That looks technical.
It is technical.
Well, it's technical.
What do you do is that you take the fan.
You put a bag that...
The cool band didn't work, right?
It did well.
Well, I still...
It didn't turn.
Oh, it's going too fast.
The thing is that...
He stopped and you just cut the wires.
No.
Was it very stable?
Yeah, you have radio stand here.
Oh, cool.
But the thing is...
You put the magnet on the inside.
You put magnet on the inside.
It's like a chemistry thing.
So I bought...
It's called Stristic.
So I...
I have two Stristic.
Oh, you did?
No, it doesn't.
It's mostly done by humans.
Some of them they are.
But you wrote it one time.
It was a cheap one.
It was cheap one.
Because you want to have your ease in certain temperature range.
So that's why it's not heated.
But I have actually two inches of Stristic.
And one of them is so strong that I actually binds the fan.
And the fan doesn't move.
So the magnet is too strong.
The magnet is too strong.
What are you using for the Stristic?
Two-inch stick.
It's called Strbar.
But it's magnetic.
So you have magnet on the bottom.
You don't need a magnetic one.
If you've got that strong of a magnet, just put it in like a ball bearing.
You have to spin around there or a bowl or something.
Sure.
So what are you trying to do with this?
What do you do with this?
What do you do with this?
What do you do with this?
Yes.
What do you do with the magnetic oxygen?
You can at the oxygen because right now I'm just trying to grow the yeast.
Basically the idea of these things was that you could stir things in a sealed container.
In case it was going to give off something.
No.
I didn't want to be in the universe.
So you want to stir it in a sealed container as you wouldn't...
Can you sterilize it?
Yes.
So you want to introduce any...
Sure.
More so that it doesn't explode.
Sure.
Fix it with the oxygen.
Something's 10 to 10.
So that's what I was trying to do.
Cool.
At least not right.
And I like three different fans.
You know, I don't want to worry.
And the other one doesn't worry.
And I like three different far, far things.
And I'm trying to do that.
This is close.
I'm just getting one of those big winter fans.
There's those furry things.
Nice seeing you.
We're like a big long capsule.
Yes.
That's what it is.
And long.
You know what else you need?
You need the web page for fish or something.
Here you go.
So you can buy one that just works.
Yeah.
It's not fun.
You know.
So you have actually these.
Yes.
There you go.
And there are different sizes.
And I have two each size.
But I have one of them is actually flat.
And that one doesn't have this ring in the middle.
So that one doesn't want to move.
It binds the other fan.
The one which has a ring there.
Our shape is moving.
Oh, like you said.
It's a bit boring.
It is like a fish.
Yes.
And from time to time, actually the bar is thrown off.
It's kind of interesting, you know.
That's all we're done.
And you've got to be lucky that you've got a newsletter on Tuesday.
Because I was lucky because I didn't have to bother with it.
I ring something else someday.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how I guess you are all working there.
Yeah.
That's all what I've done.
I got that J-Track one here.
Oh, yeah.
J-Track.
That's the space junk.
Yeah, that's the space junk.
Oh, we've got more than that out there.
Well, that's the stuff they go about.
Yeah.
Shift clicks, zoom in, control clicks.
Yeah.
There we go.
And I think you can also...
So guys, can they censor it?
Ring right around the...
Equated here at...
Probably around the satellites.
Oh, yeah.
Right around the geosaccharis.
You want to show me how you're going to look south.
Which one?
Maybe in terms of the podium.
Generally, we're going south.
Only going north, south, north and north.
Oh, okay.
Wouldn't that different eventually fall down?
Some of them will be up there.
I think they're saying two to seven years.
It's probably GLC core.
So it depends on how much atmosphere it's coming to contact with.
How quickly your goal is going to be.
Is it gravity?
I mean, gravity?
Yeah.
Your heart is spinning.
It's just that.
I should let it spin.
Yeah.
I'm like 10 feet closer to one.
Oh, take a feet.
Yeah.
If gravity is willing, eventually everything has to go.
Sure.
It's gravity.
Eventually everything will go straight.
The magnetic fluid will go straight.
It will slow down eventually.
But the faster you do it, the faster you do it.
The faster you do it.
The faster you do it.
The faster you do it.
You know, it's counting the atmosphere.
But there's more atmosphere up there than the original focus, too.
There's absolutely nothing.
And it's also more uneven than this.
But then gravity is more.
There's more.
There's more.
Maybe it wasn't more than we were.
Maybe it wasn't more than that.
Because that was the satellite.
Maybe it's not just a straight-up atmosphere.
So maybe it's just redistributing it.
Maybe it's just redistributing it.
We're checking these.
Oh, not.
That's great.
Oh, it's just that.
Yeah, goes into satellites.
You guys are just too excited about it.
There's like three.
We have satellites.
Oh, okay.
There's a shitload of them up there.
Yeah.
I just, yeah, I got all these weird orbits of probably GPS, yep, yeah, I got
uh, installed the geo-sync.
Oh, that just excites about what I think.
It isn't even stuff stuff.
It's really hard to click on this stuff.
So you really think the stuff is over, here's Africa, so the stuff will rust
over there.
Right.
Oh, you can see right over us.
Yeah, look at it right here.
That's all junk.
Hey, that's pretty cool.
You know what I just like missed your shoot and found today.
What's the thing?
Well, vaporizing.
Well, just keep that distance.
I don't want to break that.
You don't want to break that distance.
Well, look at the one with this.
Like, it's obviously just used in a previous installation.
So you have a black residue for a electrical tape.
What is it?
It's all in four.
It's broken.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Do you think the molten board didn't work?
Actually, I did install the HPVB.
But it's four orders right here.
For the scale.
So I actually made a mirror.
Well, for me to play.
Well, I have to give you back the hops next spring.
Because we have we grow hops in our garden.
So I'm going to grab the flowers.
Yeah.
We've used them.
I heard they've grown up very good.
Really?
That's what people say.
We have a couple of dishes that use small amounts.
As a spice.
I don't know how they work.
They've been instant scenes.
How much do you actually use?
Well, it's pretty dry.
So if I get a battery, it's about one to one.
So it's like half as up.
Well, I guess it's pretty light.
Yeah, do you?
I've never noticed how much you was putting in my use of that.
So it is about a few minutes.
Command all the skate is, of course, put that in the box.
So we have like a manner of the skate.
It's down the baggy floor every year.
There'll be a link so I'll give you these.
These open.
Is that the first?
It's like the first couple of things.
It goes like that.
It's a whole lot of things.
Pursing all your floors and stuff.
They got some nice and fresh yellow floors.
So they got better floors.
Why do you guys grow it?
Because we have bigger floors.
So it is just for shade.
No.
It's for some murder scenes.
It's planted a little good.
Yeah, because it's not killing it.
So it's playing with me.
You know what?
I could find that out.
Yeah.
Probably.
Probably.
You know, I used to have the little, you know,
stick it in tape that came with it.
No, no, no, no.
You know, the garden water.
Okay.
And it said it's exactly the same.
So I probably can find that out.
It's actually there.
So you go under the monument on board?
Yes.
What's the cap in court?
Where is that?
You know, where the top of 93 is,
where it comes in where the old wall used to be.
It's 93 south of town.
Oh, I know.
Where there are bigger changes.
Well, if you go facing south,
if you turn right, just before you get on 93.
Okay.
Go over to one and right.
It's on the south end.
It's on the right.
Okay.
Bathroom.
Okay.
It's first house.
So that's where it is.
So there's this huge,
full board right here.
Yeah, there's this huge museum.
There's like a...
Are you writing the server form?
Where is he?
He runs it from...
He runs it from...
From his own home.
Thank you.
They were getting to making things like,
like honey water and stuff like that.
I don't know if they do anything like that.
Some people are doing needs.
Some people are doing vines.
Did they have something like that?
It sounds like Polish mud.
We have a drink called mud.
It's a honey wine.
I don't think I've heard of it.
Well, I think no.
Because mud is actually...
It's more like a wine.
Well, that could be a wine.
Mud is not a wine.
I thought maybe check it.
So something like that.
It's made of vine.
It's made of vine.
It's because honey is made of vine.
So it's made of vine.
Well, this is really interesting radio here.
What do we have there?
Oh, that is awesome.
Three different copies.
Are they worth having anything to do with this?
That's good.
They're not coordinating our records.
Okay.
Okay.
And trucks and wagons.
Just hope you don't...
He's talking about a wine.
Just hope you don't need a sled.
That's all.
Oh, that's all.
Yeah.
So this is me.
Did you just...
No, no.
That's okay.
Here's a thirsty monk.
That's okay.
Is that what you're going to name your dear thirsty monk?
That's what I thought.
That would be...
But as I said, I think it went off days here.
Happy New Year.
Don't have so much time.
There's thirsty monk or drunken monk.
That's not the same thing.
Anyway, the newsletter.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for the interest.
So, I saw PHPPV.
Did I see that?
Okay.
Let's move on.
Okay.
Well, there was the Linux Foundation acquired Linux.com.
I guess we were talking about the Linux.com.
I didn't know the Linux.com was owned by SourcePort.
And there...
It is...
These articles are...
Some of them are that they was acquired.
Some of them are, let's say, like, looking back at Linux.com.
People really don't know what happened.
Because SourcePort was profitable.
Linux.com had a lot of original content.
And people didn't see anything coming.
So, it's more...
Okay.
Yeah, I'm missing something here.
But I don't have anything there.
And then Google Summer of Code.
Is that?
And so, people can start signing up.
Not you. You have to use Google anymore.
Unless you go back to school and change.
I think there's probably an age restriction.
Registered for 8 bucks.
For 8 bucks.
And there was another suit.
Red had got sued for G-Boss.
And I think it was something about that...
It was...
With the storing data in a database.
It was some very...
Something very obvious.
It's like, okay.
Yeah, somebody bought that.
They decided that they wanted to make some money.
Yeah.
And then there was article about Mozilla.
And they were talking about new browser tabs.
There is a...
They were talking about new browser tabs.
There is already...
There is already...
Plug-in.
How do they call it?
It's a plug-in.
Yeah.
Do they call it plug-in?
Plug-in add-on extension.
So you can actually try it out right now.
And it's supposed to be...
I think already in 3.1.
You know, it's funny.
It is exactly what opera does.
Like, almost...
A lot of stuff...
A lot of stuff is actually made from opera.
So let's say the first staff thing was pretty much...
Yeah, opera.
I know. I just thought it was kind of fun.
Like, almost...
All they did was, instead of making it, you know,
look like 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, they just...
Put them on the side.
Maybe you have the same search partner.
Is there...
Is there a way?
Okay, just trust it.
Why are you running add-on with...
Make some work.
Is there a way?
Yeah.
It's not even worth that word.
It's not a staff.
It's really glitchy.
That's cool.
Safari has some pretty cool gestures built in for Mac too.
It's kind of interesting.
You know, there's...
There's other ones...
I mean, there's like two fingers scroll.
It can be operate.
But then there's some that are exclusive to Safari too.
There's different gestures like the pinch.
Like you can squeeze down.
Like when you're in a browser, the pinch will increase and decrease the font size.
And the middle finger gesture?
No.
Right.
And that works pretty good.
But yeah, it was operas really work well with Mac mouse.
Like, you can use any of those...
You know, Apple.
Or the Mac OS.
Right.
That's right.
Right.
Well, you have to consider the environment.
I mean, you know, if you've got a large trackpad, you know, you have that ability.
And I think there's something that makes it better for the actual hardware trackpad too.
There's something about the multitouch in the hardware itself that makes it better somehow.
I don't totally understand the technology.
But, you know, there's something about being able to take one, two, and now three.
And the different pads can detect different number of button presses.
Most pads now, except for, I think, the L pads can detect multiple key presses even on, like, standard, you know, intelligence.
Like, my pad will detect up for button presses during four touches.
And there's actually a setting in the synaptic.
In terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of, in terms of...
Most laptops.
Cool.
There was an article about what I like to Linux.
And there's the guy from the PC bag.
I don't know if you guys read it.
It's more editorial.
Yeah.
There's saying, finally, I discovered Linux.
But, interesting that he's talking about it.
And he has nice things to say about Linux.
All you want, you can't afford to buy Linux software.
No more dividends.
I mean, he's always a little bit controversial.
And that, you know, the statement, what he made was, let's say, the windows, I'm kind of tired and fed up with,
that it's accumulating more and more software and after some time, nothing is working and running.
It was interesting to see that.
What else do we have there?
Yes.
and has been sent.
And then there was some, I'll show you after a second.
There was article about XFC.
So somebody did write up about experience with a UXFC
and FFMPEG.
.5 was released.
I guess FFMPEG didn't have any changes for a long time.
Wow, that's a quite a cold word for FMPEG.
Yeah, it weighed the world domination.
Yeah, I was playing with the world domination.
FAKA, whatever, a belligerent blue white shirt.
Yeah, how about that?
For sure, is that going to a iteration?
Wow, I'm impressed.
Yeah, it's not halfway.
We got one state, Rhode Island for sure.
So there are actually two articles about it.
One was released. No, the other one was Don't call it it.
There was something about managing your audio files in Linux.
It was more water ver applications there.
So did somebody look at it?
Well, it looks interesting.
So read it.
Yeah, I think they will.
So it was more as a listing.
But what are the applications there if you want to do any audio?
I don't know.
Actually, it's moved.
It looks like the door.
It's really the door.
I can't hear it.
Well, isn't there our FFM file?
Yeah, I don't know.
It's particularly moving to the door.
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah, there's, you might have had to install an illusion.
Oh, well, that's what nonprofits is.
You know, it was modified your prepositories too.
Yeah, alternative prepositories are there for a lot of maps that are semi-free.
Yeah.
Yeah.
After into video files or the main repository,
and there's an illusion repository, I think.
With that, you know, when FFM is actually written in, well, in Pascal,
it's a Delphi.
Delphi clone of the, oh, Pascal.
Put it around, trying to say.
Only you know.
There is a Pascal.
It's started with the hell, which is actually clone of Delphi.
It's a mine.
Like a zaris or something like that.
That's a, that's a pinhole.
And there's a program that it's, you need to be there.
Delphi, yeah, there's open source clone of Delphi.
Yeah, I think it's called, like, Lazarus.
Lazarus is something like that.
Yeah.
It's always starting out from a program.
It has a program that, of course, programs know.
Yeah, probably.
I like such a thing.
It was cool.
Yeah.
It's actually used as an SQLite database in the back end of the search.
Cool.
Showing you a lot.
Well, I was searching for a fast, just, just, just, just from 47.
So it's up, down, down.
And then there was an article with something about US schools and, uh,
how they like, whatever the next day, whatever day.
Whatever day I do it.
Well, that's, I talked to a guy that he's the IT director for a school.
And I asked him, is it why you put links in?
Well, he goes, well, I don't know why.
I mean, they pay like five bucks for a license of Windows.
Well, they, they pay for massive site licenses, which is publicly funded by the government.
And so, I mean, really, I think the biggest photo is the mindset of people that are in the highest levels of the industry.
Because, I mean, they, they don't really see the value of moving something like that,
because they're publicly funded, so they're going to get going.
They also don't study advantage to teaching kids about this, because they,
as far as the teachers are concerned.
Yeah, it costs so much money.
It's going to help us because they have to train everyone.
And the fact that they're able to function or able to buy it,
there's a beer, there's no one else going to use it anymore.
Yeah.
But, you know, what is interesting, you had the Mac lives, you know?
Yeah.
School used to be a very Mac centric.
Yeah, Macs.
We're nothing but Macs in schools before.
Yeah.
And it is.
I think it has a lot to do with the deals that they give to schools.
Yeah, the Macs.
They give a lot of that stuff for basically free.
They really don't pay for Windows.
And the hardware is...
Who's church?
Well, with 70s and early 80s.
Apple is giving updates to schools.
I don't remember that.
So that's why there was going to happen.
Because if you start the kids off using Windows, that's what they're going to be comfortable with.
Well, I think that's a basic bonus.
That'd be like, that's like saying the kids are so stupid, they don't know how to learn.
Yeah.
Well, I think it's a Mac.
The teachers are more...
Yeah, it's the teachers who are not as stupid as I think.
There's some extra stuff in my sauce and I tell you why.
Yeah, and bedded in them into like the higher music.
They don't even have anything.
They don't even have anything to do with the stuff.
Well, that would be...
Yeah.
That would be the next generation of people.
But somehow, they put the sticks through the heart of Apple.
Because Apple was there.
I used Mac to do...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
And that's something new with the money.
Because Apple would not negotiate with the prices.
They want to do what?
I mean, I was in the high school obviously when I transitioned over to Windows, but I don't know.
When would that have happened?
Pretty much for you.
Well, it probably took a turn to cheat.
Yeah.
The PCs were cheap, right?
Compared to some pair of the apples.
And the other licensees are also...
I mean, I remember running CAD on Apple.
Apple.
No, high school.
No, high school.
I think...
You Microsoft is not your excellent job of marketing the product.
Well, yeah.
The product that's great, it's just for marketing is phenomenal.
If you are going to a best marketing company, did you see the new Microsoft had something about a lot of data moving around?
It doesn't make a sense.
Oh, yeah.
What?
Yeah.
You don't know it's something, man.
Yeah, you got to talk and...
What's going on?
Yeah.
Did you know what it was commercial for?
Tell us about Microsoft.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Remember mine.
Let's move on.
Well, there was article...
I didn't think that at school said that it bothers me because even though it's $5 or whatever...
It's still $5.
And Linux is true.
That's...
To me, if you were begging for money and you keep having to go a year after year to reference,
$5 is $5.
Cut it all out and...
You know, to...
Ah!
That's simple.
Pretty good.
You gotta go off to any levels.
It's...
Yeah, I think it boils down to the administration.
It boils down to the...
The mentality...
The people who grew up with this...
The people like the higher ups of like the state boards of education in Wisconsin and every other state.
They're incredibly technological.
I mean, I just think about...
I've been following some of the stories about how like Obama's like one of the first like...
We've been semi-technologically savvy presidents.
And I think once you reach a certain level of administration,
whether it's in education or whether it's in politics or something like that,
there's just a massive naivety about everyone at that level.
They just don't have a clue about what's going on.
And 20 years behind.
I also, you know,
support and maintenance people in the institution.
You know, like the university,
they would do a co-operative program
in the 90s.
You know, just because...
I graduated from 2000.
There was still a co-operative program in...
In a great form.
You know, the university administration wouldn't go over to...
The statewide system,
it was based on co-operating
and the people who were doing the maintenance locally convinced them
that the world would fall apart
and no one would do anything at the places.
Well, let's move on.
There is a rule article about our system.
I guess we were talking about it at the beginning.
Yeah, I just kind of worked on it.
There is...
It's been still there.
And not...
How is it the same article?
Twenty-seven music making apps for Linux?
Or is this actually...
No, it's a different thing.
It's about more about audio creation.
As well as, yeah.
It's not just recording,
but there is...
Let's say like hydrogen, then...
You know, the drum and machine and stuff like that.
There's a lot of these I haven't heard of.
See?
Read it.
I will.
Read it, then it?
I will.
I will.
Do it.
Write it out.
I am.
So...
Yeah.
As well as at the end, I saw that there was...
Of course, it's a movie.
A movie?
Yeah.
All right.
It's a Linux shooting loop.
Yeah, it's called a movie.
Yeah.
So...
A lot of them there.
Yeah.
Usually I don't like articles,
which they list now that I'm up front.
Right now we have three different things.
So there was something about...
I just wrote back to OpenSews for the where I live in Preview
and Ubuntu.
I know for Preview.
So if somebody read it.
You know, it's funny about OpenSews that discontinuing me.
I put it in a laptop that works.
And it goes and it installs.
And then it goes, it's going to reboot and it reboots.
And then it must forget to install the STALE AT8 drivers
because they even can't find the hardware at boot from it.
Because their install process is actually two-way process.
They install BASE and then they reboot at BASE STALE.
Anything on top of it?
Yeah.
And it must not be finding the STALE AT8.
So I just...
Yeah.
Which one?
These OpenSews?
I thought that they would have STALE AT8 hardware.
Drivers built in.
But obviously they're either forgot about it.
I had it on the STALE in my area.
It was a laptop.
So I don't know.
I don't know.
All I know is that it went through and installed.
And I'll send the reboots.
Can't find it.
It's having a video motherboard.
You know, you can tell about that.
You can tell about that.
I had the same experience with the Dream Linux.
I couldn't...
I can never just start Dream Linux.
There are people who are installing it.
But I cannot get through the partitioner.
And I don't know what it brought from.
It's pretty on the pictures.
It actually in a VM.
Maybe on a...
On a...
What would it be?
It's like for a while.
It's pretty...
It's an open screen.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
But once you realize you're going to have to...
Pretty this goes over here.
There's some article about QT.
4.5 was released.
And then there was something about Nokia.
Or wherever it stands in there.
And then this was interesting.
There was QT for tutorial.
And there was video.
And...
Yeah.
QT.
It's a toolkit.
It's a toolkit.
It's just a toolkit for KVU faces.
So...
It was actually...
But it was quite interesting.
Is there any good screencasting programs?
Other things?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The more you have to record, the more this stuff would be.
Why?
Because I review.
I think...
I think if you would search on our...
I get...
...set it up with...
Which one could it be?
If you would search on our website,
would find more. There is some like capture for Lennox or something. There was another one, so
and what else. So there was actually video about it. Actually that article is being unrelated. I
don't think it's related at all, but it's for beginners and it reminded me a little bit of Delphine
because you got yourself a toolkit and you were just writing a code. The method is what you
wanted to write. So it provided you any myth graphically, any boxes or any boxes or anything
like that. You need to write a code. You have a widget. It does a lot of code for you and kind of
create stocks and then you can fill in the stock. So it has a function. When you click on this
button, you'll want this function. So then you have to fill in the function.
What is this? This is all C. I think that actually you can have different bindings. It means that
you can write different calls, it's C++, but you can have bindings to go to other languages too.
So if you want to do it in Python, yeah. So I think what do you have that? So you have a canvas
and you put us like buttons on canvas. So you put the boxes on canvas.
Like that on front page. You can move the stuff around here, right?
Yeah, using wrong dictionary right now, but yes. Front page is on a web development.
This is for blind people. It's a similar.
All right, let's move on. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for all. All islands.
What else do we have there? There is that the the said what are you talking about? Hydra oxygen.
Thank you. And there was some evil make it pretty with the Gutenberg, whatever it was that.
It was more out to it. And last week there was a gentleman he was talking, he was your first time.
So here is something about file dictionaries. That goes back to our time session earlier is that
that been your truth. I'm sure that probably listen. I'm sure it's there. When you get home,
you click on the link and read about it. There was an article how we convert the convert
VMware image to virtual box today. And then I didn't know that. So you can just open it.
So that's a good feature. Is it tight? You have a big group. They have a really good manual,
but they don't have a lot of energy. The features will then be used in basically that group.
And for your manual? Yeah. But the whole part is actually a piece of manual.
And then we have another one about VMware and sound art with a post audio.
I have no idea. I wasn't paying attention.
I created private encrypted folder because you really care.
This is how the run successful Linux user group. And I didn't read that either.
Did you write it? No. Are you running successful?
The user group? Yeah. I think so. Okay. We'll just click on it so you can
hit the tips they got. What's the number one thing? Yeah. Let's read that and see how you're
doing. Stay in a point. Have the person bring the burners. It's a long article, you know?
Is that the first step is to go to ganglion? I think you're right. But this might be just the head there.
I think the bar is about, yeah, I think this is about an image.
I think it's emotional for the indigenous people. Because you couldn't get drinks and stuff.
It doesn't go to the vending machine. Do you guys stay attention?
Yes, yes, no. Yeah, no, I'm about 3K. No, we're talking about Linux.
No, no, somebody said something.
I see. Do you want to tell us about Qt? No. For an hour and Gtk.
Yeah, we're going to do that now. Okay. How thank you. I read how it runs successful.
Why? So how do you run it? How are you supposed to improve?
No, I actually read all the stuff we can do.
Okay. I don't know if I can read it.
Actually, yeah, a lot of the stuff they are doing. They say they have a good meeting place that
actually they say beer is probably detrimental to your
have IRC. They have very bitter people to make ugly comments after two more years.
Yeah, there's websites, content, you know what I've done.
Chair starts like, no, it was better than Katie.
For those who know, take the eye, smack email.
I think we have done with the recording. What do you think?
Okay, I'll get no, I'll get no. Take, take us out please. Bye.
No, thank you. I like you normally do it. Much nicer normally.
Okay, then this is your first time.
Bye.
Well, we say we're done. See you next week. Thanks, Melissa.
Thank you for listening to Haftler Public Radio.
