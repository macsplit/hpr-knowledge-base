We will have a recording going on the HPR Mumble server for anyone to come on and say happy New Year and talk about whatever they want.
We will leave the recording going until January 1st, 2019 12am UTC that will be 7am Eastern Standard Time or until the conversation stops.
Please visit hackerpublicradio.org to find all the details and links about how to set up the PC Mumble client, your favorite mobile app, the mobile server connection details.
Our Etherpad show notes and the live audio stream if you only prefer to listen in on the lively banter.
So please stop and say hi and maybe join in the conversation with other HPR listeners and contributors. It's always a good time.
I'm one you're listening to hacker public radio. This is clap 2 and I'm going to talk about Scribus today. Scribus is a page layout application.
You are in theory a person sitting at a desk in a big publishing house and every day you get text files and you get graphic files in your inbox.
Someone comes along and says hey we need you to take all of those text files and those graphic files and put them together on a page.
And you think well why do you need a whole person to do that? Like that doesn't seem like that big of a deal. Surely you could just open up Libra Office and put the text in and then drop the graphics in and then send it to your printer and you'd be done.
And to some degree you'd be correct. That is definitely an option. You can open up a word processor and do all kinds of page layout in that word processor.
And you may or may not end up with something that looks very pleasing and something that's printable, something that you can publish and no one would know the difference possibly.
Quite possibly. Once it's been printed on a page and sent to people or printed to a PDF and posted online, people don't know what the heck you used to generate that document.
It just doesn't matter in the end as long as it looks pleasing to the eye and conveys the information or emotion that you're trying to evoke.
That said, there are cases where you want a little bit more power over some very, very fine details. And that's the kind of stuff that you would be looking to scribus for when you realize that your needs have gone beyond basic drag and drop.
Put your image here, give it some text wrap so it's not overlapping the text and and and that sort of functionality that's provided by by a word processor or by really, really basic excess L with from your docker book sources or whatever whatever you might be doing.
So, scribus is handy for this and a lot of people have expressed confusion about scribus just not even confusion but just mystification. They don't know how to begin with scribus. It just seems overwhelming, over complex and confusing and ultimately they just don't use it.
So, what I want to do is do a walkthrough of scribus and I know that it's audio only so you might think well that doesn't make a hundred percent sense to do an audio only walkthrough of a very visual application.
But I think that hearing about the workflow is just as powerful as seeing it to be honest because it's not it's realistically I don't think you would need to sit down and follow through a walkthrough of it click by click.
I just I'm more interested I'm less interested in telling you where buttons are or even where many locations are and more interested in talking about the workflow behind sitting down and doing a page layout because that's the part that that I think people just don't quite understand.
And if the description of the workflow doesn't make sense to you then scribus might not be the application you think you should it might not be the application you should be using even though you think that might that that it makes sense to to use it.
But it might be overkill for you or it might just not mesh with the way that you think about laying information out and that's fine.
So the first screen so scribus first of all is its cross platform it's it's pretty easy to install on pretty much anything as far as I can tell certainly on Linux.
It's very easy and BSD it's very easy and from what I see on web pages and things it seems pretty easy for windows and Mac as well.
So you can you should be able to use scribus no matter what when you launch scribus you are brought to a new document window and this is.
It seems fairly self explanatory but there are a couple of things that you should probably be aware of.
So it's it's asking you what size page you want to design for that's that's its purpose is to do page layout so it needs to know what the page is going to be.
You can choose a couple of different options you can do a single page a double sided page threefold or a four fourfold those are the templates that are included with scribus.
I'm going to stick with single page but I'll just kind of note that the double the double sided layout is really useful if you're designing something that you know is going to be open physically like a book.
I have a feeling that most people read like if you're designing for a PDF for something that you know it's going to be primarily distributed digitally.
I have a feeling most people read those one up I could be wrong but that's just kind of my sense.
Whereas double sided pages or double sided layout assumes that you're going that you are designing for something that you're going to print and that people are going to open there's a binding and that way you can you can design across two pages to open pages.
Now you might be thinking well how does the printer get all the pages correct because surely surely it would be confusing to know whether the right page is going to be on the you know the left page is going to be on the front or the back of the left or if it's you know so where's the fold essentially well double sided takes care of that for you because it will ask you whether to have the first page on the right hand side of the screen or the left hand side of the screen.
Now if it's on the left side of the screen then you have to assume that it's a piece of paper that you receive that you get and you're looking at it and that's it left and right.
So screen left and screen right is exactly what you see if you're holding a piece of paper.
But if the first page is on the right side now you're folding the page in half and you're looking at essentially the the back side of the page because it's been turned it's been folded and it's facing you.
And then if you open that now you see the left and the right screen left screen right and then if you close it again then you see the backside of the page again.
So kind of it can be confusing but just know that the software is tracking all of that stuff for you so don't overthink it too much the defaults are really good.
So if you're doing a page layout for physical media for a magazine or a scene or a book that you want to have people flipping through pages and seeing exactly what you saw when you were designing it then that would be double-sided with the first page on the right.
Also important is the size and the orientation so size I'm setting it to A4 if you're in the U.S. you can do U.S. letter I think somewhere in there but A4 is what I use in New Zealand orientations portrait or landscape so portrait being sort of long side you know taller than it is wide landscape being wider than it is tall.
And then there's other again I think self-explanatory things like number of pages you want four pages you want one page.
I'm going to do a single page with one page and you can do the default unit so whatever you think in is what you can set this to I'm going to put it in centimeters and then there's also a setup or an option rather for an automatic text frame which I'll get into why I don't do this but you can have it generate text frames on every page for you so it will act like a word processor meaning that every page that you get you can start typing in and text will appear.
Believe it or not that's not the default for scribes and believe it or not it's generally not something that I activate I don't think I've ever used automatic text frames.
But if you are really into scribes and you want to use it for as a word processor first of all you shouldn't but you could then you might want to have automatic text frame or if you just know that you've got pages and pages and pages a text then maybe it makes sense to have automatic text frames on.
But I'll go into into that more momentarily and then maybe you'll get a sense for why that's an option it tends to surprise people so anyway I've set my default unit to centimeters now I'm going to talk about another confusing thing which is margins and bleeds so margins is margins I guess is let's call it a fake concept margins like there's no margin is just parts of the page that you've agreed not to use.
That's all a margin is right so if you're designing something and and you want to make sure that there's room on the edge of the page then you need to set a margin or you you would want to set a margin and you can do that with margin guides and all that does is it draws it draws a blue line for you to indicate.
Hey your margin starts here so anything you know from the center of the page anything outside of this blue line is margin space you can put stuff in there if you want but you told me you didn't want to put stuff out there so that's all the margin does and I can see here that it's set by default apparently to 1.4111 centimeters so I'll just leave it at that that's all around now bleeds is a little bit that that gets a little bit more confusing I think for most people so a bleed.
Is extra paper on the sides of your paper so it is if you look at a piece of paper there is no bleed there there is the bleed is invisible there is no that you go off the edge of the page and then you fall into empty space that's the bleed area so on your in your software you can keep it at zero you can have zero bleed
and you'll know that what you're looking at on your screen represents the exact size of your page or the exact bound boundaries of your of the physical page that you're going to eventually print this stuff on but if you want and sometimes printers professional printers demand this they require this they sometimes want you to include a bleed area and the bleed area is so that they can print on their big fancy professional printers.
A little bit off the sides of the page and then when they cut those pages down to size they are 100% guaranteed they're very very sure that there will be no little minuscule white border where the printer just decided that that was the end of the page so bleeding is basically there printing more than they need farther out than they need to in order for them to trim the pages down to the correct size
and ensure that that all the all the ink goes to the very very edge of the page that's what a bleed is so if you for instance add a bleed a one centimeter bleed to your a four page instead of a 210 centimeter millimeter page you're going to have a looks like it's a from a negative one centimeter to 22 centimeters which of course is not represented.
So you're going to have a negative of an a four page that an a four page should go should go from zero centimeters to 21 centimeters so that's what bleed is it adds extra space around your page so that you can put graphics a little bit outside of the page boundary so that your printer is able to print exactly the amounts of ink you know make sure that all the ink that you want to go to the edge of the page gets to the very very edge of the page.
One might even call it the bleeding edge of the page okay so that's what margins and bleeds is so margins are denoted by blue a blue box and bleed is denoted by red if you don't use a bleed which is pretty common I don't always use a bleed it kind of depends on the use case and the printer's demands then then the edge then the edge of your page on screen you you might detect a little bit of a red box around it and that's that's why because that's that's the bleed area okay so once you've done that once you've gone through those steps.
And configured your your documents that becomes what's called a master page and the master page is just it's the template it is the it is the kind of page that whenever that that if you tell
to create if you if you realized after designing one page you realized oh I needed front and back of this page so I need another I need another square on my screen so I can or rectangles on my screen so I can so I can design the other
side of this page well you didn't you didn't ask Scribus for two pages you asked Scribus for one page so now what well what you do now is you can add a page
to your to your to your overall layout and the way that you would do that is you'd go to page insert and then it will ask you where you want
it to insert a page and so I would say okay I want one page at the end of my document now I could make it before the
page after the page or at the end so I'll just go at end before current page after current page or end and the master
page is normal because that's the only page that we've defined as the master page move objects with their page doesn't really matter because it's
going at the end and then it it it depends another page for me to to do layout on underneath the current page so you then you got a
two page document instead of just a one doc one page document so Scribus is very much again not a word processor it doesn't do
things that you would normally think a word processor would do such as give you an endless supply of paper it doesn't assume that you
want that it assumes that you want a very specific number of pages and that you have told it that specific page
page number and the reason again for this is because it's assuming you're going to go out to print and and if you've
created for a 300 page book then the last thing you want to do is accidentally design to 301 pages or 304 or
340 and not realize that you've gone over your apartment whereas if you have exactly 300 pages in Scribus then that's
that that you know when you've hit the end of your of your of your document so when you're deciding to design
something whether it's a flyer or a booklet a booklet for like a technical conference if you're on the staff of a
technical conference maybe you're doing the the program guide or maybe you're just doing a book design or
something or a game at manual who knows what you're doing you probably at least have text and you probably
have graphics and if you've got either only graphics or you've got only text then you probably
honestly don't need to be in Scribus you're this is probably overkill but the idea in Scribus is that you've
got this board that represents your page and it's up to you to fill it with stuff and these things that
you're going to fill it with are going to be constrained to to to boxes to to almost divs if you think of it in
HTML terms so there are two kinds of two primary types of objects that you can create or areas that you can
create inscribus and that's text and graphics and you get those with with little buttons at the top of
Scribus there's a toolbar up at the top and there's a there's a text insert text frame or insert
image frame so I'll do text first and again the blue lines being the boundaries for the margins I might
make a text box sort of right up against the blue line and maybe it takes up the top half of the
page or maybe you know what maybe it takes up the bottom half of the page so I'll just kind of
approximately draw this frame within the bottom portion of the page within the margin areas
and that'll be that and it's just a big box now to type text in there if you don't have any
text you can just double click and then you get a text entry marquee and you can enter text I think
more often what what Scribus really expects you to do and I think what a lot of users actually
do is that they insert text into that frame and you insert it from presumably a text file that you're
or that your copy editor has sent to you so to do that you just hit control i for insert
and that's something that you'll that I literally don't even know I guess you could probably
right click yeah right click and then get text but no one I feel like that doesn't really
happen all that often you just do control i for insert and that's an old keyboard shortcut
carried over from the days of cork express look that one up if you're if you're curious so you can you
can insert a bunch of text from whatever source you happen to have lying around here's something
and then you got text in the text box and that's that's what normally people are doing because
they're expecting to be sent text I mean like in real life you're sent text from your copy editor
or you know I say copy editor just whoever earlier in the pipeline then you is responsible for
generating the text the you are responsible for putting on to the page now let's say that we want
to put an image into our document and the way that you would do that of course is you'd click
on the insert image frame button and you would draw an image frame somewhere on the page now I'm
going to do this to take advantage of my bleed area because that's what really any printer
would expect so I'll I'll just draw a box from the very very top of the page way beyond the
red border down about halfway and again it's going to expand across across past the other past
the opposite side of the of the red box so it's it's one centimeter taller and two centimeters
wider than really the page area has to offer but that's okay that's what the bleed area is for
but it's it's important to remember obviously that that means one centimeter of this
image is going to be cut off the top and two centimeters are going to be cut off the sides.
Okay so right now I've got an empty image frame it's just this frame is empty frame with nothing
in it it tells me that it's an image it's got a big X across it so it's an image
frame but I don't know there's there's no image there yet so all we've done is we've
created a placeholder or or really a a a bounding box so we will right click and
get image or just do what everyone else does in control I and I'm going to grab a really
really big image and the reason I'm doing a really really big image is because I
want to have to adjust it so if I'm if I bring this big image in and I'll I'll you'll
probably notice a couple of things right away first you might notice that the quality
of the image just doesn't seem quite what you think it ought to be so you should know
that strivis doesn't use full quality images on purpose it downreses things so that it can
display large documents easier for you and all of the all of the layout programs have
this option because the the more images you have all over the place just the
the slower and slower the application is obviously going to be able to respond
and that gets really really annoying especially when you are just a layout
artist you don't even have to worry about what the images look like that's been
taken care of previously in the pipeline all you need to know is that this is the
general sense of the image here's where it goes and and that's fine you'll you'll
you'll trust that the full quality is is good and of course when you send it to
PDF and send it out to the printer it's going to be using the full quality
image it's only downresing it for internal use so do not worry about quality it
it's not showing you what you're actually going to see in terms of quality but
in layout it's being very precise so that's the first thing to know now the second
thing to know is that well this image is really really big and at least for
me it's it's bigger than the frame that it's bigger than it's than the image
frame that that it it has been put into so I'm seeing a sliver of this image
really at the top left corner of the image is what I'm seeing so there's a
couple of different ways and I guess it's kind of it's best to to mess around
but this and get used to it I'm again pretty used to it so it's pretty natural
for me but it might be strange to people who aren't used to this but certainly
think of the image frame as a little window and and the image that you have
placed into it is underneath that window so you can
double click on the image frame with an image in it and then you can start
click it clicking and dragging and you can see that you can move the image
around within its frame so if you just want maybe you actually only want
some small portion of the image to be visible maybe that's exactly what you
had intended if that's the case then you're you're good you can move and
focus in on the the one small section of the image that you wanted to focus in
on and then click outside of it and you've locked it into place and now
that's that's the image that you have that's fine now maybe that's not
what you want though so there are a couple of different options to resize
this image so that you're seeing what you actually intend what you actually
intended to see so the first the first way to do it I guess the most direct way
would be in properties and if you don't see a properties floating window
anywhere then you go to windows go to the windows menu
and select properties it's also the F2 keyboard shortcut that brings up
properties and there's a bunch of different tabs in property in properties
there's xyz there's shape group text image line and colors and in this case if
as long as you have the image that you are seeking to manipulate highlighted
or selected rather then the image tab is active you can click on that and
you'll notice that you've got a couple of different couple of different boxes
in there one is the x position one is the y position one is the x scale y scale
and actual dpi so the actual dpi should be you know 300 or so at least right
if it's not that means that well first of all you can adjust it you could say
okay well I really want this to be 300 dpi because I know that printing is going
to at least want it to be 300 for full quality so you can set that there
and that will reduce the image or it'll tighten the image if you will
and that means that you can see more of the images you're sort of you're almost
zooming out of the image or you're compressing those pixels so that might be
the problem right there now if it disappears completely then just look at the
x position and y position probably the x position and y position that you want
is more like zero centimeters rather than you know negative 20 or whatever
it might have had it might have changed to when you altered the dpi of the
image there's also a scaling the x scale and the y scale so you could adjust
those values as well and they may be they may or may not be locked together so
you might have to change them separately and you can click the lock to make them
change together so so that's that's another way to manipulate the size of the
image and then if if any of this sort of sets it off of what you want it to be
then you can double click again and kind of move it around or obviously you can
change the x position and y position with numbers if that's the way you want
to do it so that's that's kind of the most direct way to do it now I might as
well talk about the some of the other options because it it's useful to know
about the way it's it's good to practice anyway so I'm going to right click
and I'm going to do adjust frame to image and that does exactly what it sounds
like it's going to do it it adjusts the entire text frame so that it fits
around the image which might mean certainly in my case that the image is now
covering the entire page which is probably not what you want so that's one
that's one option adjust frame to image now the other option is to adjust
image to frame so if you if you take your frame back down sort of shrink it
back down to whatever you want or to some some some other space than the entire
page then or or some some size other than the entire image and then adjust
image to frame then it shrinks the image so that it fits in the frame now
again that might not be what you want because maybe your image is really big
your frames not so big you want the image all you want is like the top half
of the image or something like that and that's that's fine you can always you
can adjust that there are two different modes for an image frame one
and these are both again found in the in the properties in the image
properties so one is the scale to frame size which makes it so that whatever
you adjust your frame to if the image needs to scale at all in order to keep
within the bounds of the if the image frame then it does and that may be
exactly what you want and and for certain images it probably often is like
like for those kind of pop out images that that appear alongside of text like in
the margins or something that that's probably what you want to have happened
but if it's a big header image or or something that's going to take up much
of the page then maybe you want exactly the sliver of that image that you need
for that purpose and and so it's the frame that's more important to you in
which case what you want is the is a free scaling which again is the option
there in the image properties and that means that you can scale the image
frame to whatever in whatever dimension that you want and it'll just sort of
kind of crop the image without resizing anything it resizes the frame not the
image so that that again is free scaling for resizing the frame and not the
image or scale to frame size to scale the image along with anything that you
do to the frame and then in those modes or in the in the free scaling mode you
can adjust the specifics of the image by manipulating the numbers associated
with them like the DPI or the scale factor or the position of the image
whatever it is directly in the properties image panel so those are the two
things really I think that confused most people about scribes right there is
just how to get text on the page and how to get graphics on the page and
and that's how you do it you draw the frame and then you import the
content draw the frame import the content okay so a couple well okay so first I
I'll address some people don't like all of the meta data around page layout
they don't want to necessarily see or at least they don't want to see all the
frame all the boxes and the the outlines and the bounding boxes and the guides
and so on so if you if you're distracted by the faint you know the little red
line showing you where the bleed is and the gray line showing you where your
text box ends and so on then you can turn that off momentarily in preview
mode so if you go to view and then select preview mode you lose all of that
stuff and and it looks more or less like how it's going to look when it comes
off the the press out of the printer so that's that's a useful thing I don't
actually use that but it's it's something that I know some people say that
they just can't see around all of the all of the segmentation that kind of
follows when you're looking at the the document as a layout document so that
that might be useful to some people and it sometimes it is you know I mean
it can be useful because sometimes if you see where the you get a false sense
of where things end and begin because you see maybe you see the you see the
text frame ending at one point you think okay well that's pretty good that that
seems like the appropriate amount of white space from the bottom of that
text to the top of the next text but what you're really judging off of are
the the outlines of the bounding boxes and then you see it printed or you
know you see it in a preview and you think oh my gosh that's that's actually
a lot farther away than I realized and it was because you were judging the
distance off of not the text so sometimes it is useful to see it in preview
mode okay so that's preview mode the other thing that I wanted to address was
colors so scribus one of the one of the the advantages for the professional
print printing person is that scribus does work in CMYK space and you'll hear
that complaint a lot about gimp and other things and well really just gimp
people say oh I can't use that it doesn't use and it doesn't work in CMYK
well that's stupid that's not a real concern but for some people they say it
is and that's that's cool but scribus works in CMYK and so when you're in
scribus you're going to notice certainly that it has like if you're if
you're if you're drawing a box to highlight something or like a breakout
box that you want in sort of color in the background where where text is
over it or something like that you'll or if you're just coloring text for that
matter you're going to notice that in the colors property in the in the
properties of in the properties pane in the colors tab there are all of
let's see two four six eight ten maybe eleven colors available to you
there's like black cyan green magenta red white and yellow and maybe a couple
of different couple of variations on on what kind of black it is cool black warm
black rich black registration so that is a little bit confusing to a lot of
people why are there only like eleven colors that doesn't make any sense well
it makes sense because it's CMYK space in order for you to to get
scribus to to manage your colors properly you need to be in charge of
them you need to know what colors are possible so to do that you can go to the
edit menu and go down to colors and you get a pop-up box here by
like box called colors you can import colors and that's really great if you
have a bunch of color swatches that you want to import into this space which
is not not uncommon in publishing there might be a color scheme that someone
has developed you know as legal colors for that document so you can import
that if that doesn't exist then you can do a new color and name the color
something I'm going to call this link blue because I'm going to use it as the
color for my web web links like hyper hyperlinks color model yep we'll keep it
and CMYK and then we'll select kind of a blue that's not too offensive kind of a
vaguely earth Tony blue and then I'll click OK and now in my colors I have a
new a new color at the bottom of the list called link blue now if I go up to
my text properties oops I go up to my text properties then I can select any
hyperlinks that I have in this document and click on the colors and the color
and effects drop down in my text properties and for the little bucket here I'm
going to fill this text in with link blue and now it is an appealing
earth Tony blue to set it apart sort of from the from the black text but it's
not overly blue so as to be offensive that's pretty good I think so that's
that's colors and that's something that again tends to confuse people because
they think that that that any other program obviously would just give you a
pop up the colors picker and you could just choose whatever color you want
whatever you want to use that color but for ascribe as you are expected to
manage your colors a little bit more carefully because they actually mean
something to to the printer I think I'll probably finish it there really
that's that's the basics I mean there's there are there is a heck of a lot
more to learn but a lot of it is in the properties the properties panel
text wrap if if you've got an image that you want to plop down into the
middle of something just you'll you'll you'll discover all the different text
wrapping possibilities in the shape panel in the properties window.
Oh actually one more thing I should I should mention because this is a this
is a this is an unusual concept to most people so when you're doing a
multi-page document inscribes so I guess I'll just well I don't even have to do it
actually so if you're if you have more than one text box let's say you've you've
made one text frame on the left side of the page and then one on the right
side of the page so you're maybe doing a two column kind of setup but your
text does not fit into one frame so you want the frames to be connected you
want the text to flow from one flame into the other that's an easy fix or
that's an easy thing to set up it's just people don't usually have to do that
in a text in a word processor so they don't really know how to do it in and
scribes so the way that you're doing it is you select one text frame and then
you click click one text frame and then you click the button at the top of
scribes called link text frames and then you click the other frame that you want
to link it to and then if if the text if you keep typing into one text box and it
overflows the frame it'll start appearing at the top of the next frame now to
unlinked to linked text frames it's basically the same process except the other
box which is unlinked text frames so you click one of the linked frames then you
click the unlinked text frame or yeah unlinked text frame button and then click
the one that it was linked to that you no longer wanted to be linked to and you
tell that something is not linked anymore or or or you can tell that text is
overflowing because there's a little red box with an X in it at the bottom just
the bottom corner of the text frame so if you ever see that you'll know oh there's
text overflowing its frame I either need to make that frame larger or I need to
come up with another text frame someplace so that that text has a place to go
that happens fairly frequently with me because I'm usually when I'm using
Stribus I'm usually doing like an 8 or a 12 page document so it's I still
don't use that automatic text frame thing when I'm creating my new document
because I just don't believe in it so usually what I'll do is I'll draw my first
text frame I'll import my content and then I'll go to the next page a figure
out where the next frame wants to be and then I'll put that in there so that's
kind of that's something that I do frequently and you get warnings about all of this
stuff like everything when you go to export file export save as PDF now you
don't have to export as PDF it is the common output for pre-press documents if
you're going to a if you're going to send your thing to some professional printer
for mass reproduction then PDF is the way to go and you can do that by export
save as PDF now if if for some reason the thing that you're delivering to
wants something else you can do that to there's a save as image save as SVG
save as EPS save as text in some cases so I'm just going to save as PDF here
and you have lots and lots of different options and again kind of knowing what
your printer wants is important because some printers will tell you oh just send
us you know send us a folder of all your pages and we will arrange them in the way
that we need them to be arranged for our printer it's called a printer spread and
it doesn't print from one to eight or whatever let's say it's an eight page document
it wouldn't go one two three four five six seven eight it would go assuming that
it's being folded it would be one one and then eight two seven and then three
six I guess and then four and five yeah that's correct so they print it in a
different order so if your printer needs that then maybe maybe they're fine
with you just sending all the pages to them and they'll they'll print them in the
order that they need or maybe they expect you to do that yourself there's
there's a couple of different ways to do it PDF jam is a great application to help
you with that fonts you need to embed fonts usually because your printer doesn't
necessarily have the fonts that you that you have on your computer so you'd want to
embed all of your fonts color intended for printer yeah we need to do that
convert spot colors to process colors yes we need to do that use custom
render settings and no that's fine okay so yeah there's lots of different
options and communicating with your with a printer that you're sending it to is
usually helpful but the good thing about this whole process is that it it does
warn you when something's off like if text is overflowing and you know you didn't
fix it it'll tell you if an image is not optimally sized it will warn you so
not everything that it warns you about is fatal some things are truly just
warnings but it usually helps to read and see what it's telling you to make sure
that you're not about to to send something that is going to disappoint you when
you get it back from the printer and that's scribes hopefully this has not
necessarily taught you scribes but at least has told you or explained to you how
how the process goes how this workflow is typically implemented and it kind of
maybe demystifies some of the process for you the sample a sample of this
document is available and I will put the link in the show notes it'll be
somewhere on slackermedia.info which is my multimedia tutorial site so you
can download the scribes file and the resulting pdf and take a look at both
and discover a little bit about how the program works if you're if you're
curious thanks for listening I'll talk to you next time
