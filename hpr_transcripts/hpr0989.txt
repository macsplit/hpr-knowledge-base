This is Juiced Penguin, and I am your host, Dickie Lipschitz.
I'm just taking a break from getting my ass kicked from this early spring.
Little too much too soon.
Anybody else feel the same way? Well, what you can do is open a cold drink,
pull out a chair, and stick them headphones in your ears, and listen to one of these.
The other ones are longer and longer and longer.
There are more dreaming.
Today I'll make you a pure tank.
I'll pour it down until I'm from the section down below.
The last one we'll be able to find some kind of power.
When the fall leaves your home, it'll last you a few years.
The storm amplifies the freshness.
Down until the flames in my mouth, they get hurt.
Happiness, the first I always see, so drunk.
For a silence, all we broke down.
By the sight of freedom.
In my throat, in this floor, this yellow gold.
A tricky feeling of fear.
But I quickly lose it.
And joy, it goes away.
So be crazy on my own.
To forget the first thing.
When everything was set and done, you gave your love, but I won't have none.
Was I fooled to think that you and I could last.
The memories of me won't return.
Future plans have been erased.
And I do what you promise.
I just made you feel oppressed.
And they I hope I'll recognize it now and run.
It's not a dream of things, but a sin.
It's the highway alone in bed.
I hope that dreams will sleep on fire.
I hope that you will be mine.
And I'll sit and drink alone.
I can't get you on the phone.
I'm gonna drink this bottle of drugs.
I wish that I could die.
I used to play to come back now.
Had that phone and a wonder how.
Take me back after all the pain that I put you through.
I guess it's time to realize.
I'll be done with all my lies.
Take those words and be met you and die off through.
It's not a dream of things, but a sin.
It's the highway alone in bed.
I hope that dreams will sleep on fire.
I hope that you will be mine.
And I'll sit and drink alone.
I can't get you on the phone.
I'm gonna drink this bottle of drugs.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I see you flying around my head.
You again standing beside my bed.
Standing beside my bed.
Be so torn red.
I see you facing the mirror.
Staring back at me.
I wonder who could you be.
Now I'm in my car.
I'm driving way too far.
I look in the mirror.
I see your eyes there.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
I wish that I could die.
You have risen again, standing on this clear,
Staring into the sea, the water it is deep,
The water it is cruel, the waves are calling me,
I dive into the air, I dive into the air, I dive into the air.
Oh, I'm beneath the waves, I'm sinking a light stone,
My flesh and bones are cold, and I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
She would be little, I'll get over her life, she would tell her to do what she ought to,
She would be little, and she could mistake,
She would be little, I'll get over her life, she would tell her to do what she ought to,
She would be little, I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone, I stand all alone,
I stand all alone,
we can't wait until the end of our country,
still updated to Paralyze ahead,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no so sleep!
You have to be a monster because you never wonder why we're so inspired and the rest
of them tired. You have to be a bastard because it just doesn't matter that you are now much better and we just
do your life better.
You insist you are an angel giving hope to those who paid you what pain do you discover when your
lies are on cover. You have to be an artist, the fool the ones who know you best.
You have to learn a long time to get some fucking stone blind.
Been away from you and away from me and away from you but I still can see that away from you is away from me.
Glad to start our own, the structure's made of stone. Do we want to be alone?
You have to be a monster who resides instead of fire but with one show of desire your laugh will then expire.
You have to be a fighter if you want to get much higher. You live so much longer, become so much stronger.
I've been away from you and away from me, I'm away from you but I still can see that away from you is away from me.
Glad to start our own, the structure's made of stone. Do we want to be alone?
Next time I come what will you do?
Next time I come what will you do?
Next time I come what will you do?
Next time I come what will you do?
Next time I come what will you do?
Next time I come what will you do?
Hard for the coldest man, God for the saddest song, feel you to spring again.
Next time I come what will you do?
You have to be a fighter if you want to get much higher.
But I won't make it up, brought sitting in the field, mother come running home.
Dark is the coming storm, cry from Neptune.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
Break all the finest wine, give me a heaven sign.
Ladies are born to die, force and the cattle cry, stop all this bar will die.
Give me only one, give me only one who stays.
This world is crazy and it's spiraling, fast down the drain.
Give me only two, who's gonna make it?
No, they can't take it, but how hard they try.
Everybody's gone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
It's a funny thing, when I can't look you in the eye.
After all this time, do you think we'd stop trying to hide?
Let's go away to a place of peace.
Leave it all behind, almost things at least.
Everybody's gone.
Give me only two, who's gonna make it?
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
I will leave alone, stop at the drinking stone.
To be everything for all and all is my dream.
I just want to become me.
I just need someone to be close to me.
Everything for all and all is my dream.
I just want to become me.
