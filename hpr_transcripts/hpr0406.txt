And so,
Hi everyone, this is Clat 2, this is hacker vote radio and I've got an interview, a group
interview on how to make moon shine after you've made your coffee and your meat, you can
try this one.
The interview is with Cover 2 from UnixPorn.com, Alan Hicks from Slackware, one of the IT
guys from Southeast Linux Fest and I think art 61 from Linux Cranks or otherwise known
as evil as and probably some other guys came around but yeah this is it, this is how to
make moon shine.
I never heard anything quite like this before so I just, they were standing around talking
about moon shine and stuff like that and I just had to hit record on my recorder.
So it's pretty unique, I like to think it captures a little bit of that southern flavor
for sure.
I'm not sure how I feel about Cover 2, taking a perfectly good coffee machine and making
it into a moon shine still but you know, you got to do what you got to do I guess.
So listen in on the interview, enjoy it.
Alright, and once you take a bond coffee bond, reason you take a bond because it has
been thermostat inside of it with a reservoir that keeps the water warm through coffee.
So when you pour in cold water, it fills up the reservoir and it bakes out the hot water
so you get to fruit as soon as you pour it in.
Alright, so basically you got out of it, leave thermostat in the reservoir and then you
pop a hole about half way outside or oh and you got to take some proper sheet and wine
and you get to get the coffee inside.
Yeah, it's got to be coffee.
I can't eat coffee now.
I can't eat anything.
I can't eat coffee.
You can't be a call ready and it's got to be coffee.
And you have to make sure that your solar everything sealed and you make a little tip about
half way apart and runs outside.
Here's a little on some flashing tools.
That's what you call right.
Flinch.
Yeah.
Flinch.
Yeah.
Flinch.
What it does is it makes easy to slide on actions and then you solar those but are you
going to use the word raise?
We're not sovereign.
Anyways, you make the raise of the flange coming out from the reservoir that way you can
take your extra bottle and shove right on and you make a bottle out of a piece of coffee
sheet and have like pressure release on the end of it.
So you fill it up and catch a finger over the top of it and shut it on with the go.
Yeah.
A little steam will leak out of it because you don't have a thumper barrel in the situation.
Yeah.
What's a thumper barrel?
Well, if you get the mash too hot, it'll bowl and puke up and you don't want that to
go into your bottles enough.
All right.
So you just have a barrel there and if it puke up, you'll hear it falling.
It's not a thumper barrel.
That keeps you from getting in here.
Now, what is this mash stuff?
What do you mean?
Mash.
Mash.
Mash is basically the flavor of the moonshine.
Yeah.
But let me get back to the design.
We'll go into.
Oh.
Here in a second.
All right.
Still has an a-hole.
It means on the top of the reservoir there's a copper cap, basically, that captures all
the steam and it runs up circles eight times and runs over through the top of the coffee
pot down to where the coffee filter is.
Calls down in a plastic tube that connects to a carbon filter and then turns right into
your coffee pot.
Yeah.
Basically, what you're doing is you're heating the mash up and the alcohol will begin to evaporate
out of it as it could go up through those tubes and then you cool it back and down so
that it becomes liquid again.
Okay.
That's basically all you're doing.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, that makes sense.
So what's the mash?
The mash is a mixture for the flavor there.
And you just dump that stuff.
Mainly corn and you want to take broke corn kernels if you can.
Oh, look at it.
Look at it.
I don't know what you want to go for.
You have a hash sprouted and you crack.
Oh, right.
Some people use all of these.
It's corn based.
I don't recommend that.
Just like a corn on a cob.
You just take the corn on the cob.
Yeah, you talk about the corn on the cob.
Yeah.
But dry.
Yeah.
Okay.
You don't want them wet.
Okay.
So you dry out a corn on the cob and like just cut off the corn on the chocolate.
Yeah.
And then you can either crack them, grind them up.
You can throw them in their home if you want to.
Yeah.
Don't really do that.
You can get some good flavor.
If you wet them just a little bit and let them start to sprout.
Oh, yeah.
Then they'll come out and crack them.
Okay.
Some people do that.
Yeah.
Oh, just fans.
Just Google for it.
And you'll find a dress thing.
Yeah.
Some people are getting really creative.
And they, like, fruit.
Like, like, peach.
Yeah.
You might like that.
Usually you just add it out.
Oh, yeah.
And then I was on my way to close part of the match.
My granddaddy.
He throws a piece of corn mash.
And he throws a rat head on a peach.
No.
Well, the rat heads her bacteria.
It makes the corn grow.
A rat head.
A rat head.
You chop off a rat head.
The bacteria causes the corn to...
I mean, rats are like the carriers of like the bubonic flag or something.
243 alcohol.
Yeah.
He'll eat everything.
And you're going to drink this stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, this is challenging.
Well, we could brunch with Steve when he chopped up.
Paul would say it inside.
Mm-hmm.
And that's how we like him.
Just big.
Yeah.
Just for demonstration.
I'm holding my arms about what?
Four foot of...
Yeah.
About four foot apart.
Mm-hmm.
About this time.
About three feet.
Now shut that hot for this long stick.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's about three foot.
Over.
Over.
Over.
Hey.
Woodfire.
You won't learn how to get brunch.
Yeah.
That's better.
All right.
I get all the loose on me.
I don't think I know.
Yeah.
You can see it.
They eat it.
What?
It's legal for you to make three gallons a year for your own party.
Yeah.
That's what I was actually going to ask about the legality.
I understood it was legal, but it's not necessarily.
It is.
But only to a certain extent.
The legality of the still.
I think you can have it.
Well, I think one gallon.
You can't have it.
No.
Oh, yeah.
You can't make it and eat it.
You can't make it and take it.
Yeah.
Across the state line or anywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.
Why?
Because you don't pay taxes on it.
Mm-hmm.
It's for your own personal consumption.
Yeah.
You can make up the three gallons a year.
According to them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Inburg.
Yeah.
Yeah, alright.
So, you cut it up, ground up, we got the).
You cut it up, ground up around there it.
It's aboutUM chart for we got it it ta t.
Yeah.
Again.
How long is it shooting?
Should you cook it?
Because none.
5 days.
I don't know how long, you want two?
Inburg theater?
Is inburg theater?
Are you drinking?
How long does it shoot?
Two minutes.
Cool.
All night, give me my time.
Dw.
I think it is caused.
I think it is.
Qu passiert.
I was just curious if the presence of a hog head might affect cook time.
Keep the lid on.
Keep on moving.
You gotta read it.
He'll stick to the bottom of that hog.
And he'll burn and burn it.
Yeah, oh Gauley.
Yeah, that's the worst thing in the world even though he's burning.
He had to do these to the pig roast.
He has to do this.
That's what I'm saying.
He was a big roast for several hours.
He got to pull it back.
Yeah, we was having to explain it all, but you put a drink on. I don't drink and I don't eat
friends with stews. You don't eat meat. You don't eat meat? No, I don't eat meat.
I don't eat meat. I don't eat vegetables. I'm serious. I had eggs in the back in the
morning, I had chicken for lunch and I got some chicken or steak for dinner. Yeah, I had
1000s and then ground up beef and I intended steak not. I could eat that I ain't eating
some meat. I couldn't figure out a way how to get the dang grill strapped on the back of
my car. You should put his truck. What's the next thing I would do there?
It's a hot-gallon drum that I was cutting. Yeah, I cut it bottom off and it's custom.
Yeah, I like the mood. I don't want a civic dude. You've been seen put on a Honda Civic?
I ain't doing that. You know what that does to transmission? That's why I had to replace the other one.
It even for me decided to drag around as a little motorcycle. Oh God. Through the mountains.
Why didn't he just ride the motorcycle through the mountains? That seems like it was heavy.
Have you ever seen, you know, they got those... I think this dude, and he did a trailer receiver
head all along those Honda Civic and you open up the trunk. And you can just see the bolts
to that receiver head through the seat belt. Through the seat belt. Through the seat belt on the trunk
floor. There's no frame back there, really. You know. Not really, but there's a little bit.
Not sort of this one was both the same, but... They were like, they were just long.
That's it. That's it. What happened? Man, you need to get used to taking care of them, you know.
It's like a real Ryan. I had a truck. I had to sail. Why didn't you sail the car?
The car got better gas in the mountains. Yeah. That's kind of why I'm going to be out of the train.
I was training you out on the car, so you want to get your family to back. The extra
axle kind of rides there. Like the tough truck. There you go.
They're a lot wily dogs.
Really?
When they hit the front of the truck.
When you had to put them all in the front.
Come on. 12 seconds.
But that's awesome. You could steer while doing a wheelie.
Yeah, come on.
I don't know how they got to work you, bro. No.
No. You can spin in tires. It's not really going to happen.
You made that horn to sit, but we'll actually spin the tires.
I can run it all the way out and first hit the second, about halfway through.
Custom gear?
You know, if you've got rebuild transmission, you might boy.
I didn't rebuild it. I don't play one.
I still get 40 miles for the gas.
Oh, yeah.
I get a mantra.
