This is Hacker, public radio episode 4469 for Thursday 18 September 2025.
Today's show is entitled, Disagree with me three statements about life-living.
It is the tenth show of Semla's M. St. Louis and is about six minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Semla's M. St. Louis, who is not a life hacker, thinks that he thinks
as one.
Hello and welcome to another episode of Hacker, public radio, today with our friends Antoine.
And the theme is, Disagree with me, tips of life hacking.
I will try to practice, to come with this one without a script.
So I hope you have patience for my going back and forward on my words.
But first, because I'm not good at communicating at all.
And at second, because English is not my mother tongue.
I will share with you three things I think about life, but I'm not a life hacker.
I do not feel like one, because I have a disturbed life, a disturbed mind that comes
to a disturbed life.
But I have some simple thoughts, simple way of thinking, of things that, for me, are
obvious, but what I see on the world around is different.
For example, it's better to have one million dollars and lose it all, spend it in bad
investments and be on zero, and then you'll have five dollars in using it for something.
But you don't lose five, you lose ten dollars in the process.
That is, in one case, you lose everything you have, you start on zero.
In another case, you are owing someone who are in debt, that is a problem.
You lost more than you have, so what you lost, it's more than being no zero.
It's like I prefer to be one hour earlier than to be five minutes later in an appointment.
It's my way of thinking, disagree with me.
Another thing, is to be productive in work, you have to work how you are proposed to
do it.
In general, your work is to do this kind of job from this hour to this hour.
So what we have to do, do that kind of job from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Like it's my today routine of my work.
So in that time, I have 15 minutes, I can spend in a coffee break, and I usually do because
I'm more productive doing an interval, more than being paralyzed in front of the computer,
like being present is being productive, no, no, I don't have to show anything more than
doing my work in the right pace.
But what I can do is spend that time, seeing my mail, getting lost on my cell phone, social
media, and everything.
I can have my leisure time in my leisure time, not in my work time.
And I don't have to go, go earlier to home, and I don't get to get later at the job.
And so on and so on.
That is, we would be so much more productive if we obey to what we have to do instead of
being present and thinking, oh, if I'm here in my seat, I am being productive and everything
sees me as someone who works.
I don't have, you don't have to prove yourself by appearance, this appearances.
And if you are at Hacker Public Radio, maybe you already know that being a hacker, many
times it's been more autonomous, being more conscient, having more conscience about what
is a good job, a good work, instead of only appearances, instead of wasting the time
that you, you, you are greeted to sell to someone.
That is what a paid job is, you sell a partial time of your day, instead of an exchange
of money.
So do that well.
And the last ones in that line is, doing this is having a purpose.
If you find a purpose at your work, if you find a purpose in the way you use your money,
the word joy has all to do with purpose, because you enjoy what you have joined in seeing
that done and doing that.
In that things, everyone or most of people have to do like exchanging time of life for
money, for conditions to live in all the rest of the time, that is, working, paid work.
If you find something good of it, you have more chance of having an enjoyable life.
That said, disagree with me or agree, I thank you for listening for my non scripted
show today, bye, bye.
