Good day Hacker Public Radio. Hey, I saw the emails from Ken about needing some shows and
well I hadn't been really been doing that much hands on stuff but this week one of the guides
from the server room which we're trying and so we moved some racks around and some new things got
done and I thought I'd share with you and you know first you know the joy of your you know
he's worked for the company for almost 50 years now and you know stepping back out of the
server room and you know going on going to be with his woman now for a little while and so
at the there's that you know the passage of time and I wanted to talk a little bit about the
leap of 15.3 and all of its LXFCE and an LQ goodness so I switched out the that little AMD terminal
server that I had downstairs so you know I'm I'm I have a passion for finding on eBay old Fujitsu
terminals and turning them into like little appliances or whatever and this one
was really interesting because I was it had it it had an M2 slot and a hard drive slot in it then
so and it went up to four gigabyte to ram and so it was a the only thing is is it has a very very
small CPU with two logical cores and even now it's it idle it's with VNC running it's about 9.3
so it's just over a gigabyte so I have an instance downstairs or a LX a QT instance running downstairs
and an XFCE instance running and DNC up here in the house and so it's about one one gigabyte out
of the four so 1.1.05 gigabyte and it's running at 4% right now and the Fujitsu let's see if you
want to try to replicate it it's a it's a Fuji S900N and so you can find them all over the internet
for almost next to nothing and like I said they have an M2 slot on them you got to take out the
the little M2 slot that it had the whatever whatever virtualization thin client was in there and you
just put a normal M2 in it and then I took the grill on the side and put a 500 gigabyte hard drive
also since there was a power extra power adapter on the inside of the little PCHit power adapter
so I was able to get that in and the most you can get on the on the terminal was 4 gigabytes
like I said the CPU is relatively is relatively we off on that stuff but but and it had been
a while since I had got my Susan on and to see where they were and so I was like 153 and and you know
the the beautiful thing about Susan that if you're not very this very smart person you can use
you asked and and get an awful lot done and and so the the web browser you can you can use the
VNC in the web browser I actually went downstairs because for some other reason it dropped and so I
just went downstairs log back in and made sure that the Wi-Fi connection was working on the thing and
typed a VNC server and then it came right up on the instead of the whatever that was the I think
5801 it came up onto the 901 on the VNC so I'm able to play with it up here and I'll be running an
NFS server on that 500 500 gigabytes and it was it was pretty interesting getting that extra that
extra server to the touch and everything so if I go to it and use well you know it's because
so many desktops and saw there's so many tools but let's see accessories and what do we got
leadpad mousepad RLQE ARCGARVER file catcher application finder let's use the application finder
and let's find a file file associations file manager Pacman let's launch that bad boy
okay so if I go to so it shows my home directory when I bring up Pacman home slash JWP1 and it came
up pretty quick and of course the the it has to share on it and if I go extra data it actually so I
made a symbolic link in the home directory home directory and let's see if it still lets me
write it so let's let's go open one thing I really wish it would do it not open with Libra
office for a text file so now we'll be waiting for just a second while that Libra office does
thing I don't need the next two so let's type in hi there and file save and I don't want to
ODT document I want to just even offer a text document does it even offer a text document I don't
think it does HD now I've got text so it offers does offer text so let's use text one okay and so
yeah so so the permissions that I put in there it's actually that CH mod and then and then make the
drive available to all users and I mean there's a million odd ways to go about it to go about it
but I always find that you find that the CH mod on that 777 is the way to go for that extra
disco so of course the next step is for me to share that over the NFS NFS so it's it's fiancee all
the time it's it's NFS and it's probably I'm probably going to move my sinful drop box sink from
the work server room to to that little little Fujitsu downstairs because number one it's always on
and number two it'll see the the Intel the the nook upstairs has the drop box on it and the
the if I put it downstairs then there's two copies of it both on pretty small transportable
things and so with drop box that you can only have two clients it's it's almost as bad as ever
these days ever not these days and interestingly on that topic the my workplaces really big on
the Microsoft products but if you just use the Microsoft products with your phone it's not that bad
and particularly on the Android side of things so if you just thought about using one note and then
Microsoft lends on your Android phone it's it's not really that bad of a that bad of a thing
that bad of a thing from a practicality thing of course you know if you want to have a Linux phone
and you want to do it with Linux that's great but the problem that I have is that so many people want
five or ten or fifteen dollars and it appears that if you that if you just use the the
the one note Android client and the Microsoft Office Lens client and you have a Microsoft Live account
they won't charge you the 365 every year for your for your for your note taking and so I found
that to be a little bit easier than what I was trying to get with evernote with evernote or the
free and if in any I want to do an exercise and what might be good or have similar functionality to
one note and Microsoft Lens that would be fantastic and the and the HPR and the HPR landscape
well guys it's almost ten minutes and I've talked a little bit about the Suza 15.3 it's it seems
pretty solid it's a little different than my Davian or Ubuntu stuff that I normally do and like
I said you do it off on the YAST so if you're not really familiar with RPM or the different technology
or zyper everything it happens from ZAST and ZAST in the command line and what I really liked about it
is that is that all of the hard things that you know you have to look up on it in the line and go
through like the digital ocean or or tutorial or whatever to get to to work you can do all of that
with YAST and it pretty much works every time all right hey I hope you all are all being safe
in the COVID and staying away from the Delta and all of that neat stuff I'm getting ready to fly
to the States in the September and I wish y'all a well and hope y'all are good if anyone wants to
