Hello Hacker Public Radio listeners, this is Andrew here, as I'm also called, and we are going to be talking about Magnetune today and I'm in my home and I'm delighted to be joined by Dave.
How are you?
I'm great, thank you.
Thanks for the invitation to your nice house.
Yes, that's a bit warm at the moment because I'm trying to cure a water leak problem.
So if you're expanding for great that's fine.
So yes, we're going to talk a bit about Magnetune and listen to some tunes.
Magnetune, it's a bit quiescent until recently that's of walking up again, hasn't it?
Yeah, yeah, I think they were.
They've done really well over the years. They've been around for a long time now.
I don't know if you remember exactly how long.
But they seem to have sort of hit a choir to patch recently.
They changed the way that they sell their music.
So you have to be a member, you can't buy anything individually and again.
There's only one membership now, isn't there?
Maybe different sorts of membership.
And so that showed that the original model needed some tweaking.
And then as you say, they went really quiet.
I was, myself, I was worried how they just about to vanish, you know.
They didn't.
No, no.
I've got feeling it's been around since 2003, so it's quite a while actually.
I think I must have encountered it a good four to five years after that.
Maybe before I can't quite remember.
Yes, yes.
We did.
I think I did look at the sub last time we did a show about it.
And I don't remember anything about what it was now.
But yeah, it's been around a goodly long time because they were pushing themselves quite hard at one point.
You would, I think if you wrote to them, you got a great stack of business cards type thing.
Because they wanted you to go and spread them around wherever you were and your friends and that sort of stuff.
And it worked, I think, because they seem to get quite a number of people interested in the business and everything at that time.
So yeah.
But now I think it's not their primary business, is it?
They've got other strings to their bow now.
So they've sort of cut back somewhat, I think, in terms of who runs the show and the sort of facilities they offer.
But they still got a pretty solid core of them.
So I don't want to say that it's primarily, it's the brainchild of John Buckerman.
And another nice thing is if you email him, he'll email you back.
Which is quite nice.
Can I share that chat with him?
It's unlike a lot of startups, especially going to start up going back that far.
It'll be a blaze of publicity at the beginning and it'll be the next most exciting thing since sliced bread and all the rest of it.
I suppose it made it, maybe it went through that, but I wasn't aware of it at the time.
It was nice about this.
It's found in niche, it seems to have a small, probably too small for the business model that maybe he originally hoped for.
But quite a loyal band of followers.
And I'm surprised that when I met you first through, I guess it was through Identic or Hack-A-Public Radio.
And then only later did we discover that we had Magnitude in common.
And I've had to happen a few times.
So there's a niche.
There's a few quite a few of us about, you know, if you ask.
You go on the high street, you'll find many Magnitude devotees.
But it's nice it's kept going.
And he's found a way to keep it going even though it's not a mega box venture like Spotify.
It's wonderful to see really in these days where, you know, it's sort of so many businesses thrive a little more and then vanish totally.
It's lovely that this one has stayed alive and has sort of settled down to a steady pace almost.
You know, it's good.
And from a hiatus, because the way I was measuring their sort of state of wellbeing was that they produced a list of new acquisitions, new albums and so forth.
There's an email list you could join as a member.
And that was every couple of weeks, I think, wasn't it?
Yes, it was, you know, looking regularly.
Yeah.
And then that stocked for a while.
It seemed a little bit worrying.
And now it's gone back to every couple of weeks again.
So that's absolutely great.
And it seems to be some pretty good stuff coming along as well.
And they seem to have some artists who have stuck with them all the way through, which is also great.
Yes, it is good.
I'm sure, to say, part of the idea of magnitude was to try and give the artists a bit of a better deal than they would get through Spotify.
And I guess going back to those days, was it called Last FM?
Was that the pre-before Spotify that was, like, the MySpace to Facebook thing, wasn't it?
The Last FM Spotify.
But, yeah, generally, it gives, I think, it's a better deal for the artists as far as I understand it.
And the emails are good, because every couple of weeks I said, welcome sight in my inbox.
And I think of how many emails are unwelcome with my inbox.
Firstly, all of the rest.
It's nice when I see John Buckman has sent through his email and he's got four or five new albums.
And it might not be new.
The way we've been on for a while, but he's added them just a little bit.
It's a remainder I think.
But they're new to me, anyway, it's usually.
Well, that's fine.
I mean, I don't mind the other way.
There's things, because he puts a player into the HTML message.
And normally, I don't read HTML, but this one, I've made an exception.
Yeah, and you say you can play a bit of it from straight out of the email.
Oh, I quite like that.
And I just go and buy them pretty much straight away as a consequence.
What would you say buy them?
You just download them?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I do the same.
I mean, out of every four, usually there's one that I really like.
And then there's a couple of which are okay.
And there's one which I really don't like.
There's a real range.
I think we're in common that we've probably both lean towards the ambient and the electronic.
Again, because of the kind of thing magnitude, I can see why it's attracted.
There's quite a lot of classical stuff.
There's a lot of classical stuff.
I do collect all the classical stuff, actually.
I don't listen to it as a sort of background as much as I do the electronic and ambient stuff.
Because I quite like that music on when I'm coding or doing something like that.
But yeah, so the classical stuff is sometimes a little bit more challenging.
And you want to actually listen to, still quite like that, to have it, you know,
for those times when you have Apple Walk or something,
you've got the headphones on.
If you want to do something or in the car or something like that,
it's quite nice to do a thing.
So yeah, this is a good range.
Yeah, that's fine.
And also the classical stuff seems to contain quite a lot of quite old,
like early classical music and maybe even more meaningful music.
Which I tend to prefer.
Oh, that's not completely true.
But I guess, again, with the way Magnetune is,
that it's quite, it would be quite undertaken to get a whole orchestra set up.
That's quite an expensive thing to do.
Whereas medieval and older music, you know, you can get away with the quartet or even a song.
Yes, that's true.
That's true.
That's true.
I have had some orchestral stuff, I think.
In some cases, people have used Magnetune as a springboard onto other things.
And then they disappear, which is sad.
For example, there was a group, I guess they were an orchestra,
who did a series of three CDs worth of stuff,
which was a handle opera called Atelanta,
which I never heard of before.
Sorry, or Magnetune, grabbed it.
It's absolutely wonderful.
Right, child.
But it's not there anymore.
Yes, sadly gone.
I mean, I understand that could happen.
I've never actually happened with an album that I happened to have liked.
But then if I really like an album, I'll have downloaded it.
And since there's no DRM or anything like that,
you get to keep it so presumably you've still got this.
So that's another nice thing.
Magnetune has control over what's there,
but has no control over something that you've then downloaded,
which seems to be appropriate in both sides.
It should be by my right.
I think it's great.
I guess there's a license that allows us to do what we're doing here
and play it on a podcast and non-commercial podcast.
It's why it's...
It's easy by NC.
Yes, that's the one.
We did check that out last time.
But so we can do that.
If an artist leaves, I guess,
the quite sure what consideration regards the licensing then?
I don't know.
I've got a change.
I don't know.
I've never looked into that one.
No, it's an interesting question.
We're not doing it.
Yeah, we're actually going to listen to the music live
in between our recordings,
although you'll edit the tracks in, actually.
I shouldn't spoil it.
I shouldn't spoil it.
We'll spoil the scene too.
Sorry about that.
But it does mean that when we listen to it,
I will be extremely alive from Magnetune.
That guarantees that still there.
Yes.
So on that note, should we listen to the first track?
Yes, that's true.
Okay, so we're showing three tracks each.

Yeah, so that was Rodrigo from Album Helium by Pretty Howtown, a pretty howtown as
all spilled, nor case, all run together, no camel caps or anything like that, camel case rather,
but it's actually just one guy, John Noble, and he builds his own synthesizers, it's all analog,
it's all old-school, and I think he said he records all live as well, and I think that's what I like
about it, I mean it's quite electronic, but there's something quite human about it as well,
it's not being quantized by a digital sequencer or anything like that, and although that's called
Rodrigo, Rodrigo of course is Spanish guitarist, and a favourite of my mum and dad, so that's my dad
just died recently, so I'm going through all their correspondence, and they used to write to each
other about Rodrigo and Sagovia, and so Rodrigo was the composer, sorry, Rodrigo was the guitarist,
Sagovia of Sagovia, sorry, Sagovia, Sagovia, sorry, was the guitarist that they went to see
playing Rodrigo, and although that's about as a musical instrument goes, about as far away from
an acoustic classical guitar as you could get, there is something a little bit about it,
which I can see why he called it Rodrigo. I can imagine somebody playing that sort of thing with
the guitar, I mean, somewhere in there, it's somewhere in there, it's so much plucky, it's
something, it's slightly… yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I actually saw Sagovia, pretty soon, Sagovia died in the 70s, 80s sort of thing, I think. Yeah, so I think you performed him
Manchester when I was a student, and I went to see him. Yeah, well, my, I've, for some reason I went, my dad
took me to see him when I was a tiny boy, I must have been four or five, and I didn't last past the
interval, it was in the Kelvin Hole in Glasgow, I think the plan was that he was going to go with my mum,
but my mum was ill or my little sister was a baby or something you know and my mum had to stay
home so my dad took me I don't remember anything about it at all other than being in the hall
and all the people and exciting for a yes until the interval at which point I said to my dad I
went to go home because I'm sleepy and this is boring and my dad was not happy but so yeah
and yeah that's why it's a bit repetitive that track but I do recommend those those albums if you
like old-fashioned analog music it's I do recommend those albums helium hydrogen alpha and hydrogen
beta which also appeals to this dronomer physicist in me when we albums after atomic lines
yeah yeah yeah it's it's also one I like but I've listened to one of those albums in there
I'm really good okay so shall we move on to um to my choice then yes so I am choosing
a an artist whose name is skin mechanics and the album is called secret life of angels and the track
is called ultra vista
oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I don't know how to do it, but I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't

I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it,
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it
So yeah, I just really enjoyed that type of music, so this one was a definite hit with me when I came across it
It's not new though, according to the blurb, it's dated around 2002 to September 2002
It said, the album made its debut at Jodrol Bank Planetarium that month and the audience reaction was very positive and enthusiastic
Well, I would think so, imagine being in a Planetarium listening to us or music, that would be very, very cool, I think
It would, well, actually, I can see that with some convection because two weeks ago I went to the Glasgow Planetarium, it's got a big one, a few hundred seats I forget, maybe 150 people
It's a feeling sizable, I think, and they had an old computer image or generated image or video projected up into the whole dome to a company dark side of the moon by Pink Floyd
Oh, very cool
I mean, I'm not actually that huge-linked Pink Floyd, I like it, but it's not my first choice of music, but it did like it
But it really suited this, and it's hard to describe unless you see it, but the visuals were disorientated and you get feeling of movement
Because they were surrounding you, especially some of the 3D tricks they played on you, it went really well with the music
I can really vouch that a Planetarium is a great place to listen to music
Even if you just look at the stars, to be honest, I actually really like that track as well, and I've got it to my laptop, I haven't listened to it for some time
Because I think I got it mixed up with another band, I got off magnitude and I didn't like so much, but now I know I actually do like it
It's got a kind of groove to it, which is quite a neutral and electronic music
Yes, it's got a rhythm, it's not a rhythm, but you know, it's a groove, it's the right thing to do
You get your marches along, it pulls you along
Yeah, sort of way
Yes, I guess it might be slightly dated form, but I don't really know enough about the comparison between the different types of this kind of music
But yeah, I mean in fact it sounded like Tangerine Dream, first of all dates it, but secondly, it means it's something I want to listen to over and over again
It made me think a little bit of Jean-Michel Jarre, who was in the early 80s
I was thinking of BBC Micro Model Bs, which to our non-UK friends, I guess that's the cousin of Commodore 64, Vic 20
Yeah, yeah, it was that year
It was a lot more to process it
Yeah, although the B was, had quite a lot more extras than those guys did I think, did it?
Yeah, it was something more expensive
Yeah, it was 400 pounds
Yeah, it was an expensive box
Yeah, but it reminds me of, it reminds me of that, you know, music as well on my home
And I was a, I was about 10, I think, 10, 12
And it made me make sure I was around there, heady
Good stuff
Okay, so the next track that I've picked is called Think Tank from the album Sleep Mode by Mike McGill

This is the first time I've ever done this before, and it's been a long time since I've been doing this for a long time.
I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time.
I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been
doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time,
and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time, and I've been doing this for a long time,
but then I'm not sure how I pronounced it at that time. So very well, I think that music is a somewhat
dumb tempo, quite gentle, very good music to have on while I'm working as well. Yeah, he's definitely
in my playlist. I haven't particularly chosen a track, I would have been hard-pressed to choose
a particular track, but it's the choosing of tracks to do this sort of thing with this is always
a difficulty I find, because you know it varies from day to day and mood and that type of thing,
but yeah, he's definitely definitely somebody I would like to hear more from and he's done stuff
recently. Yes, well this album dates back to 20th of April 2016, so it's just a little over a
year ago, so that shows, and it was from one of John Buckman's magnitude emails that I found him,
so it shows that the emails were still coming up fairly regularly, a year ago, so the hiatus must
have been the last six, still in months, I guess. Yeah, last, last caller of 2016, maybe that sort of time.
Yeah, so that would make sense, and I hear that album is very good at, we were just listening to it
there, my phone hooked up to my iFi and I pressed the button and I got, we wish you a Merry Christmas
came on, an instrumental version, because Mike seems to have done a Christmas album as well,
but it's electronic, so if you're feeling Christmassy later in the year and you can't tear yourself
away from the electronic, well, Mike's your man, it needs to be. Yeah, that's good to know, good to know.
Okay, so we move on to the next one, then my next choice is an artist called General Fuzz,
which appeals to me, I don't know why really, and his album is called General Fuzz,
and the track we have chosen is called Ray Squared.
