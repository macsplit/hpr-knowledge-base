So
Hello everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and today 50 years ago on April 12th, 1961,
Yuri Gagarin flew on the Vostok one spaceship in an orbit around the earth,
marking him as the first person to enter space and become the first cosmonaut slash astronaut.
Today in order to capture some of the feeling of that event, I'd like to first of all play
for you some of the recordings that I found which are on the copyright of the Soviet Union,
so I think we're safe enough to play them.
The first recording you're going to hear is the radio communications between Yuri Gagarin
and ground control.
And then after that I'll play you an excerpt from the Soviet exhibition in London 1961.
Then I'll continue on with having Danny speak, read out to you, first of all, a breakdown
of the flight as it occurred, and then finally we'll end off the show with the Wikipedia entry
read again by the e-speak text-to-speak engine.
I hope you enjoy the show and I apologize to all the other hosts that I bumped down for
this one, but I thought this was too good an opportunity to miss marking out one of
the most important events of our time, so sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the show.
I'll be transmitting commands to you over, attention, one minute to launch, see there, this
is in my B in-dash one, one minute to launch, one minute to launch, Gagarin, I was taking
the start position, position taking, and still a response over, ground ignition key to
start position, ignition key to start position, Roger confirmed, brooch one, Roger brooch
one, spulsion, spulsion, Roger expulsion, key to drainage, key to drainage, this is
first one ignition, Roger has ignition, intermedius, lift off, wishes good flight, this
one minute later come or not what do I have now?
When the Kośmičai Quora volvyvostok o bakery.
He absurd our flight with one person,porter Yuria Halskuk fuck you guys,
In those historic minutes, when the spaceship for stock was orbiting the Earth, with the first astronaut Yuri Gagarin on board,
two-way radio contact was maintained between the Earth and the spaceship. Yuri Gagarin reported back to Earth how he was feeling and how the flight was going on.
During these brief communications, the Soviet astronaut sent messages.
I see the Earth, visibility good. I hear you perfectly. And sometime later, the flight is continuing well.
I see the Earth, visibility good. One can see everything. Some space is covered by cumulus cloud.
And then again, I am continuing with the flight. Everything normal, everything working perfectly, pressing on.
Sometime later, Yuri Gagarin reported again, feeling well. I'm in good spirits. I'm continuing with the flight. Everything is going well. The machine is working normally.
These laconic messages, full of carriage and confidence, which already today belong to history, were recorded on tape.
Here is this historic recording. Here is the voice of the world's first astronaut Yuri Gagarin from aboard the Soviet spaceship for stock.
Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin. Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin.
Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin. Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin. Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin.
Hello, my name is Gagarin.. Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin.
Hello, my name is Gagarin Gagarin, my name is Gagarin Gagarin.

Mazdaq won, meaning East won, or Orient won, was the first space flight in the Mazdaq program, and the first human space flight in history.
The Mazdaq 3K spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961.
The flight took Uricadarin, a cosmonaut from the Soviet Union, into space.
The flight marked the first time at a human-entered outer space, as well as the first orbital flight of a manned vehicle.
Mazdaq won was launched by the Soviet Space Program, and was designed by Soviet engineers, guided by Sergei Kauriliov and a military supervision of Kerim Kerimov and others.
The space flight consisted of a single orbit of the Earth. According to official records, the space flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing.
As planned, Kerim landed separately from his spacecraft, having ejected with a parachute 7 km, 23,000 ft above ground.
Historian Asif Cidikir has claimed that Kerim was in the space craft for 108 minutes after launch, and that he didn't touch ground for another 10 minutes.
Due to the secrecy surrounding the Soviet space program at the time, many details on the space flight only came to light years later, and several details in the original press releases turned out to be false.
Background
The world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik I, had been put into orbit by the Soviet in 1957, and this could be considered the beginning of the space race, between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Both nations wanted to develop their space flight technology quickly, and in particular, both wanted to be the first to carry out a human space flight.
The Soviet program for doing this was the Mostok program. Prior to a manned space flight, the Soviet launched several precursor and manned missions between May 1960 and March 1961,
to test and develop the Mostok rocket, and Mostok spacecraft technology. These missions had married success, but the final two were manned missions, core-rabble Sputnik IV, and core-rabble Sputnik V, where outright success is, opening the door for a manned flight.
Crew
A year old Yuri Gagarin was the only crew member on Mostok 1. The Mostok spacecraft were designed to carry a single cosmonaut.
The primary and secondary backup cosmonauts for the mission were guaranteed on, and rigor in a new bomb. The assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission,
but Gagarin had been a favorite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.
The final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of Nikolai Kaminin. In April 5th diary entry, Kaminin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov. He wrote,
the only thing that keeps me from picking Titov is the need to have the stronger person for the one-day flight. Kaminin was referring to the second mission, Mostok 2, which will last a full day, compared to the relatively short single orbit mission of Mostok 1.
When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy and Titov was disappointed.
On April 10, this meeting was re-acted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage on the event.
This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin. As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, Alexilianov, later recalled that he didn't know who was chosen for the mission until after the space flight had begun.
Preparations
Unlike later Mostok missions, there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead, they relied on the network of ground stations, also called command points to communicate with the spacecraft. All of these command points were located within the Soviet Union.
Because of weight constraints, there was no backup retro rocket engine. The spacecraft carried 10 pace of provisions to allow for survival and actual decay of the orbit in the event the retro rockets failed.
Automatic control
The entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot's manual controls.
In an unusual move, a code to unlock the controls were placed in an onboard envelope for Gagarin's use in case of emergency. But prior to the flight, common-in told Gagarin the code anyway.
April 11, 1961
On the morning of April 11, 1961, the Mostok K rocket, together with the attached Mostok 3K spacecraft, were transported several miles to the launch pad in a horizontal position.
Once they arrived at the launch pad, search a corollum inspected the rocket and spacecraft for problems, and without finding any, the rocket was raised into the upright position. At 10am, Mostok time, Gagarin and it were given a final review of the flight plan.
They were informed that launch was scheduled to occur at 9.07am Moscow time. This time was chosen so that when the spacecraft started to fly over Africa, which was when the retro rockets would need to fire for reentry, the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation system sensors.
At 6pm, once various physiological readings had been taken, the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions. At evening, Gagarin and it relaxed by listening to music, playing pool, and chatting about their childhoods. At 9.50pm, both men were offered sleeping pills to ensure a good night's sleep, but they both declined.
Physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts, to monitor their condition throughout the night, and they believed that both had slept well. Gagarin's biographer's door and, and vision, say that either Gagarin, nor did it have slept at night.
Coral of didn't sleep at night, Newton and I are to caused by the imminent space flight.
Mission
At 5.30am Moscow time, on the morning of April 12, 1961, both Gagarin and his backup did of work work and they were given breakfast, assisted in to their space suits,
and men were transported to the launch pad. Gagarin entered the post-op 1 spacecraft, and at 7.10 local time, for 10 UTC, the radio communication system was turned on.
Once Gagarin was in the post-op 1 spacecraft, his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera.
Launch would not occur for another 2 hours, and during the time Gagarin chatted with the mission's main capcom, as well as chief designer Sergei Korola, Nikolay Kaminin, and a few others.
Following a series of tests, and checks, about 40 minutes after Gagarin entered the spacecraft, its hatch was closed.
It was soon discovered that the seal was not complete, so technicians spent nearly an hour removing all the screws, and sealing the hatch again.
During this time, Gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio. Sergei Korola was very nervous in the lead-up to the launch.
He experienced chest pains, and took a built-up arm his heart. Gagarin, on the other hand, was described as calm, about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute.
Launch 6-0-7 UTC Launch occurs from the Macon or Cosmodrome site no.1. Korola radioed, preliminary stage, intermediate, main, lift off.
We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right. Gagarin replied, poy the carlit, off we go.
6-0-9 UTC 2 minutes into the flight, and the force trap on booster sections on the post-op rocket have used up the last-on-air propellant.
A shut-down, and drop away from the core vehicle.
T plus 119 seconds.
6-10 UTC per payload shroud covering post-op 1 is released. This uncovers the window at Gagarin's feet with the optical orientation device V-saw lit.
Look, all plans. T plus 156 seconds.
6-12 UTC 5 minutes into the flight, and the post-op rocket core stage has used up its propellant, shut-down, and falls away from the post-op spacecraft, and final rocket stage.
The final rocket stage ignites to continue the journey tour with.
T plus 300 seconds.
6-13 UTC per rocket is still firing, pushing post-op 1 toward orbit. Gagarin reports, not the flight is continuing well.
I can see the Earth. The visibility is good. I almost see everything.
And a certain amount of space under Cugula's cloud cover. I continue the flight, everything is good.
6-14 UTC per rocket continues to fire, starting to pass over central Russia now. Gagarin reports. Everything is working very well. All systems are working. Let's keep going.
6-15 UTC 3 minutes into the moon of the final rocket stage, and Gagarin reports. Marry a 1. Marry a 1. I can't hear you very well. I feel fine. I'm in good spirits. I'm continuing the flight.
Mostok 1 is moving further downrange from the Maconur Cosmodrome. He is reporting back to Marry 1, the Maconur ground station, and must be starting to move out of radio range on that station.
Time in orbit. Ground controllers did not know if a stable orbit had been achieved until 25 minutes after launch.
6-17 UTC the Mostok rocket, final stage shut down. 10 seconds later the spacecraft separates, and Mostok 1 reaches orbit.
T plus 6-176 seconds, Gagarin reports. The craft is operating normally. I can see Earth in the new port of the V-NOR. Everything is proceeding as planned.
Mostok 1 passes over Soviet Union, and moves on over Siberia.
6-21 UTC Mostok 1 passes over the Kamchatka Peninsula, and out over the North Pacific Ocean. Gagarin radios. The lights are on the descent mode monitor.
I'm feeling fine, and I'm in good spirits. Cockpit parameters. Pressure 1. humidity 65. Temperature 20. Pressure in the compartment 1. First automatic 155. Second automatic 155. Pressure in the retro rocket system 320 atmospheres.
6-25 UTC as Mostok 1 begins its diagonal crossing on the Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka Peninsula to the southern tip on South America. Gagarin asks.
What can you tell me about the flight? What can you tell me? He is requesting information about his orbital parameters. The ground station at Carverons report SPAC.
There are no instructions from number 20, sirgey corollion, and the flight is proceeding normally, a hot-elling Gagarin at a don't have his orbital parameters yet, because the spacecraft has been in orbit for only six minutes, but the spacecraft systems are performing well.
6-31 UTC Gagarin transmits to the Carverons ground station. I feel splendid. Very well. Very well. Very well. Give me some results on the flight.
Mostok 1 is nearing the VHF radio horizon for Carverons and may respond. Repeat. I can't hear you very well. Gagarin transmits again. I feel very good. Give me your data on the flight.
Mostok 1 passes out of VHF range on the Carverons ground station, and contact is lost.
6-37 UTC Mostok 1 continues on its journey as the sun sets over the North Pacific. Gagarin crosses into night, northwest of the Hawaiian Islands.
Out of VHF range with ground stations, communications must outake place MyRHF radio.
6-46 UTC Carverons ground station sends the message KKK MyRH telegraph on HF radio to Mostok 1.
This message means report the monitoring of commands. They were asking Gagarin to report when the spacecraft automated descent system had received its instructions from the ground control.
Gagarin reported back at 6-48 UTC.
6-48 UTC Mostok 1 crosses the equator at about 172 degrees west, traveling in a southeast direction, and begins crossing the South Pacific.
Gagarin transmits over HF radio. I am transmitting the regular report message. 9 hours 48 minutes, Moscow time, the flight is proceeding successfully.
Pusk 1 is operating normally. The mobile index of the descent mode monitor is moving. Pressure in the cockpit is 1.
humidity 65. Temperature 20. Pressure in the compartment 1.2. Manual 150. First automatic 155. Second automatic 155. Retro rocket system tanks 320 atmospheres. I feel fine.
6-49 UTC Gagarin reports keys on the right side of the earth.
6-51 UTC Gagarin reports the Sunseeking Attitude Control System has been switched on. The Sunseeking Attitude Control System is used to orient Mostok 1 for retrofire.
The automated orientation system consisted of two redundant systems. An automatic slash solar orientation system, and a manual slash visual orientation system.
Iver system could operate the two redundant cold-itrogen gas fluster systems, each with 10 kg 22 LV on gas.
6-53 UTC Gagarin reports Ground Station sends Gagarin the following message via HF radio.
My order on number 33, General Nikolai Kamenin, the transmitters have been switched on, and we are transmitting this. The flight is proceeding as planned, and the orbit is as calculated.
A tell Gagarin at Mostok 1 is in a stable orbit. He acknowledges the message.
6-57 UTC Mostok 1 is over the South Pacific between New Zealand, and Chile when Gagarin sends this message.
I'm continuing the flight, and I'm over America. I transmitted the telegraph signal on...
7-0-0 UTC Mostok 1 crosses the straight-on major at the tip of South America. New on the Mostok 1 mission is broadcast on radio Moscow.
7-0-4 UTC Gagarin sends spacecraft status message, similar to the 1-cent at 6-48. The message is not received by Ground Station.
7-0-9 UTC Gagarin sends spacecraft status message. The message is not received by Ground Station.
7-10 UTC passing over the South Atlantic, the Sun rises, and Mostok 1 is in daylight again. Mostok 1 is 15 minutes from retrofire.
7-13 UTC Gagarin sends spacecraft status message, similar to the 1-cent at 6-48. Mostok picks up this partial message from Gagarin. I read you well. The flight is going...
7-18 UTC Gagarin sends spacecraft status message, the message is not received by Ground Station.
7-23 UTC Gagarin sends spacecraft status message, the message is not received by Ground Station.
The automatic system brought Mostok 1 into alignment for retrofire about 1 hour into the flight.
Reentry and landing. At 7-25 UTC, the spacecraft automatic systems brought it into the required attitude, orientation, for the reentry engine firing, and shortly afterwards, the engine firing occurred, also known as retrofire.
This took place over the west coast of Africa, near Angola, about 8,000 kilometers, 5,000 miles from the desired landing point. The liquid fuel retro rockets fired for about 42 seconds.
Ten seconds after retrofire, command was sent to separate the Mostok service module from the reentry module, Sharic, but the Mostok equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires.
At around 7-35 UTC, the two halves of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong narrations as Mostok 1 near Egypt. At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude.
Gagarin telegraphed everything is okay, despite continuing narrations. He later reported that he did not want to make noise, as he could, correctly, reasoned that the narrations did not endanger the mission, and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module.
As Gagarin continued his descent, he experienced about 8G, Gagarin's own report states over 10G, during reentry, but remained conscious.
At 7-55 UTC, when Mostok 1 was still 7 km from the ground, the hatch on the spacecraft was released, and two seconds later Gagarin was ejected. At 2.5 km, 8,200 ft, altitude, the main parachute was deployed from the Mostok spacecraft.
Two schoolgirls witnessed the Mostok landing, and described the scene. It won a huge ball, about 2 or 3 meters high. It fell, and it bounced, and it fell again. It won a huge goal, where it hit the first time.
Gagarin's parachute opened almost right away, and about 10 minutes later, at 8-05 UTC, Gagarin landed. Both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute 26 km, 16 miles, southwest of Engels, in the Saratov region.
A farmer, and her daughter observed a strange scene of a figure in a bright orange suit with a large white helmet landing near M. by parachute. Gagarin later recalled, when they saw me in my space suit, and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear.
I told M, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet like you, who has descended from space, and I must find a telephone to call Moscow.
Reactions and legacy. Soviet Reaction. The Soviet press later reported, at minutes before boarding the spacecraft, Gagarin made a speech. Dear friends, you who are close to me, and you who might do not know, fellow Russians, and people of all countries, and all continents. In a few minutes a powerful space vehicle will carry me into the distant realm of space.
What can I tell you in these last minutes before the launch? My whole life appears to me as one beautiful moment. All that I previously lived through, and did, was lived through, and done for the sake of this moment.
He actually recorded the speech. A stream of myalities prepared by anonymous speech writers, in Moscow. American Reaction.
Officially the US congratulated the Soviet Union on its accomplishments. World Record. The FAI rules in 1961 required at a pilot must land with the spacecraft
to be considered an official space flight for the FAI record books. At the time, the Soviet Union insisted that Gagarin had landed with the postdoc. The government forced the cosmonaut to lie in press conferences, and the FAI certified the flight.
The Soviet Union admitted in 1971 at Gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the postdoc descent module.
When Soviet officials filled out the FAI papers to register the flight of postdoc one, they stated that the launch site was making a...
In reality, the launch site was near Duratam, 250 kilometers, 160 miles to the southwest of Meykenur.
A did this to try to keep the location on the space center a secret. In 1995, Russian and Kazakh officials renamed Duratam Meykenur.
Legacy. The landing site is our monument park. The central feature in the park is a 25 meter tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocket ship rising on a curved metallic column on flame, from a wedge-shaped, white stone base.
In front of this inner 3 meter tall, white stone statue of Uricagarin, with one arm raised in breeding, and another holding a space helmet. The statue is wearing a space suit.
In 2011, documentary film maker Christopher Riley partnered with European Space Agency last renaught Peiolo Nespoli to film a new view of what Gagarin would have seen on the earth from his spaceship, by matching video from the International Space Station to the ground path taken by postdoc one.
The resulting film, first orbit, is being released online to celebrate the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight. And on the Wikipedia article, from first orbit a free film to download and share created to celebrate the first 50 years of human spaceflight.
From HTTP www.firstorbit.org slash about the film. April 12, 1961. Uricagarin is about to see what no other person has seen in the history of humanity. The earth from space. In the next 108 minutes, you'll see more than most people do in a lifetime.
What site awaited the first cosmonaut silently gliding over the world below? What was it like to view the oceans and continent sailing by from such a height?
In a unique collaboration with the European Space Agency and the Expedition 26 slash 27 crew of the International Space Station, we have created a new film of what Gagarin first witnessed 50 years ago.
By matching the orbital path of the space station, as closely as possible, to cut off Gagarin's postdoc one spaceship, and filming the same vistas of the earth through the new giant Cubola window, as to not pay allownespoli, and documentary filmmaker Christopher Riley, have captured a new digital high definition new of the earth below half a century after Gagarin first witnessed it.
Weaving these new views together with historic recordings of Gagarin from the time. Subtitled in English and the original Stormi composer Philip Shepard, we have created a spell binding film to share with people around the world on this historic anniversary.
We have partnered with YouTube to share first orbit with the world in a special global streaming event on the 12th April. The Urizaite Network will also be showing the film at over 120 parties around the world at May.
If you would like to watch it at one of these events, then please contact the organizers directly through the Urizaite clickable party map.
And if there isn't a party near you, then why not make a date with our YouTube channel and organize your own party? You can register the event on the Urizaite website by clicking HTTP.urisite.net slashparty slashadself.php.
And if you are planning a big event and check out our details on how you can download the film in advance, to be part of our global premiere on the 12th April.
You can even download a poster from here to print out and advertise your screening. Whatever you do we'd love to hear how you shared first orbit and what you did to remember Uri, our first space man.
And on the first orbit article, Uri Gagarin from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia this is license under the creative commons attribution share alike license.
Uri Alex A. Vich Gagarin born on March 1934, 927 March 1968, was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut.
He was the first human to join in to outer space when his postdoc spacecraft completed an orbit on the Earth on April 12, 1961.
Gagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and honors, including hero of the Soviet Union.
Postdoc One marked his only space flight, but he served as backup to the Soyuz-1 mission, which ended in a fatal crash.
Gagarin later became deputy training director of the cosmonaut training center outside Moscow, which was later named after him.
Gagarin died when a training jet he was piloting crashed in 1968.
Early life.
Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gattsk, now in Smolensk, Russia, on the 9th March 1934.
The adjacent town of Gattsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honor.
His parents, Alex Ivanovich, Gagarin and Anna Timofievna Gagarin, worked on a collective farm.
While manual laborers are described in official reports as parents, this may be an oversimplification, if applied to his parents.
His mother was reportedly a voracious reader, and his father a skilled carpenter.
He was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him, while his parents worked.
Like millions of people in the Soviet Union, Gagarin family suffered during acid occupation in World War II.
After a German officer took over their house, the family constructed a small mud hut, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.
His two older siblings were deported to Nazi Germany for slave labor in 1943, and did not return until after the war.
In 1946, the family moved to Gattsk.
While the youth, Yuri became interested in space, and planets, and began to dream about his pastoral, which was one may become a reality.
After studying for one year at a vocational technical school in Ubertsy, Gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in Saratov.
While there, he joined the Arrow Club, and learned to fly a light aircraft, a hobbit would take up an increasing portion of his time.
In 1955, after completing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at Llorinburg pilot school.
While there, he met Malentina Gloria Schenver, whom he married in 1957, after gaining his pilot swings in MI-15.
Post graduation, he won a signed till Ubertsy in Murmansk last.
Close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky.
He became a lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force on the 5th November 1957, and on the 6th November 1959, he received the rank of senior lieutenant.
Career in the Soviet Space Program
Selection and training
In 1960, after the search and selection process, Ubertsy was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet Space Program.
Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi-Six, from which the first cosmonauts on the postdoc program would be chosen.
Gagarin and other prospective cosmonauts were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance.
He also underwent training for the upcoming flight.
Out of the 20 selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and German Titov, because of their performance in training, as well as their physical characteristics.
Space was at a premium in the small postdoc cockpit, and both men were rather short.
Gagarin was 1.57 meters, 5 foot 2 inches tall, which was an advantage in the small postdoc cockpit.
In August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, an Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows.
Modest. Embarrassed when his humor gets a little too racist. High degree of intellectual development evident in urea.
Quote fantastic memory distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings.
A well-developed imagination. Quick reactions. Persevering prepares himself painstakingly for his activities, and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics, and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excel in higher mathematics.
Does not feel constrained when he comes to defend his point of view, if he considers himself right.
Appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.
Unquote.
Soviet Air Force doctor, Gagarin was also a favored candidate by his peers.
When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for, which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but free chose Gagarin.
One of these candidates, Yamjun K.H. Runon, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding on himself, and others when necessary.
Gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and won a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Malarim Iconsky wrote.
Quote service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically, and morally. All on first Cosmonaut stuck up sports, and BTC seriously when we served in the Air Force.
I know that you regard Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goalkeeper. I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the Cosmonauts. Unquote.
In addition to being a key ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov industrial technical school team, as well as being a empire slash referee.
Space flight
On 12 April 1961, Gagarin became the first man to travel into space, launching tour bit aboard the Mostok 3K3, Mostok 1.
His call sign was Siberian pilot in his post flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience on space flight, having been the first human in space.
Quote the feeling of waitlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in traps.
You feel as if you are suspended. Unquote.
Following the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he could whistle the tune, the motherland hears, the motherland knows.
The first two lines of the song are, the motherland hears, the motherland knows where her son flies in the sky.
This patriotic song was written by the Metri Shostakovich in 1951, of 1986, with words by Evgeny Dolmetovsky.
After the flight, some sources claimed that Gagarin, during his space flight, had made a comment, I don't see any God up here.
However, no such words appear in the verbatim record on Gagarin's conversations with the Earth during the space flight.
In 2006, in the new close friend on Gagarin, Colonel Melentin Petrov stated that Gagarin never said such words, and that the phrase originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the central committee on the CISU,
where the anti-religious propaganda was discussed. In a certain context, Khrushchev said.
Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any God air. Colonel Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptized into the orthodox church as a child.
Rise to fame.
After the flight, Gagarin became a worldwide celebrity, touring widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan, and Finland to promote the Soviet coup of being the first country to put a human in space.
He also visited the United Kingdom three months after the postok won success, during which he visited the cities of London and Manchester, the latter, of which has been fondly remembered.
Life after postok won.
In 1962, he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
He later returned to Star City, the Cosmonaut facility, where he spent seven years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft.
He became Lieutenant Colonel or Podpelconik on the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1906 to 2, and on 6 November 1906 to 3 he received the rank of Colonel Polkernik on the Soviet Air Force.
The Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident.
Gagarin was back up pilot for Vladimir Comerov in the Soyuz-1 flight. As Comerov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was ultimately banned from training for, and participating in further space flights.
On 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from C.H. Kalovsky Airways, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seoyodin died in MI.
G-15 UTI crashed near the town of Kyrgyz. The bodies of Gagarin and Seoyodin were cremated, and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.
Gagarin had become deputy training director of the Star City Cosmonaut training base. At the same time, he began to requalify as a fighter pilot.
CAUSE OF GET CRASH
The CAUSE OF THE CRASH AT KILLED Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation, and conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.
Russian occupants declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government, and two military investigations.
The KGB report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions on their base personnel contributed to the crash.
The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin without aided weather information, and at either time on his flight, conditions that deteriorated significantly.
Browned crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather, and no outboard tanks.
The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird's strike, or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft.
Because of the outer bait weather report, the crew believed air altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not properly react to bring the MI.
G minus 15 out of its spin. In his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexilian on recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area at bay when he heard two loud moons in the distance.
corroborating other theories, his conclusion is at a Sukhojet, which he identified as a Su-15 flag on, was flying below its minimum altitude, and without realizing it, because of the terrible weather conditions.
He passed within 10, or 20 meters of URI, and surrogens plain, while breaking the sound barrier.
The resulting turbulence would have sent the MI. He did not uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was at a jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.
Another theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hyposcizes at a cabinet meant one accidently left open by the crew, or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation, and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.
A similar theory, published in air and space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent, and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude.
This dive caused him to lose consciousness, and crash. On 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin.
Government officials said at a sort no reason to begin a new investigation. In April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified.
Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was at either Gagarin, or so young and maneuvered sharply, likely to avoid the weather balloon, leading the jet into a supercritical flight regime, and its stalling in complex meteorological conditions.
The report also suggested that the jet may have been maneuvering sharply to avoid, entry into the upper limit on the first layer of cloud cover.
Legacy and Tributes
There were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to commemorate 20th and 30th anniversary of his flight. One ruble coin, 1981, copper nickel, and three ruble coin, 1991, silver.
In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness one issued in Russia. Two ruble coin, copper nickel, three ruble coin, silver.
Ten ruble coin, brass copper, nickel, and one hundred ruble coin, silver. In 2008, the continental hockey league named their championship trophy for Gagarin Cup.
In a 2010 space foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the hash six most popular space hero, tied with Tartrex fictional capt. James D. Kirk.
In January 2011, Armenian Airlines are maybe named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honor.
From 14 July 2010 to 14 July 2011, a copy of the statue of Gagarin from outside his former school in Ubersip has been installed at the Admiralty Archend of the Malin London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Kirk.
