Hey everybody, this is C Prompt in North Carolina for Hacker Public Radio.
I thought I'd pop on real quick and do a quick episode because a conversation came up with
a friend of mine on something and I wanted to share my thoughts on it and maybe drum
up some other episodes from other users on their opinion.
What this is about is the phrase I couldn't care less.
Is that what it is or is it I could care less.
So this is my thought process.
What I want you to do is I want you to grab a piece of paper and I want to have you grab
a writing implement, a pen or pencil or quill, whatever.
And on the piece of paper I want you to draw a line from left to right horizontally.
So we have a line going across the page.
Now at the far left end, I want you to draw a line going vertically and do the same
on the right side.
So now we have what looks like a capital I laying on its side.
So at the far left side, I want you to write at the top of it the number zero.
Now at the far right end of that line, I want you to write the number 100.
Now in the middle of that line, the horizontal line, you can make a little tiny dash vertical
dash and write 50.
So what this is going to represent is a line going from zero to 100.
Now if I care about something, then it's going to be how far toward the 100% of it is
how much I care about it.
So let's say that I'm a network administrator and there is a newfound bug in Apple's iOS.
And I have no iOS in my personal possession or on my network.
Now I probably don't care really about this bug or vulnerability inside of iOS now.
So my caring level is going to be way down toward the zero.
Now how far down toward the zero really depends on, okay maybe I have some friends that
have iOS devices and I want to pass on the information.
So maybe it's at the 10 to 20% mark, all right.
Now let's say that I want to express how much I don't care about something.
Let's say that, wow, really drawn a blank here, let's say that there's a, okay, let's say
that hypothetically that you don't care about the game baseball and the Chicago Cubs are
in the World Series now, all right.
Let's say you don't care about baseball and the Chicago Cubs are in the World Series
right now.
Your caring level is going to be at absolute zero.
Now if someone says to you, hey, the Chicago Cubs are in the World Series.
Well if your caring level is at zero then what you would respond with is I couldn't
care less, okay.
Because you could not care less, you are at absolute zero.
Now theoretically yeah, you could go, there are numbers below zero but really if you don't
care about something, you are at zero and if you want to express how much you don't
care about this situation or this topic or this idea then you are going to respond with
I couldn't care less.
Make sense?
So what are your thoughts on this?
Do you say I could care less?
For some reason that is something that is one of my pet peeves and it, for some reason
it just, it makes my ears hurt when someone responds to me with I could care less.
Oh well great, well then you care about this and so you understand my situation and what
I am telling you is something that you care about because if you could care less then
that means that your caring level is above zero and maybe below 100, okay.
So there are my thoughts.
So this is a real short, you know, five minute, six minute episode so let's see what you
got.
Thanks a lot and I hope everyone is having a fantastic evening, day, morning, afternoon.
Thanks, bye.
