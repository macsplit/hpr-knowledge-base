Hi, you're listening to Hacker Public Radio.
I'm 330 and this is Copy Fight.
Hi ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to let you in on a, I guess it's not really a secret
since it's been plastered all over the internet, but there's a way to get all of the Beatles
tracks for free, legally, online, and it doesn't involve Apple or Amazon.
A couple of weeks ago, NRK, the Norwegian Broadcasting Wing of something or other, signed a deal
with Music Rights Holder, Tono and Norway, the new deal gives NRK the right to publish
podcasts of all of its previously broadcasted radio and TV programs that contain less
than 70% music.
Podcasts containing, podcasts containing music may be up for four weeks while the podcasts
without music may stay up forever.
As a result of the deal, they can publish this thing that I can't even read, it's in Norwegian,
but it's a daily Beatles podcast that they did.
And I'll, in the show notes, I'll have a link to the RSS feed, but basically what you
have to do is suffer through a three minute story in Norwegian and then the Beatles song
in its entirety is after it.
At the time that they wrote it, which I don't have the date in front of me, they had 14 episodes
already up and they said that all 212 will be up by the end of January.
And there's a link to it for you to dig it and links to their other podcasts and stuff.
But yeah, this will, this is the only way as of right now to obtain digital copies of
any Beatles tracks.
So, go ahead and download them and have fun.
