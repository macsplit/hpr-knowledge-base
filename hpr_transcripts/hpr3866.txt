This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3866 from Monday the 29th of May 2023.
Today's show is entitled, Introducing Myself.
It is the first show by Newhost Reuno Key and is about six minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is I discovered Hacker Public Radio at Fostom 2023 and want to join the party.
Hello.
My name is Andrii Unish.
You can find myself online under Reuno Key as well.
This Romeo, Genki, uniform, November, Oscar, Dash, Chilo, India.
Sometimes without a dash of the platform does not allow it.
This is my first episode on Hacker Public Radio.
It is recorded on 8th of May 2023 using Order City.

Today I want to introduce Myself.
I'm a web developer for ten years now and recently turned into a freelancer.
My area of expertise is with front end technologies, also I also know no jazz and pison.
I taught myself these languages because my studies and mathematics did not cover them.
During my studies I switched to new Linux.
I started with Ubuntu, but discovered that I prefer rolling release distributions more.
So I jumped to Sabayon Linux, which was based on Gen2, Betzan, but pre-compiled the binary while staying convertible.
Now they decided to turn into another direction so I was looking for another home.
I tried Gecko Linux based on an open-susur for a while until they had some bad news in the press.
I'm currently using Kaizen Linux, which is based on debut and bookworm.
Speaking of, I love to read.
I have whole shelves filled with books here.
There's so much you can learn from books, even in the age of the internet.
I enjoy that they have a finite amount of content that you can work through.
I learned about Hacker Public Radio at Foster 2023.
When I mentioned that I was having an Rode NT USB microphone at home, I was encouraged to contribute to the show.
Now I have been listening to the podcast since the beginning of the year, and already heard some emergency shows.
I noticed that the hackers of the show are mainly from the United States.
I hope you welcome people from other parts of the world as well.
It took me a while to record something because I have children at home at kindergarten and school age,
and we had really sick leaves here for an extended period of time,
and starting your business as a freelancer isn't that easy.
I'm still looking for contracts, so if you know something, let me know.
I'm from Germany in Europe, a beautiful place to live,
and I bet as diverse as in the States when it comes to the landscape.
You know, we have more than Berlin and Berraria here.
I'm not quite sure which kind of content you would love to hear about.
I have the recreated topics page in front of me, and I should talk about different items.
For example, my very first smartphone ever was a Firefox OS, and I still have it,
as well as a tablet, which you couldn't buy.
I switched to Android with an app store,
when Mozilla was tentating the Firefox OS project.
I'm running on a fair phone here, which is a small Dutch manufacturer
that already managed to move the whole industry into a little more sustainable directions,
because we produce a lot of e-waste.
So I could talk about that.
Or I could talk about building things for the web.
Usually I block about those because it feels a bit more natural
to have text in front of you when you write code.
But then I saw that some episodes contain code snippets in the show notes.
So why not talking about coding?
Or I could talk about mathematics.
We don't have enough portraits about math.
My photos were on statistics and numerads, so that might be interesting.
What I would love to hear more about is music theory.
You see, I haven't learned to play an instrument in my life.
Mainly because those are expensive.
My personal taste goes more into heavy metal,
but I'm not sure whether you would call me a fan.
What does make a metalhead anyway?
But in order to improve my game development,
having some sort of music and sound effects is important.
So I was really enjoying the episode, 3, 7, 9, 2,
on really music sheets.
I learned some books on the library to learn more about it.
These subjects were discovered in deaths in my school days.
Another subject I would like to learn more about is electrolytes,
especially repairing one's computers.
Look, I'm using synch pads since years now.
I have a 825, a 2050,
which I bought at Phosdom a few years ago, currently in use.
But I also have a 8200 and a T520,
gathering dust here.
Mainly because something broke with the hardware
and I'm too afraid to create them open, so I just buy a new one.
Then there's a HP powerion standing under my desk,
waiting for repair.
And even one of those old machines from the dust array
with an original limit installed on it.
But I have no idea how to refurbish them
into a bootable state.
Do you have ideas?
I'm going to share my homepage as well as my email address
in the show notes.
I would really love to hear back from you.
I feel I already touched on different ideas today,
but looking at the time of the recording, it's rather short.
Personally, I can tune into epithodes up to 30 minutes at best.
So I will try to respect this trash of myself.
Looking forward to hear back from you and signing out.
