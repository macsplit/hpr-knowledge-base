turmoil.

Everyone, you're listening to Hacker Public Radio.
This is Klaatu and in this episode, I'm going to review a little RPG game called Dead
Earth.
A few game systems match the apathy and brutality of Dead Earth.
Now if you're a fan of Fallout, Rage, Mad Max and all things post-apocalyptic, this
game is one you have to try.
And I do mean try because surviving Dead Earth is by no means guaranteed.
Dead Earth is just that cruel as the game intro states.
Only one will mourn for your death and that is you.
Take heed.
Dead Earth is out of print and it has been for about, I don't know, 20 years.
But it was released for posterity under the GNU free documentation license.
Now that's probably not the optimal license for game materials.
It was certainly never the intent of GNU free documentation.
I don't think to serve as a game license.
But that's what they had at the time and it is therefore free to redistribute.
Now sadly, the copies that you're probably going to find floating around the internet
today are often missing one thing or another.
All the GFDL that is GNU free documentation license versions that I could locate had
no artwork because they were just, I think they were stripped PDFs probably.
And it makes sense because I highly doubt that the art has been licensed freely.
It was probably just the game rules that they licensed.
And generally these copies are missing little things here and there.
Just like, oh, we've somehow, we lost the column for the damage die in the weaponry column.
Or we forgot to print somehow the table for weight and height effect that the charts for
weight and height are missing.
There are just little bits and pieces just sort of that just didn't make it in.
So they're gone.
Compounding the issue of incomplete material is that the writing of the rulebook at its
best was arguably ineligent.
Part of that is the natural style of the game.
Dead Earth makes no pretense.
You're the scum of the dead earth and deserve to be talked down to taunted, ridiculed, and
generally prepared for a quick and miserable death.
That attitude sometimes extended from tone to grammar and spell checking, possibly not
entirely intentionally.
But then again the authors of dead earth had a lot more planned than they were able to
accomplish in the end before they had to fold everything up.
So maybe the writing would have gotten a little bit more polished eventually.
And dead earth was one of those games that kind of coexisted in printed material and with
their website presence.
So I'm not even sure how much of the printed material was considered.
It may have been very much considered a living document in spite of being dead earth.
The game's amazing though and it's a very unique or at least in my experience.
It's a unique experience.
So one thing that I've done with the dead earth, Gnu free documentation license bundle is
to instigate some critical updates to the PDF that you would need to actually play the
game, which includes restored table layouts so that the charts are readable.
Some of the PDF formatting had sort of decayed over the years due to presumably maybe changes
in fonts or rather the fonts not having been bundled into the PDF maybe and just general
shifts in the PDF format.
Again, maybe and I restored some charts that were previously missing entirely and I even
made some rule updates.
So in one case a new rule kind of it was just being, it was begging to be created.
So I mean I've included both the old traditional method, the one that's in the original text
of the book but also an alternative.
So in the original game you were told to roll 2d6 so that's two six sided die for each
skill on your character sheet.
If you rolled a critical success that would be a 12 then you gained some special benefits
to rolling on that skill later in the game but if you rolled a critical failure which
would be a two the lowest possible roll for 2d6 then you got some special disadvantages
to rolls on that skill during the game.
The problem is that there are literally 100 skills on the character sheet.
So if you were to do what the rule book told you to do whilst building a character you
are going to be rolling 2d6 100 times in a row and only marking down the twos and twelves
that you roll.
So out of 100 maybe that's I don't know.
6 times that you're actually going to be marking something down.
So you're rolling 100 times for six things of note, worthy of note and that's it.
So I just couldn't, there's no way to make that entertaining in real life.
I've tried.
I did.
I've tried it.
It's not possible.
So this free revision that I'm offering offers an alternative rule which is to roll a
d100 to get a random skill from the 100 skill list and then roll a percentage die to
decide whether you're good at it that is if you roll 51 to 100 or bad at it that is
if you roll 0 to 50 rather.
So you repeat this process for a total of 6 times and you have the average number of
skills more or less that probably would have been affected by rolling 100 times.
With some randomness thrown in to determine whether you had a net gain or loss.
It's not an exact simulation of the original process and I'm certainly open to hearing
back from any maths experts on ways to make that even better.
But in practice I do find that it achieves a close enough approximation and close enough
is the key phrase here, dead earth is is is brutal by default.
So it's not entirely unintended that this alternative does lean toward more success
than failure.
So included in my revised edition is a digital version of the character sheet.
It's a spreadsheet that I did in LibreOffice.
So this is like one of the three spreadsheets I've done in the past five years.
And it's available obviously for all platforms because it is just a spreadsheet and I'm assuming
it would probably even work in an online spreadsheet.
I have not tested it but I don't see why it wouldn't be compatible.
Technically dead earth is actually pretty easy to manage on paper.
So the digital version I wouldn't say it was necessary but it is a nice option to have.
And there are some nice little features that I implemented.
If you actually if you have a natural ability in your 100 rolls that I was just talking
about then the skill that you have a natural ability in turns green.
And if you have a natural inability to a skill then it turns red.
And there's autocalculation for your maximum load based on your weight and your height
and strength and a few other little conveniences.
And yes you can download this whole thing if you go to mixed signals.ml and do a search
for the dead earth post you'll find that there is a seven zip, a P7 zip bundle of dead
earth, the revised handbook and then a bunch of other materials and then the character
sheet as well.
And believe it or not unlike my episode on PDF creation and stuff like that this is
not a trick.
There are no embedded secret files in this download it is purely for the fun of the
game.
So if you if you want a free copy of this freely distributable RPG then go to mixed signals.ml
do a search for dead earth and you can find it.
So what's it like?
What's it like to play dead earth?
Well I don't have any sample play for you but I certainly do have lots of thoughts on
the game itself.
So let's talk mechanics.
Dead earth uses two kinds of die, a D6 for skill and damage rolls and a percentile die
which a percentile die is either a special die with double digits on it, 0, 0 through
90 and then a D10 you roll and the combination of those become your roll or just a 2D10 and
you can kind of fake it you know make it a percentile that way.
The difficult that's all you need those are the only kinds of die that you need.
It helps to have multiple multiple copies of each die not maybe not the D10s you don't
need that many D10s D6s you tend to need more than one but it's it's not there's not a
whole lot of a die that you need it's really just the D6 and the percentile.
So the difficulty of tasks during the game that are not specifically based on a skill is
set by the GM in anticipation of a percentile roll.
So there are six shades of difficulty and generally you succeed by rolling below 15 with
24 being difficult 36 improbable and 51 being improbable.
That sort of thing kind of annoys me I'll be honest because I think in a good gaming
system everything should be should be pointed in one direction that is to say you should
either always want to roll low or you should always want to roll high and in dead earth
I will admit this is not the case sometimes it is better if you roll low and in other
times it is better if you roll high.
So in a non-skill based roll you want to generally roll low below 15 otherwise if you
roll high things become impossible for you to achieve.
Now skill rolls are different skill rolls are contested rolls usually against an enemy
for skill based rolls and the skill based rolls I'm talking about the set of 100 skills
that are specifically identified by dead earth as well special skills.
If something falls within the category of one of those skills then you're doing a skill
based roll probably and in these kinds of rolls you roll as many D6 dice as you have levels
in a skill that you're rolling for.
So if you're level three in a skill then you're going to roll three D6 and so on.
So obviously as your compounding die your goal becomes to roll high rather than low unlike
the other kinds of skill checks.
Okay as I say I admit that's not my favorite thing about dead earth and it really is something
about I think older RPGs that they just hadn't they hadn't all decided yet that you know
what it would be great to standardize a crop you know within a game whether you want
to roll high or low and the problem persists today there are still rolls in some game
systems where just because of probability or whatever they've decided that's better if
you roll low on this one that's silly to me.
But anyway for instance let's say that a player is attempting to pick a lock but while
they're picking the lock they've been spotted so some some Merck is running towards them
angrily probably to to rough them up.
So I might have the player roll their Jimmy lock die that's like a Jimmy Jimmy lock means
to pick a lock.
So they would roll their Jimmy lock die against a running roll from the from the Merck running
towards them the highest roll wins.
Now that I quite like I think that there is a lot of times in in in in game systems there's
the expectation especially to new GM's there's the expectation that that sometimes the the
roll should just be you against me and and and that's quite simple to understand because
there's there's no difficulty class to set there's no there's no range of success to consult
there's no table telling you whether you need to roll below or under a certain number
it is simply take two people take the die that they that they should have in a in a skill
and they roll it and whoever wins that roll off wins that encounter.
And I think that's quite elegant I really really like that it honestly takes me time
to get used to that because I'm so used to having some kind of table or some kind of
number to equate a difficulty level to and and so it's it's funny that that the contested
role is something that I have to get used to when I switch over to dead earth.
So in cases where a task is obviously related to a skill but there's no one to roll against
for instance when a player attempts to shoot a power switch from far away maybe they want
to shoot out you know like a an alarm or something on the wall and it's it's far far down
down the mountainside in a in a compound the DMG and PHP that's what they call the dead
earth books the dead earth players handbook and the dead earth dungeon master guide I guess
are vague on how to set difficulty so in these cases I just invent a difficulty level for
the task in terms of die and then the player makes a contested role against me the GM.
So for instance if a player has 3d6 in the weapon specialty rifle that's the WS rifle skill
on the dead earth character sheet and they're attempting to shoot that that alarm or the
the power switch or whatever from you know let's say 400 meters away we'll call it.
Then I might set the difficulty to I don't know 4d6 that's 4 die per 100 meters seems
fair to me and then the highest role wins you get skill points at the start of the game when
building your character mostly determined by your character's age you use those points to gain
levels in skills you can pick 10 skill points to gain an additional die in any skill so you're
you're buying your skills with with 10 skill points now of course some skills have prerequisite
skills so getting even one die in a skill could have a greater effective cost than just 10 skill
points so you know if you if you want to be good at the investigation skill then you you have
prerequisites and it's marked on the character sheet that you have prerequisites you have to consult
the handbook to find out what they are but for for for the record it's search and reason so and if
you want to be good at intuition for instance and save this page open you need to be good at
senses and interrogate you need to have the outright lie skill and so on so and and and there are
levels of dependencies so it can become complex you you may have to trace it back a couple of
a couple of levels to find out what you need to to have in order to to get the ultimate thing that
you actually want but that's just that's how it goes and instead of gaining experience points as
you play you're rewarded with skill points so and those of course you can use to then improve your
character so let's talk combat now the combat system in debt earth is it's precise and I like to
say it's lovingly laborious but really the way I think of it is vats I mean if you're a fan of
fallout this is kind of this is the for me this is more or less the RPG version of of vats I mean
not necessarily and there's probably I know that there is actually a fallout board game I think
out there so maybe it actually approximates this better I'm not sure but that's just kind of
that's the that's the closest equation I could make for myself to to kind of understand what they're
what they're driving at it's gonna seem pretty complex at first but once you get the hang of it
once you do it it's actually quite a lot of fun so somewhat counter intuitively maybe the initiative
role the role to see who goes first is better if you roll high now it which means that you go
later so that's why it's counter intuitive and it but it makes sense if you think about it the
lowest role is going to go first and making the first move in combat necessarily betrays your
tactics and gives your opponent the opportunity to then counter move so you want to roll high which
you might sometimes think is bad although in debt earth it kind of confuses that pretty pretty
severely so you want to roll high you want to go later when you're when you're going into combat you
do not want to be the first to make a move a combat round is variable depending entirely on your
characters abilities some characters have only two moves in combat others have six another might
have ten it just depends on your character build and your progression you know the way that you've
you've leveled up at the start of a combat round the person with the lowest initiative role
declares all of their intended moves during that round so you use up all your moves you have two
moves you use them both right right away you you you announce what you're going to do you have six
moves you do the same thing then the next lowest role does the same now some actions take multiple
moves so strategy is a combination of good attacks balanced with freedom of movement all actions and
their move costs and effects are on the back of the character sheet so you kind of choose what
you want to do and you budget what you can do according to what's on your page it what's what's
there right there it's a menu it's like a little menu for you to choose players who rolled higher
than their opponent can adapt their actions to defend against attacks so your actions are never
locked in until you've actually taken them again the higher your initiative compared to your enemy
the better because you can then adapt what you thought you were going to do that round according
to what actually happens there are skills for attacks defense and evasion so you can work your
way up to being a better fighter by adding new tricks to your arsenal combat systems usually make
more sense if you experience it or observe it so I'm just going to I'll give a quick little
sort of an example so let's assume that Alice has four moves and Bob has two to keep it really
simple they're fighting a large brute mutant who has four moves selecting moves from the character
sheet the GM has the GM who is playing the brute obviously has rolled the lowest initiative so
so the brute is going to attack first so that's good that he's got a disadvantage now he decides
to have the brute do a hammer fist move on Alice now that costs three moves so he and he only has
four to spend so he's just cost he's just spent three to do a hammer fist on Alice and he
takes a jab which is just a one one move it's a little punch at Bob now unlike in dnd and similar
combat doesn't happen in six second rounds in the game world time everything's declared by each
player as an overview of their turn and then it's all kind of sorted out so this is why going
versus is is a disadvantage so now Alice knows exactly what the brute is going to do she knows
that her assailant is going to try to do a hammer fist move on her it costs the brute three moves
to do that she can see that on her character sheet so she knows exactly what she's up against
so she uses the special defend move from her combat sheet it costs whatever number of moves the
attack that you're dodging costs but she figures is probably worth it so she still has one move left
after that so she decides to do a turn which is one move in an attempt to get behind her enemy so
in other words she's looked at what the brute is going to do she knows that he that her his move
cost cost three moves so she spends three moves of her own to defend against it and then she spends
the extra one that she's got to maybe duck and cover and maybe you know do a do a roll behind him
or something like that I don't know so Bob has two moves right that's what he that's what he entered
this combat with so he decides to take his chances with the jab from his foe he'll just take that
he'll absorb it or whatever or take the damage from it and he's going to spend his two moves on
a balanced check in an attempt to trip his enemy and that's the round of combat so once it's all
declared then you go through each step of the combat and and announce how it how it actually
works out for the person so the brute is first so he takes the hammer fist then we look at Alice
and and we realize well that she's just she's defended against that successfully so that's
that's null and void so that's three moves out of the way for for this round and then we look at
as the next move next move which is jab at Bob so Alice succeeds in her turn I would say
and the jab at Bob we would we would roll for to see if that if what happens there and once that's
resolved then Bob assuming he's still up and okay can take his action which is to attempt to trip
his enemy physically trip him to to to cause him to fall onto the ground and you can he would roll
for that see if that's successful and depending on the state of things the next round begins
and all of the actions are declared again starting with fresh you know with all the moves that you
have available for each round now it can get more complex from the players perspective sometimes
because when you're declaring your action you might get thwarted by an enemy who who rolled a
higher initiative than you but if you declared that you were going to jump kick and then come down
for a pile driver but your kick didn't meet its mark because your enemy defended your change
can move to change you know to to suit to suit what you think has happened and that's again the
advantage of going later because you find out how the the your enemies move resolves before you
actually have to commit to taking the move that you declared you you were going to take so it's
really nice it's hyper-tactical it is it is very it lets you get it right in there and and throw
in and track just every punch that's being thrown and every kick that's being kicked and and every
roll on the ground to avoid a swing you know you you get right in there and it's just a dynamic and
and very kind of active combat system a lot of people complain I think about
combat systems like the D21 in D&D where a lot of times they feel like it's not very it's not
we're not really in there we're we're zooming too far out and we're kind of looking at the battle
from way too far away whereas dead earth there's no way to do that it's it is it is exactly it is
what you are doing with every party of your body and how how long it takes or how many you know moves
it takes to to meet your mark and whether it succeeds or fails it is it is very up close and
personal so it's a lot of fun and and it becomes collaborative too because everyone at the table
then has to you know you break out your scrap paper and you figure out what how everything resolves
and there's no there's no real chance of someone just sitting back and sort of spacing out while
other people are in combat you know it is a very interactive process and it it is quite nice
okay so let's talk about character creation as I've said before I love character creation
I really do it's I think it's a blast so first of all the players handbook encourages you to
gather friends and build characters together now this is something that I've never done in RPG
playing before the I think the expectation in most RPGs at least now I don't know how it was before
but now it is I shouldn't say I've never done it before but anyway the expectation I feel like
in modern RPGs is that you bring a character to the game or you show up early to build a character
with the DM but and I have actually done character creation together I guess in a way I show I did
a I did a game at a game convention which was sort of a first edition D&D clone and and so I just
brought little character sheets with all like what six stats and an equipment a gear list pretty much
was all it consisted of and so and it was a high death count game so if you died in the game you
just rolled up a new character right then and there and and kept going so it was a very fun and
highly highly dynamic and and instant kind of kind of process but that earth encourages you to
actually make the character build sort of your the the the session like that's a good get together
build characters together as a gaming session and then on your next the next time you play use the
care use the characters that you have built I think that's a cool idea and the process is pretty
is pretty clear and simple to be honest you kind of it's maybe a two or three page process in
the player's handbook it steps you through it really really clearly I'm quite I'm quite impressed
with how with how explicit it is what you put put this number into that box you know there's
not a whole lot of flipping back and forth in the book you just go through a checklist you get your
numbers you put them on your player your character sheet and then you're done so you roll the number
of D6 prescribed in the handbook for each attribute you consult the tables there in the book
you calculate the results the player's handbook steps through the whole process
um and it doesn't really talk about it too much it just tells you exactly what you need to do
it's it's not quite as clear as something like dungeon raiders or you know first edition D&D
where you're just you roll a couple of die and you're done and you're you're off to a dungeon
but it is a lot clearer than than most modern D&D or Pathfinder or really modern game systems
than I've personally experienced skill points and renown are the main currency for players
in debt earth so the renown are sort of it's a hybrid of like D&D's inspiration points
and experience points while skill points are like Pathfinder's skill ranks both help you level
up your character and probably more importantly they help you well stay alive because now you
have more skills we should talk about radiation radiation is a big deal in debt earth so you first
roll against the radiation table during your character creation or you're likely to anyway
the number of times you have to roll is determined by your character's age because it is assumed
that the older you are the more radiation you've likely encountered in your lifetime makes sense
the the age you you you determine earlier in the process by a percentile die roll
as you adventure you have to roll against the radiation table depending on where you are
in the dead earth world coastal regions it is stated in the player handbook I think or maybe the
the dungeon master guide coastal regions in lowlands tend to have more residual radiation so you
might have to roll once a week for instance other areas are less affected so you won't maybe
roll on the radiation table as much but the radiation affects vary from like literal instant
death sentences like if you roll a 20 on the the radiation table decapitation radiation blows your
head right off 10 d 10 to your head okay so I mean that's it that's a death sentence for your
character to major upgrades so if you roll 11 crafty add a d6 to your jury rig skill well that's
great that's perfect that's brilliant so there are a staggering number of of effects something like
I don't know a hundred or two hundred or six hundred is it's a lot of of radiation effects on this
table now is it fun well radiation in dead earth is harsh it is unforgiving it is detrimental it is
powerful and yes it is really really fun everybody likes to roll die that's part of the fun of the
RPG and the process of discovering just what radiation can do always makes for a memorable game
night I don't care how many times you sit down to read the dead earth handbook you don't get the
full you don't get the full picture of what radiation can do until you experience it as a character
so it's very clear in the players handbook that you your adventurers are anything but normal you
venture into unknown territory you brave radiation you become mutated you are feared by normal
people radiation isn't just a game mechanic it it has in game like social repercussions
so you will you will be changed by radiation and and it will it will alter how the world treats you
now it does take getting some used to if you're not you know if you're if you haven't played a
20 year old RPG before if you're used to building characters with complex backstories and with
these these lofty dreams and high hopes for character development dead earth is different characters
and dead earth are disposable they're simultaneously the heroes of the story and the meaningless NPCs
meandering into somebody else's background they will die you have to accept that sometimes
without the chance to fight back you have to accept that there's a realism to it I mean to some
degree right death can take you by surprise oftentimes it does there's definitely an argument
as to whether or not that level of quote unquote realism is necessary in a game which you play
for entertainment so dead earth itself it says in the players handbook that this is a game so what
I add to that is just remember that it is a game if instant permadeath doesn't appeal to you
then you can and should change the rule if that doesn't fit your playing style then just
don't do that if your character would have died during character creation and that's not pleasing to
you then just reroll it's acceptable to do that I've done it totally I've done it I didn't regret
it either I've done it and I was quite happy with it if your character dies during the game
and that's not your style you don't want your character to die you don't want to be bothered with
creating a new character then just make a new rule you can impose a penalty like okay I didn't die
but I lost all my possessions or okay I didn't die but I lost a rank in this skill or in all my skills
or maybe you've lost a limb and now that's something that you have to deal with with in game this is
one of the inherent advantages of tabletop games they're easy to reprogram so take advantage of
the flexibility if you have to because I know that a high death count may be fun for one game or
maybe fun for one group it might not be as fun for other people or it might it might just be
too inconvenient you might not want to have to build a new character maybe because it is a lot of
rolling so it's it's a it is a job to rebuild I do think that debtors character build process
especially if you've done it a couple of times it is easy enough to do at the table though so if
you're if you're okay with a hike death count then it's not the most it's not it's not impossible to
sit down and say okay you guys play ahead I will be building a character and then we'll meet up
and we'll we'll keep playing so that's totally something you can do but if you don't want to then
like I say you can just say okay well we're not I didn't die that was an alternate reality we all
had a good laugh about the absurdity of my head being blown off by radiation but that didn't
really happen so let's continue it's it's fine to do that you can just re-roll something that
would have killed your character or you can just say okay well they're unconscious now and and
they will they will come back later you know it just it certainly there's an argument as well for
yes character death should happen otherwise what do you where's the tension right where's the risk
but how often you want that to be something that can just happen out of the blue is up to you
okay so I'm saying that because I heard some people critique dead earth for for how how brutal it is
really but but I love it so anyway let's talk about setting really quick there's not a whole lot of
world building that goes on in dead earth I mean there is a little bit there's a there's like
two pages of the sort of the history of the world like how how do we get here well this is how
now the beautiful thing is I think to me dead earth doesn't really need a whole lot of lore I feel
like of all the game systems out there this is one of those that is just in our common or at least
within my bubble of reality this is kind of common consciousness stuff we all know you know just
like we all know vampire lore or we know we know zombie apocalypse stuff that's what you know we
all know the stuff when you say okay this is a post-apocalyptic wasteland or post nuclear wasteland
you know what that means if you've ever played Fallout or you've Wasteland if you've ever read
Vonnegut or Philip Kiddick or Jack Vance or you've seen Mad Max or you've seen 12 monkeys or you've
seen I am legend or whatever it is we've all been there right we've all been in this world already
and so when you are when there's when there's this world that's being built dynamically
during the game then it's pretty easy for the players to just kind of make assumptions
it's a safe place to just say okay well there's probably a burned out car somewhere can I rummage
through the boot and see if there's a crowbar things like that you can just you can make quick
assumptions like that and and let the GM roll with it as as they will so it isn't like in a fantasy
game where you're not really sure whether well what kind of fantasy world is this are we are
is there a is there a ruin are there ruins of a temple over here in the mountainside but that
be a safe assumption or is that not really a thing in this world or you know do the do the doerves
dwell underground here they more like top ciders and how do I what what assumptions can I make
for dead earth all the assumptions are valid yes you're in a post nuclear disaster fallout zone
and and and all of the assumptions that you can make are valid it's nice you have a common
language that's it that's everything I have to say about dead earth as I've as I have stated it
