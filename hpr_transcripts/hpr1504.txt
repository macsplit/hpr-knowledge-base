...
Oh.
All right, welcome, hacker public radio listeners to another episode of hacker public radio.
We're doing our, for NELF Roundup here, the night of the Northeast Linux Fest.
I'm Pokey and guess you don't recognize my voice.
Next to me here is Johnathan Native, fellow people.
Bill. Hello.
We're on the Cody Cooper mic.
What we were.
Rowan Sire.
Sarah McCouston.
Well, Collin Carmel.
Hey, sir.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, yeah, we're wrapping up NELF.
We're having our after party.
We're in, uh, Johnathan's your hotel room, I think, right?
Yes, yes.
I never knew who's the hotel room I went up in.
That's a problem.
No, that's not so, that can be a good thing.
I always asked the next morning.
It would mean something he didn't say that every weekend of the year.
It's only, it's only a problem with three or four times in a row that it's Chad.
It's, it's so, uh.
I think we lost Chad.
Yeah.
He made the hole on both ends of the hole.
Did he really?
Yeah, he said his room.
He's out.
Chad's a very good drinker.
He's done.
Well, he's good at the spread, not so good at the marathon.
Yeah.
Ah, nice.
It's pretty good.
Um, Johnathan.
Hmm.
How was it now?
Honestly, I was about to say earlier, this one by far is the best one yet.
And we probably see it every year, I imagine.
But for real, this one was by far the best.
I think we raised the bar this time.
There is once the day of the event, there was zero fires to put out.
Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful.
We had a few things, you know, just needed some quick help.
They helped out.
It was awesome.
Great speakers, great line of speakers.
Everyone, you know, just loved the event this year.
Um, there are a few little tiny nitpicky things probably.
But, you know, we had to change venue three times.
And really, this one was kind of a blessing in the sky.
So, I'm pleasantly surprised and very happy the way that I went.
Yeah, I thought the hotel...
I was pleased.
Not that I matter.
Um, but I thought the hotel was...
At least you know your place.
Thank you, Cody.
You're welcome.
Um, anybody else?
Nothing.
You're fun and anchor for reality.
We need that.
We really do need that in every situation.
Yeah.
Anybody else get anything to say about it?
I'm a first timer up in this area.
I'm six hours away.
It's my first time and I'm glad I met the Packer Public Radio guys.
Even though I listen to it pretty regularly.
It's nice to...
You'll be hooked now.
To maybe do some frequent contributions.
Just, you know, even if it's musings and three people listen to it.
It's more than zero.
Yeah.
You okay to show?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's nice.
Um, my job sometimes demands more of me.
So, uh, a weekly on the dot thing may not be nice, but that's why it's nice and interesting.
Nice.
And we didn't get a chance to talk to you today.
Did we for HDR?
I did.
Just very briefly.
Okay.
Yeah.
Um, I have to definitely check it out.
Yes.
It's a lack of...
Feels Bragg.
I listen to a lot of podcasts.
And it's definitely won, uh, along with, um, a couple of the other comedic podcasts that I like to listen to when I need to unwind.
Yeah.
Definitely really nice.
Well, Bill had to pick a Poke Slack and use some interviews because he was holding out a chair most of the day.
Yeah.
Bill was the man this year.
I, I mean, I've never tried.
I've never tried.
I was just repeating some of your questions that you asked people and they weren't there.
That's kind of weird.
Yeah.
Did you like any talks?
And you want to plug anything?
Yeah.
And those are the questions you asked me.
I thought I was special.
You're special.
I'm thrilled.
Yeah.
Because I showed up today, like, half of me.
I didn't have much sleep.
I'm very tired.
I wasn't prepared.
I just didn't...
This year's been a struggle anyway, especially lately.
And Bill picked up the Slack so...
I mean, I know, like, the first year, like, I brought all the HDR stuff.
I kind of was the guy.
This year, Bill was the guy.
I felt like I was helping NYU Bill out this year.
And Bill, thank you for that.
That was awesome.
It's a team effort.
Yeah.
It's a team effort.
Yeah.
But...
I was your team.
We are a team.
It's we.
It's we think.
Yeah.
So is this a bill interview, though?
Well, let me tell you here.
I definitely need to buy one of those.
Yeah, those are cool.
The H1.
In fact, that H1...
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
We have another one that HFAR bought.
The community just...
Oh, nice.
We're sending me money.
That's sweet.
To buy one.
And I bought one we had one today.
Once I get better at post stuff.
Because for now, Audacity's been my de facto.
And after attending that other...
The talk, um...
I definitely was a cutracter.
Really?
Was there a cutracter talk today?
Yeah.
Well...
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.
And it got me interested in that a lot.
Because it's non...
Thank you.
Non-destructive.
So...
Yep.
Uh...
So, I'm definitely checking that out.
Because I've been a long time at Dassy Person.
I learned by breaking things.
So, it's something definitely to...
You can tell me what you're thinking.
No.
There was a new nomination for Best Talk.
I want to throw doors lock into the...
Oh, nice.
Awesome.
I heard a lot of people say that Docker one was good.
So...
Oh, yeah.
That's always good in my role.
Oh, see.
It does.
It does.
Oh, yeah.
And I've waited a while to hear Mad Dog speak.
So, that was something I was real happy to see.
Yeah.
And being my first time I was glad to see him speak.
Yeah.
He knows a lot.
Totally.
He does.
He's kind of like...
I don't know.
You see the guy.
And he seems kind of...
Intimidating.
Not quite intimidating.
But...
If there's a friendly way to intimidate, that's him.
But then he gets to know a little bit.
That's really a friendly, nice guy.
I wanted to ask him about...
Why is this?
This is early years and what he was really like.
No, ask him.
No, ask him.
And I'll tell you.
That's interesting.
You can do.
Bring me age one with you.
We're going to make a show out of it.
That would be good.
Was it always cursing off people?
Yeah, right.
Because I've seen photos.
I've read from...
From 90...
From part of it.
91 to 94.
And...
He can tell me off.
People known before he exploded on the scene.
And was featured in...
Was it wired?
And...
I can't remember what year that came out.
But I still have it.
Yeah, because it was the first post.
Like, hey, I made this thing.
And he was going to like it.
He was completely high in the wired magazine.
But that was the start of the boom.
It was a lot of it.
And that's what got me interested when I read that article.
When I debuted.
But I was pretty young at that point.
And not very computer savvy until I got into high school.
Cool.
Cool.
Anybody else?
Have any thoughts?
What is this?
We're doing sticker trades again.
What's that film?
We're doing sticker trades again.
Oh, we all trade stickers.
Oh, my God.
Sometimes it will help.
Thank you.
I'll give you two of these for one of those.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll put these on my newer laptop.
Yeah.
But I've been trying...
I didn't know what anybody else had.
Recommendations when it comes to...
I know I need to tell hardwares.
Pretty good.
No.
But I went with the reason, which is opposite of system 76.
Yeah.
But my display wasn't quite happy with.
No.
But I didn't spend enough.
Oh.
I hate to hear that.
Money solving.
Yes.
I should have tried a thing pad, but I'm not a fan of the newer ones, but...
Yeah, the Lenovo's.
I do have an old one from 2003, but it is sneering its end of life.
I'm still one of those faithful.
Faithful Thinkpad users.
Oh, three.
Yes.
I guess 20 computers that are...
Don't put the control in the function in the wrong spot.
Yes, I do.
Sometimes.
You can remap that, though.
It's easier for me.
Yeah, it's easier for me.
Anybody else have anything you want to say about the conference or talks or anything?
Quite frankly, the guy who ran is kind of a prick.
Yeah.
There we go.
No, it's safe for me.
Oh, sorry, Jonathan.
It's dangerous.
I have to admit.
I was excited and I had told two weeks ago.
I'm like, I'm going to Harvard.
I'm going to Harvard.
Oh, where's this now?
Yeah, wait.
What?
I'm like, what happened?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matter of fact, let's never talk about this again.
Yeah.
It went from...
I'm going to Harvard.
I'm going to the Marriott.
I'm probably going to have this.
Maybe tomorrow is still...
I don't have to do something, but...
You do not want to drive home.
You do not want to drive home.
You do not want to drive home.
There's no security.
I do not want to drive home tonight, so.
Yes.
And I always are going to people from...
Especially from far away.
Check out the Museum of Science if you can.
I saw that.
Well, it takes a whole day, at least.
That's why I got mad when I actually went to DC.
I'm a James Bond fan.
And I rushed to that and I was disappointed.
Because that takes a whole day to go through that one.
Yeah.
The Museum of Science.
And what was the one right down the street?
Was there another planetarium?
Or something?
The Museum of Science has a planetarium at it.
There's the aquarium.
The corn.
Don't go to the corn.
Don't go to the corn.
No.
It's just the thing.
No.
You can skip the stone zoo while you're at that.
That's something's going to skip that.
I was planning on...
I have not got a chance to see the Blue Man group.
And I know they're local to...
Yeah.
...do shows here.
And I thought about that or going to a socks game.
But...
Can't go wrong.
So...
My grandfather is a massive socks fan, so it's a tough decision.
Art for baseball.
Cool.
Anybody else?
I can't wait to come back next year.
And if you're listening to this, if you haven't been to it,
and any sort of a festival before, definitely consider going
because meeting people online could cultivate these relationships,
whether it be just a front-end chat or help.
It's one thing.
But when you get to meet those same people in person,
it elevates it to an completely another level.
And you feel even more of a type of part of this community.
So...
All right.
And the other thing is you run into people you've been talking to
in IRC for.
And you don't realize this.
Yeah.
Right.
And you go, oh, I just did that with someone recently.
My friend, I knew from college.
He was arguing with me on Reddit, on Linux subreddit.
And he said, you know who this is?
And I go, no.
He goes, this is Kevin.
I went to school with him.
Okay.
And it's thanks to meet people.
And especially when they recognize you from a certain IRC
or subreddit.
Yeah.
Because there's a world outside of it.
IRC.
And...
What?
No.
I can't be.
Yeah.
Oh, me?
Jack.
That was a joke.
Because he did his talking.
He's like, I would do this with my son.
And, you know, I do miles of gaming with my son.
What?
No way!
You're the dude that does miles of gaming.
You know, I listen to that with my son.
That's awesome.
It's pretty cool.
He is a Walmart.
He is holding down a bed that might float away.
Yeah.
Right now.
What?
Let's go get a word from Chad.
If we just sum this up, he'll keep it on.
One of the really fun things for me at a conference like this,
is like, okay, flying rich is here.
Yep.
I did not know fly rich was going to be here.
But I heard him behind me and said,
that's flying rich's voice.
And I heard him say, fly rich?
He said, yeah.
That's okay.
I'm funky.
And that's really cool for me, recognizing someone by voice,
you know, before you even know what they're facing.
Yeah, I do that all the time.
Yeah.
Because...
All right, I'll sit back down.
By the way, if anybody asks,
Donathan, why I look like a hundred and eighty five pounds swimmer.
Yeah.
I can confirm this after he gives me a hundred bucks.
I can feel it down and done.
Yeah, me too, but I swim through Jell-O.
Right.
That first...
This is the first time we've had,
like in each pair after party, with females in the room.
Oh, yeah.
Would either of you like to join in until...
Hey, ladies.
Tell us you're not threatened.
Hey, hey.
All right.
There's not a good answer.
There's not a good gunpoint right now.
Tell us you willfully come, came here.
Well, very much so.
You followed nerds.
Yeah, that's about it.
Did you follow nerds?
I was going to ask, did you follow nerds here?
Or are you nerds?
Or both?
Both.
Both.
I'm going to have to go with both.
Yeah.
I'm actually really looking forward to next year.
This year, I'm very, very new to limits, like, very, very new.
So I don't really know enough to feel like I'd be able to either get anything useful
or contribute anything useful, which I think both is extremely important for me personally.
But I'm certainly looking forward to next year, I think there's...
Yeah, it's going to be quite a good one.
Is that because you think you will know more to contribute or understand more?
Or just that you'll know that people will feel more comfortable?
Well, I think I can answer all of that just by saying yes.
Okay.
And I can, I mean, encourage me if I'm wrong.
But as a new user, it is a bit intimidating.
But right now, some of the questions you have, you don't know how to articulate them yet.
Exactly.
Yes and no.
I mean, on the one hand, absolutely.
I think it's by myself.
I'd be very, very lost.
But it's a wonderful thing in that I'm not afraid of breaking it.
You should be.
Whatever.
I'll just...
But if you do, you're going to be stopped.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
That's the fun part.
That's the fun part, right?
Have you tried turning it out in Africa?
And we can't do that.
If I get hopelessly hopelessly confused and, you know, the wiki is telling me something.
Oh, that's the best part.
My story.
My story is that what I actually need to know.
I have a handy translator nearby to say, yeah, this is not a applicable situation.
This is, though, and thanks for doing the research I didn't have to.
Yeah.
That is an awesome part of the community.
Absolutely.
If I have to do something, that takes me 20 minutes or 30 minutes.
Yeah.
I realize I can help someone else.
I'll just take this up in a forum.
Yeah.
I'll do a little podcast about it.
And I'll just help someone.
Just give it back.
I haven't even really thrilled with being here so far.
Even though I've been on it since 04, it still blows me away when I can go on IRC and talk to a developer directly.
It makes me feel like extra special.
And the answer you was.
Unless you jump into the art forms and you ask the wrong question and people hammer you down.
That's true.
That will make sure I hold beers with my friends before asking you to do that.
Yeah.
Submit an S-trace and don't look back.
And the whole free community's that way.
Yeah.
Whether you have musicians or coders.
It's the best.
It's very important.
My parents used to ask me why I like Linux.
What?
Why I do what I do.
And I just go through all things like, oh, I look going in, changing this and that.
And I narrowed it down.
Everybody asked me, well, why do you use that?
And I go, one word, it's empowering.
It's empowering.
I can get in.
And even though I'm not a programmer, I can always find a breadcrumb.
Where to go.
How to find out what to do.
Jump in IRC.
Okay.
Here's my bug report.
Here's my S-trace.
Here's my logs.
What little piece am I missing?
And from that alone, I can always find out what I'm dealing with.
You're not a consumer using what's in there.
I'm in that weird middle piece of device.
You go right deep into it.
You fix whatever.
I love your tweak.
Yeah, that's the interesting thing.
Just back up.
Back up first.
Yeah.
And then try.
I'm taking ownership.
Break it in response.
I've learned more.
With Arch.
No, I've learned to keep a monthly image back up, just in case.
Broken Arch.
Broken Arch.
You're out of your mind.
You're walking the bleeding edge.
Yeah.
I got it through this out here.
I had a new Linux user, and her first distribution is actually Arch.
I know.
That's not true.
Well, that's the other one.
It's all in the rewind tape.
Well, I didn't.
Close enough.
Yeah.
But hey, just in the room.
Try to buy fire, man.
No, no, no, no.
That's a surprise.
It's a little sip onto it, and I didn't like it.
Yeah.
It was...
Nobody did Arch.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know how the hell this was going.
She skipped ahead like a whole year by mistake.
I don't like it.
I don't know.
This is nuts.
I don't know how this was popular this year on Earth.
Nobody I know likes.
I've never talked to me.
What do you think I would want to?
I can't stand it.
Everybody.
There's a lot of preconceits.

You're going to have back and down my back.
Sounds fine.
I mean, it means something.
And they were selling shirts to promote it.
It's all merchandise there.
But the shirts have like the kind of silhouette
you would see on a trucker's mud flat.
Like I said, am I a human?
Yeah.
Is when I get out of it.
And like,
I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right.
That's my grandma's house.
Right.
I wouldn't, yeah.
I wouldn't go over it all the time.
I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right. I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right. I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right. I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right. I wouldn't go over it all the time.
Right. I wouldn't go over it all the time.
In a community where we're trying, we say,
I hear all the time, people say,
we're trying to be more inclusive.
It does nothing for my hip speciality.
It's not transparent.
It doesn't work.
What? But Loki.
Do you know what I'm saying?
We're talking about what?
We're talking about it right now, aren't we?
What are we talking about?
We'll get your product up.
Yeah.
But more specifically, because of the logo.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm asking, I'm talking specifically about,
it's like a logo.
Yes, but small.
That in itself is potentially the intention it's great marketing. Yeah, no, I get that if I had if I had that orange juice with a gorilla tearing a car in half
It's the everything like what would be that gorilla what what is that in that bottle? Oh, it's orange juice. Well, I'll drink the orange juice
I can't
My point is we've had so much debate in the last couple years
Oh my god, I knew it was debate, but the misogyny and
It has isn't it right? Oh, well, that says it's a part of it a few times. Okay. It's kind of the community. Yeah, and it's not very welcoming
Or an entry-level position and someone coming in the room for the first time
Yeah, so aside from the fact that she's obviously not naked
She's got boot that could be now for feet
This this line here is clearly a boot
So
You do that. She doesn't have
Not natural
Like this and scratching in the laptop would be here somewhere just just so we're clear. Yes. Yeah, we're good expert tips
No, no
I just when I thought that was my thought was that does this or does this not send the wrong message
It's not so much. I mean the shirt alone. Okay, but attached with
That
Website and I just seem out of place a little bit
My when I first thought maybe like you know naked hack naked like the fact I
You know someone looks more like me and hey or one of each
New guy in the room your neck is
Sorry
No, I just I just was wondering if I was the only one that thought that it seemed a little more buzzword to get
Yeah, maybe and maybe there's just so much of it. I mean it was on a big rack. It was not
And as much stickers
If I didn't put my money on it, it was a clever marketing decision. Yeah, it's buzzwordy
It would just be it would want to know that was just a title was second by right but a long long with the
picture
Anybody I mean
This is nothing against any of the sponsors, but right if I walk by a
Sponsor table with a distribute it was put on by distribution like okay
They got their stickers they got their hats they got their squishy balls they got their pens
But I walk by his table. He's got both so he's got stickers and patches and hats and shirts all with this thing on it
And he's got it
Not only is the logo itself I catching but the way he has a displayed there's also I catch it where no matter where you're in the room
You it's gonna hit your eye. Yeah, be drawn over. Yeah, that's just well. It wasn't full. Oh reject
So okay, and I know what you're saying when you say it's it was
Catchy buzzwordy thing. I guess is it the kind of
Catchy-ness buzziness advertising type thing that
It seems to be the kind of thing we're trying to discourage for the past several years as a
They didn't have the silhouette of the of the chick on there. It was just hacknating. I mean all right
So the naked I think it as a metaphor for like exposing
Yes, right right
Yes, he is just not reinforced
If it were not
If we're not for the silhouette, I wouldn't be asking the question
Well, it depends if we're side-by-side with the silhouette. I probably would not ask the question if we're the only one
I might say what are we doing?
It was interesting when Mad Dog
Brought up when he was any talking about how it was quite different before with with women and Unix and Linux
But it's kind of turntables were I don't know it doesn't seem like
With a lot of this stuff coming on the reading LKML and all those controversies is that
And I don't know if it still seems like a man's world, which is not
Intention that we don't want to
Uninvite people, right
But I think you do run a danger if you're you're trying to be too careful for the sensitivity of anybody
Because because then because because because then you can potentially hinder progress. Yes, we want to be all inclusive to a sort of extent, but then it's
No, I agree. There's careful is too careful. There's a line. There needs to be a dedication of focus
But at the same time being sensitive to certain things. Okay, maybe I'm just I guess
The difference is where do you draw the line and and that's gonna be different. My knee jerk reaction was
That was across the line and I just was I guess I was wondering if I was alone with that
I thought it was on the fence
I wanted to support Paul so I bought it. Yeah, it's not a personal thing. I don't mean to detract from sorry
Yes, so the line is on the other hand, it's a kind of over the line
Culturally not just in this culture, but in the broader North American culture have come to expect we expect that we are going to be objectified
We're going to be
seen as
Sexual beings first and anything else second we expect that we expect that going into any situation
That includes this community it might be more so this can be because it is more shelter
So they don't see a lot of women now when you say
Stem no, I mean a lot of computing technology. Yeah technology. I mean it comes to play where there's this intellectual
Community where over decades. It's always been dominated or seen as dominated by
Men and any of the stems the science
Yeah, and then we actually said here's a great new job opportunity for when it is to get into programming
It so it was recognized that the hard stuff stopping and hardware real quick
You didn't introduce yourself when you when we all did you just came in what's your name? Sorry? Oh
Langley Langley, okay, Matthew Matthew. Okay. We'll have some new people join about this world though is that it is
Almost unheard of in any other business where this conversation takes place at all
You know actually
It happens
friends mine and in legal firms
Me only six percent registered pilots are
But does the Congress
The conversation
Does it happen does it happen among peers or is it happening with HR is another question? That's a good question
The one
It's more than situations
You don't have to say that
Yeah, I can't formally aware of right
So like very soon like this conversation you're not just happening here
It's happening in other fields that have traditionally been mailed on
Not because
It's more of an open discussion here
Actually
I'm glad you said it didn't mean to be a buzzkill. I bring it up
Okay before we go much further. I'm sorry for logistical reasons we have to stop the recording pretty shortly
So and I'm sorry to cut it off just was getting extraordinarily interesting to me anyway
Is can we is anybody wrap up
Things to say about North East Linux fest
North East Linux fest. Or go check it out and make sure that you well here
And here's here's an honest piece of advice. This should air within the next what 90 to 150 days
So start setting aside a little bit of money now every week or every paycheck every month however you can that will ensure you get here
It's it sounds simple. I'll do it
I've been doing it for three years. I go to every single fest
I want you because I make the money and I make the time to do it
I'm trying to get a hotel room because I got to drive home tonight
So I got to shut myself off, but there's more booze here. I see it most parties and people are are really friendly
And for Jonathan a lot of people some people were saying I mean when I went on the website and there was
Registration a couple things kind of the Facebook pages from 2013
I mean, I definitely would be interested in volunteering
Keep things up the day is as well as you give me the information
The website really could use updated. I
Would have no problem doing a new section is still no content
I make use of
Autoposts and past things over
I would love to do it. It's a lot of fun promoting that stuff and
You know tweeting out to people and
Building up Facebook stuff and and even when it comes to advertising
It's it's not a big deal for me to during an event to chip in
$25 of Facebook accurate. It's the throw some stuff out. Sure. I do that pretty out every couple times
During the year very cool. Sure
Name any means I talked to somebody who said we invested in this before
Didn't there wasn't worthwhile so I'm not gonna come back
And so it's it seems like some like more organization and promotion
Was that this year that they invested or last year?
Yeah, yeah, there were some fires to put out last year's Jonathan. I mean I would answer you know
I would be no problem answering emails all that sort of stuff and being
Point you know want to chip in yeah, I mean it's fun because when I see it happen when you go on the website or go on things
And it's like well what happened this one? I have a that and you might pick up a piece in for there
I actually did not even know was at this convention center until things changed and
It's one of those things where yeah if you have a few more manpower makes all the difference
Yeah, yeah, I also didn't know it was relocated and so I got my ticket which was in specific times
I was interested in talking to people running it at Harvard and let it move psych. Oh, nobody told me it moved
Yeah, there wasn't quite as much podcast presses. There was in years prior. Yeah, well, I don't really follow podcasts
See them because I don't have the test difficult talking
The Twitter updates helped some of the organizing face-to-face meetings then
Put it writing I can scan sure the writing but like you know an hour long podcast and the information somewhere in the middle
I don't have time for that sure. All right
You we got we got a wrap up. Well, I just
I want it. I really would like to hear a chance to speak what we got a wrap up
So I guess just thanks to everyone who's in the room for coming to the fest for coming to the after show
Certainly, this is not everyone who's at the festival to everyone who's listening
Thanks for listening. Please try to make it to
Northeast Linux fest 2015
