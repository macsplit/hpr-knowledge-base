Hello everybody, and welcome to Hacker Public Radio Community News for February 2011.
Hi everyone, my name is Kampram and this is behind the scenes look of what's been going
on in and around the Hacker Public Radio Community in the last month.
First of all, I'd like to welcome New Hose, Sporos and BioShadow, Heineberg, JBU-92, Sven,
Mark, Katarberg, Kurtnitschauer, Trickster, Parimann, D.O.D., Domi, Claudia Miranda and Doug
Farrell.
All of you are very welcome to the network and we welcome more people to join up next month.
I'd like to quickly go through the shows where we left you off, we were at 651 Community
News for last month.
Then in their first schedule slot we had the Nameless InfoSec Podcast Episode 1, where Sporos
and BioShadow teamed up to give us a cool look down on what's been going on in the world
of InfoSec.
Very interesting show, I liked it, I'm a particular fan of Paul Dacombskirtu Weekly InfoSec
Podcast, that sort of thing, and of course, Finix's Technus Weekly show, so this is a nice
introduction to the mix.
These guys have also stated that they intend to fire off their own show, and I think
in the tradition that was the InfoNomicon podcasting cabiter, this is something I think we
should be encouraging over here in HPR, having people come on, get their feet and then
spin off their own shows.
That's only good news for everybody.
The following day, we had another new host, Eisenberg, with the introduction to Black
Box Testing, and this was, it was with Cloud 4, actually, sorry, I didn't give credits
on that, and in the first lesson, finding out problems and vulnerabilities in software,
and it was a very nice look into the issue, and was a good description of the various
different terminology and stuff that you get in the field.
Then we had another new host, JBU 92, with offline file sharing and what you can do,
some interesting ways, you know, people would say potential ways for spreading viruses
and whatnot, but hey, you've got to trust, I think it's a cool thing.
And then our regular Flavu come in with reading code, the plague and reddit.com, these
are interesting, cultural, and socially, I find them very interesting.
Sven come in with what I hope nobody will ever need to use, my first steps in recovering
pictures, some of the tools he has actually used their photorec, DD Rescue, partition
magic, these are all good tools, and this stuff works, I've had to do it myself and
I hope nobody else has to, but there are plenty of shows there on the network explaining
how to go ahead and make sure that your photos are backed up, I've done a few myself, whatever
system works for you, all the better, but don't leave it too late because, you know, those
first steps are the weekend break somewhere in Paris or wherever, if it's on a hard drive
that fails, then you have been warned.
The following day we had our friend and host number one, droops, with a HPR video proposal,
loads of people seem to agree with him, he addressed all the points of concern and I think
what we're calling them, extended videos are going to be a feature of HPR in the future.
I've got two in mind myself, I've committed one and I think there's another one I want to
do as well, so yes, if you've got ideas, you don't need to be restricted by the medium,
you can enhance that by adding visuals as well.
The following day we had Mark and Kourtney with music management consoles and they missed
the missed M-player, folks, M-player, not to forget, they also missed CVLC command line
agency.
No, this was in various shows that they were lining up there or actually outside of the
realm of ordinary players, there were music management and I don't think M-player would
be, would follow them to that, but also a very good show, also interesting to hear other
people use different software.
The following day we introduced the first of our syndicated Thursdays, following on from
last week where I said we raised the problem that people weren't hearing a lot of, we're
missing the syndicated shows, we're missing the speeches, so what we've done is reserved
a schedule slot for every Thursday for to play this sort of stuff and the scheduling rules
which I'll tell you which I'll be covering later have been updated to reflect this and
they did serenity.
I love this review, it was very, very well done and I kind of am biased because I did actually
buy this for 10 pounds which is actually a lot more than 10 bucks, but yeah I guess it
falls under the 10 bucks, not only did I get for my 10 bucks, actually it was 5 pounds
I bought it in Amazon.co.uk and for under 20 bucks I got the DVDs, the entire series
of DVDs, the movie and the book and I've also sent them over to my brother also to get
him turned into a brown coat.
Then 660 argument against emulators when retro computing, yes from those of you who know
this name allschool.org we got in a show about emulators and I must say I was never
into games per se, I know a lot of my friends and stuff are into consoles but you can just
see the passion flowing through here in this show, more, more of these and you can see
by the comments that people are very interested in and are looking forward to getting more
shows.
Then we had a QUVMOH, I can never remember the abbreviation for that, we had war walking
with your smartphone, war driving, very nice little episode, nice links here on models
war talking, war walking, war driving, essentially it's moving around with a GPS making note
of open Wi-Fi's.
I guess this is more a thing in the US where people have left leave their networks open
but here at least in the Netherlands most, if not all networks are shut except for
my own which is open free and called free open Wi-Fi so if you're in the neighborhood
here feel free to use my Wi-Fi.
Then the next day we had ZOKE, our good friend and host doing the DDWRT building up the router
and firmware, very nice show, I've done this before, this is something that everybody
should do, they're really cool, in fact out of unfortunately the two routers that I did
both of them had hardware faults and they blew up so at the moment I don't have one.
But there you go, these are nice low powered options and adding in something like the wake
on land you can turn on, connect into these boxes, send a magic packet over to your server
for instance, turn your server on, have to record the show or whatever you need to do, do
whatever you need to do and then shut it down once it's finished so there's actually
major call savings here and doing something like this.
Then we had BrotherMouse with also a really interesting series, what's on your MP3 player
and if you guys are doing these series which I like to hear, can you send in your opml
file in with the show and we'll add that to the show notes so that other people can just
import the opml file which is a file standard for saving podcasts and RSS feeds, yes I've
told you before, you all know my deep dark secrets about how I like RSS and XML.
Then we had the following day was episode 13 of a little bit of Python and it could
be a 747 because all this stuff is going over on my head.
I did get a note on this that it was a bit out of date which it is of course because
we had a quite long period there where we were working playing episodes so what I've tried
to do in the introduction is say when that was first aired so that we set people's expectations
as to what how all the content are new it is but hopefully now that we've got a schedule
slot we can start most in through a lot of these episodes as well.
That's not to say that some of the information in there wasn't as valid then as it was
now so all the better.
The following show was hacking the Crap Stables on a Friday and I linked into the Crap Stable
layout and this is a cultural thing but over this side of the water Crap's means something
completely different to that in the US.
I've often seen 1950s movies where Mama needs new shoes, Mama needs new shoes and they're
betting on their Crap Stable and it was what I have no interest in gambling at all.
It was interesting for K5 to bring us that show so that we could all
learn a little bit from it and I printed off the sheet and was looking at it on the train
all very interesting stuff. The following day or the following Monday we had Brother Mouse
salvaging old Coleman lanterns and stoves. This brought back a memory to me where I was
doing some family research and my grandfather used to service these.
I never met him but my father was telling me about it and he showed me some
some you know logos and invoices and stuff from that time where he had been servicing these
stoves and stuff so brought back some happy memories for me thank you very much
and also brought some clarification as to what the hell my father was on about but I knew
again very nice show notes here by Brother Mouse with links and time frames and all the rest
of it in it and if you are not if you just download the shows there is a wealth of information
available in the show notes on the Hacker Public Radio website and then we had John in SC with a
short podcast about resources that are available in local libraries and next up was reading code
slaughterhouse 5 and Erlang another in the excellent series apologies then for the QSK
netcast 6 the origins of open source apologies for the poor audio but yeah it was in line
then we had a new host Barryman the Linux jazz musicians viewpoint and we were introduced
to Ms. Road to Linux and how being a jazz musician influenced that it was very interesting
show and I hope to hear from them more in the future then we had DOD dummy with how I found Linux
and an explanation of where his handle came from then we had the following day Claudio Miranda no
stranger to the podcast scene anyone who's familiar with the Linux basement show will know of
Claudio and anyone who's listened to the promos for the Indiana Linux festival also known
and this is an interesting series that he's starting on how to upgrade his PC starting off with
how he went about choosing the CPU then droops returns to geocaching was the next day and this is
an enhanced episode and it was um you had the show and then you had an accompanying background
video explaining what they were doing proving that they were actually there at the time
and my daughter was just in fascination it is truly a beautiful area where he lives
and we look forward to more of these types of enhanced podcasts in the future
they syndicated a tourist issue was the language frontier episode two and I'm really really
glad to see these episodes back and back in series and hopefully they will start coming
taking fast and then the last show of the month was python response to the bad apples podcast
518 in episode 518 clatu challenges him to create a podcast script of the bash script that
clatu did and it pains me to say that the easiest solution of all is to do head space
dash one and that will give you the first line of every file head space dash one asterisk actually
and that is the episodes for this month and we'll now go on to
promote bringing some news about holst 107 which brings us blue heaven this is a dramatized
science fiction short story written by lost and bronx which is available for download and this is
a very moving piece of for want of better word of theater
in a future time of spaceflight and artificial worlds they have been born in darkness
and are merely the shades of their own lost opportunities in a dumping ground for humanity's lost
and forgotten here a rat scurries under an empty box there a homeless couple sleep on their pile
of trash an artist's obsession drives him to the brink of desperation and madness in a place where
a hunter and hunted are mere frames of mind paranoia becomes like the wisdom of the ages
this february lost in bronx brings you the short form science fiction audio drama blue heaven
and I recommend you all go and listen to that because it's very very entertaining this month was
the month of fail I don't know what was going on but I was making mistakes left right and center
so I'd like to apologize to spores and bio shadow for not crediting them correctly I fixed it once
that was made known dug far out for missing the show he emailed me and I completely forgot to put
on the server Jason dad I missed his show on the roof he put it on the roof of the FTP server
and I completely missed it there and then I did promo for a poke and code cruncher and I messed up
the fact that there was two fests and then I was spamming Claudio about his episode when you're
already introduced off and I apologize to Tlatu for whatever it is that has met him abandoned HPR
it's been a whole month and a half since we'd have a show from Tlatu I don't know what's going to
happen and now on to thanking some people first of all brother mouse for his MP3 tagging utility link
in the show notes Tony Blasher for doing some research into getting Google voice to work in the US
for me code cruncher for the entries for the business card competition which are available
on the I've opened up a PCASA website and you can see all the entries over there for the HPR
logo competition more dizzy for volunteering to look into the archive that are
automating but don't be too disappointed if you if you can't get it worked out because it is
the weirdest upload system out troops for all the man love and of course troops and slick zero again
for the um flag version of the theme song yes we have the full free lossless audio codec
version of the theme song for anybody who wants to use that and like to thank David Stafford
for the constructive comments and how to improve the show on sites and pokies mom for the following
HPR promo hi HPR listeners this is pokies mom thanks to cat fallon and k5 you can now record
HPR episodes from your phone dial 206 312 5749 for USA and for the UK dial 203 432
5879 record your story and hit pound one finished and just to let you know if I can call in a show
so it can all of y'all and for mr aggro stop picking on my son in IRC or I'm calling our mother
I think you'll agree that was absolutely brilliant and of course if she can do it so can you
I will be adding some music to the back of that and that will more or less work forward be our
promo for the next uh upcoming period of time as I mentioned before I'm of updated the scheduling
rules and that now reads shows will be released based on the following rules best gives content
produced for HPR a priority while avoiding having anyone host a show repeated in any week
hosts are encouraged to release their shows on their own feeds after uploading them to HPR
they will be released on time critical schedule slots new hosts and HPR content are the first in
first outbases syndicated shows will be released on their own schedule slot following the same rules
as above and as I mentioned before we have some HPR stickers thanks very much to everybody who
was involved in producing them they are absolutely fantastic pokies especially who is distributing
them in the north america I have a wage here for anybody who would like one for europe and we have
peacher 64 down in odds is going to distribute them on the southern hemisphere for us so thank you very
much anybody else who wants them and now is the time to ask before they're all handed out at the
upcoming Linux phase they're free as in beer by the way and we're also going to be sending some
stickers out to the podcasters who promoted HPR in the past and now I also got a the following
notification from pokie several of the HPR contributors in the IRC channel have formed the beginning
of an audiobook club we'll be doing reviews which include spoilers so I was wondering if you could
announce our first audio book title in case anyone wanted to listen to it before we spoiled it on
them we're hoping this will become a regular show for HPR but we'll see how the first one
all audiobooks that we review will be free and in beer and easily available so the mario
torrentry for the listeners and participants will just be the time involved in listening to the
audio the first audio book is a short one it runs about 3.5 hours total and I can tell you
it is a very good book which will appeal to both science fiction fans and political critics alike
the book is badge of infamy by Leicester Del Rey and is read by Stephen Wilson it is available
from podobux.com the direct URL is www.podobux.com slash titles slash badge of infamy
from podobux.com my little Feldman was a doctor once he made the mistake on saving a friend's life
in violation of medical lobby rules now he's a pariah shunned by all forbidden to touch
another patient but things are more loose on Mars air not Feldman is welcomed by the colonist
even as he's hunted by the authorities but when he discovers a Martian plague may soon wipe out
humanity onto planets the authorities begin hunting him for a different reason altogether
we'll be announcing the next book at the end of our first show and just in case you didn't get that
I wanted to try out that new voice see if that is something that we're going to be able to do
anyway it's badge of honor badge of infamy sorry is a podobux there'll be a link in the show notes
and if if you want to follow along then have a listen to that before the show comes out
now some news from the admin channel HPR has been blocked by some companies because they can
filter on the word hacker so there's money well spent there however during the spam fest that
was HPR we did get listed as a source of malware because the spam links did connect to malware sites
I've was met aware of this and I've been contacting the sites that have been linked to and
each one says okay we've delisted you but we got this information from some other website
and when I mail those they say well we've delisted you for a while and but I got this information
from this website and then the trail goes on and on and on and on and on so it's very very easy
for somebody to get onto these lists but it's very very very hard to get them off
but yes it's and it's also not nice work because you put comments on the website and then
somebody else comes on this is a spam site I read it on some other website that you've already
put a comment on saying that we're not spam sites anymore however however if you do come across
these websites and you do have the option to put in yes hacker public radio is in fact a website
that is worth being part of then yeah feel free to do that on a slightly but unrelated
note I did register the domain hobby public radio which coincidentally is also a HPR and my plan
was that we would serve both domains from the same physical location on the disk that's completely
easy for Apache to do and but I have only access to C panel so I'm unable to do that from there
if anybody knows the way how to do that by configuring C panel could let me know
so this brings up another question the website is actually
yeah it's at the end of its useful life as far as yeah it's beginning to stretch the scenes with
some of the things that we wanted to do and the guy who wrote quite a lot of the CMS stuff was
troops sent me an email which basically outlines some of the changes that he wants to do or we
should do and I pretty much agree with him on every single one and they are as follows each host
should have their own folder so hacker public radio.org forward slash troops or forward slash
can fall on or forward slash whoever slicks zero and we should have a Vimeo group
for videos which I've already set up which is already set up Vimeo.com forward slash channels
forward slash HPR if you create an account over there email troops and he'll set up our email
admin hacker public radio.org we'll get that to you you would like a site redesign to make
more up to date you would like all comments and posts so that there's a rel equals no follow tag on
them he'd like to have RSS feeds in the top bar so would I each episode link should link to its
own individual page this is also something that I had mentioned before and of course there should
be some way to play the audio directly from the site each episode should have its own unique URL so
like hpr.org geocaching underscore with underscore droops for instance uh clear
whole section about how how to record a show how to contribute a show he says it's kind of hidden
I kind of agree with him and the total common viewer thing needs to link to the episode page so
that people can see the comments about their own episodes and a way to upload the episodes
not made everything yes I agree totally and we also need to the ability to add individual
customized RSS feeds so that if you come across some shows or series or a combination that you can
make your feed available for other people and share it with the community couldn't agree with
more could not agree with them more um so this begs the question do we do an off the shelf or do we
do a self build now if we do an off the shelf um so so can we do the functionality that we have
with hpr on something like wordpress or jumular or whatever so you'd need account management
podcast plugin and the ability to release on a particular schedule the ability to upload the
ability to automate it um for the ability for commons the ability and I know a lot of this stuff
exists probably doesn't exist back when troops set up the to attack or the hpr but does it exist
now so if there are wordpress or jumular people out there or some other cms system I basically don't
want to be reinventing the wheel if all this stuff is available and we can get standard off the
shelf cool things from somebody well let's do that otherwise I have been working on updating this
our own cms system and troops was the one who wrote it and he's agreed that we can open source it
and I have no problem putting my changes out either so I guess we could do that so if there
are any pre-hp programmers that want to help us out feel free to do so and and then that's
pretty much that so if you want to give me your feedback and you know what do you think how we
should go forward feel free to do so I'm kind of personally at a bit of a loss now because
some of the functionality I need requires more and more stuff that requiring more and more time
whereas I'm thinking my own website it's just a wordpress blog and you do stuff and that's done
and I don't need to think about it really on other news there has been a proposal by myself to make
troops phoenix tattoo admins so I'm hoping to hear some news back on that because I'm going to be
taking some vacation shortly and while that's not a problem I'm going to be going to no internet
land and so if we need somebody to post yours while I'm away and I'm still waiting on some
updates on the icecast server so that's about that I'd like to have a regular slot about
upcoming events in the coming month and so if there are some events that you have that are
coming up in the coming month feel free to send them in your promos your banners and stuff and
let's get them on the website as well first of all is the indianning linux fest in it's a
floss conference which is showcasing the best the community has to offer in the way of free
and open source software open hardware and free culture and we are also highlighting the best
and brightest from all the communities from the hobbyist to the professional level have a
listen to this promo
saludos and saludos this is reclaudio montalbal brother of Ricardo
if you are like me you enjoy the finest things in life like cars corinthian leather
and linux fest join indiana linux fest one of the finest linux fest as they begin their march
to freedom from the 25th to the 27th events include LPC exam cram class LPC and PSDA certification
exams fedora activity day as well as the second rupel camp in the community driven talks
plus performances by dual core shamers and lehrthand keynotes speakers include
ther's bail log of open nms and bradley and cune executive director of the software freedom
conservancy they are also still looking for volunteers and sponsors so if you are interested
go to indiana linux.org to learn more that's indiana linux.org
now that is what i call fine corinthian leather
and that was our own plodio in my friends and the indiana linux fest is on
2011 that's this year march 25th to the 27th in wine nadam indiana napalus west and it's free
to attend and open for any attendee to be a be the hobbyist or professional join us as we march
to freedom now every 50th person who signs up for the following passes the supporter pass or the
alpi ic one exam crass sessions will receive their choice of a nuke color or nargo 70 while
stocks last and there's a link in the show notes to that prize now let me just say here folks
there are offering for one hundred dollars the ability to do an alpi ic exam cram session
now i advise any of you to go to cisco.org for sash training or something like that
red hat for sash training suza for sash training or novella i guess for sash training
michael for sash training just compare the prices for a professional qualification
and you will see that one hundred dollars is very very very very reasonable to making
attempt at the alpi ic one exam you have enough time to cram in enough sessions to go and pass
that exam on that day so if you're in that area it's a hundred bucks go down sit the exam even
if you fail it you get the experience of what it's going to be like sit and doing another exam believe
me that is cheap cheap cheap and the alpi ic is very very well respected when it comes to when it
comes to hiring people so there you go words of information and just as i've been editing the show
lord dragon blueth from the indiana linux fest has asked that if anybody wants to
do a hpr booth at the indiana linux fest they can do so if you want to help out
just fire off an email here to admin at hackupublicradio.org and we'll put you in touch
we'll set you up on some stickers and whatever else we need to do to get you up and running
now we are going to be going to the gnu norteast gnu linux fest on saturday april the second
2011 in munchester massachusetts i had to look up what m a meant and there's more information
a link to the email trail from the hpr mailing list in there so if you go to
hpr hackupublicradio.org for such mail list you can join up onto the mail list and join
the discussions about there and we're also going to the norteast linux fest

they business cards we can have up to a hundred different designs on the front of the cards and
these are going to be printed in europe and they're going to be also probably be printed in the
state so we'll have two runs so there are more or less guarantee to have every entry printed up
there and i still have loads of books to give away anyway that's it for this month i'm not going to do
the sponsor spam sponsors because to be honest i'm after the month i've had trying to
