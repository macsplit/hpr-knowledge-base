Hello everybody my name is Kenzo and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio Community
News for September 2011. First of all I'd like to welcome the new host to our network
as we always do at the top of the show and we had three new hosts this month, Okun D.K.
Tracy Holtz also known as Holster and Joe Wacomara. First of all let me thank you very
much for coming stepping up to the plate and recording some shows more about that later on.
Let's start with a quick roundup of the shows for last month. Episode 206 was Hacker
Community News for the previous month and we followed that with a show from Platoon on
Mara DNS, one of his series on networking where he introduces you to setting up some simple
networking in the house. The following day we had Brom with an interview from Jansi Smith
and I'd like to thank Brom for providing the complete transcription of the show in the show notes.
Excellent thank you very much. The following day was syndicated Thursday and this week we took
a talk to me episode from Duke Geek he suggested that we play it and it's a talk to me number 28
which is about segmented downloading and just as a little bit of feedback on that episode the
reason that ISP's hate bit torrent is because it uses it's not as efficient internally on the local
network and their own networks as something like a news group is when you take a feed from a news
group is a sort of hierarchical structure that responds to the network but they really hate
bit torrent because it goes outside of their network and every time you go outside of their
network it costs them money and if you go to a server the other side of the world it really
really costs them money so this is why they love news servers and they hate bit torrent.
The following day we had Joe with his first show introducing himself recorded in the car and he
mentioned that he was thinking of doing a arch install show and we hope that he does some feedback
in the comments section which asked him to do a show on that. The following day was a show from
Thistleweb and I'd like to apologize to Thistleweb and Tlatu and basically everybody involved in
Corba2 for not getting the show out when they thought it was out it was scheduled and they asked
me not to schedule us and then they said okay go ahead and schedule again and I had simply
taken it out of the queue so apologies for that they have essentially a free culture torrent
tracker and CMS which they if you want more information on that you can go to unseenstudio.co.uk
forward slash tracker that's unseenstudio.co.uk forward slash tracker and you'll find some interesting
information there on posting bit torrent to good use. The next show on our list was
show called in by mr. Gadgets our stalwart on the network here and he was questioning whether
they you know are you a paid control and he gives some examples of that and sort of
modulate the water for a lot of people there are some interesting feedback in the comments section
by Tlatu who feels that they are all paid controls but go read those comments yourself if you're
want to know more information now you can subscribe to the comments or how you can subscribe to
the org and our speaks feed feel free to click on the syndication link in the navigation menu on
hacker public radio website the following day was episode 813 recorded by myself it was an
interview with ruby gem about bar camp blackpool and that's coming up on the 15th of october and
they were looking for some people who maybe might be able to come along and participate and perhaps
engage in some of the good value sponsorship that they have available more information in the show
notes about that then we had the nightcast episode 54 on syndicated Thursday setting up
an amaii server I want to thank and at lord for sending this in I haven't actually set up a
man in myself but it seems like a nice way to set up a home automation home media server if you
were into that sort of thing so feel free to give that a shout the following day um well sorry the
following yes the following day was of another mix up in scheduling by an interview that I did
with chris finley at org camp about software freedom date on d which is on 2011 and I just
cut it out the day before software freedom day apologies to chris there for antisoble before
the scheduling mix ups and I just will be talking more about that later on but the episode was about
software freedom day in d and actually the audio wasn't too bad considering that we recorded
it outside the train station in front of a taxi rank in at us org camp then we had the first in
what I hope will be a very productive series from tracy holes though you'll know from the podnott's
network holster um he has started a show series called modern survivalism and it's pretty much
practical day-to-day tips on um you know how we can make use of the resources around us I don't know
if a lot of you are aware but everything you buy in the stores is shipped there on a just in time
policy so you know the ship it so that it will arrive just on the day and everything is scheduled
so it's kind of a big house it cards really so there's no buffer at all in the system
if anything goes wrong then um then there will be shortages of particular products
that's not to say I'm an alarmist or anything but you can do something about that by listening to
the uh to this episode and um taking some practical tips nothing too soon nothing that's going
to cause you any hardship or nothing too serious so let's uh look forward to that
then the following day we had a con decay the first show on how to um install uh windows
from a USB disk now of course it wasn't just windows he was um they he was discussing other
operation systems as well but this was a good example um on how you would um
add windows to the mix so a very very useful episode the next day we had
our very good friend and hbr admin pogey with an episode on how to use the sons of clip for
podcasting he had replaced the standard firmware with the rock packs firmware and was uh using it
interestingly cold crunchy who paid a visit uh to Amsterdam was over here for a cup of tea coffee
actually um was talking about how she used the sons of clip for um podcasting as well and she
was able to cut down a background noise by holding the uh earbud um where the earbuds join
the the jack that goes into the sons of clip holds onto that rather than the sons of clip itself
got rid of some background noise so the next day we had uh robin gattelings excellent excellent year
episode on editing the podcast and it is on my to do list to add all of these to um a how to
podcast section on the website the next day again clad to setting up a web server and my SQL server
making it sound very easy and of course it is quite easy so um that is a quite nice series there
a few people have uh deep deep has given some uh responses back in there to some of the comments
so check out the comments in the show notes for uh for more information on that a dial in episode
from mr gadgets um the episode getting uh the most comments of any show this month and it was
why android tablets suck um ranging from the worst review i've ever heard to the best review i've
ever heard so uh have a have a read of the show notes um mr gadgets has quite a lot of experience
on the um on android tablets so uh well worth your while both listening to the show notes
and reading the comments on this episode before you dive deep into the world of android tablets
one tip i will give you is that you would be well advised to try out your android tablet before you
um before you make a purchase the next day we had Vivian Aparkas with an interview from alcamp
and it was about the gift gaff community phone project and it was a real pity that i
didn't hear about this prior to going to the uk i would have been able to arrange a sim card
seems like a very interesting way to do a business but the sonica limon you might say well
it's uh getting the community to do your work for you but it seems to be um it seems to be
quite a good approach then uh following day we had episode two three where clatu talks to Trevor
a programmer from python's g stringer backend again a very interesting show from clatu and he
seems to be able to uh pick up interesting interviews the entire time then uh robin gattling again
with full circle podcast content edited for hacker public radio about the open tech conference
2011 polygram of fosbox um and this is a organ non-profit organization supporting digital
inclusion and helping other non-profits towards lower cost ITC systems with a more flexible
and lower environmental impact so there's uh link in the show notes to that episode to
fosbox.org.uk and you can get more information about them even if you're not in the uk
um they provide a lot of information on the site that's uh well worth reading
and the last episode of the month was jimmy sharp interview at x.org developer conference xdc
2011 by marcos and this is the first in a series of episodes uh from that um from that show um
quite uh quite an interesting episode actually didn't think i was going to be as interested
in something uh so low level as the x system and the x protocol c binding knowledge the xcb
but as with quite a lot of the things on hpr you don't know you're interested in in the month
until you hear an excellent interview just like this and i'd also like to thank thank marcos for
doing all the encoding and the show notes hidden html and doing the id3 tags and the whole
kicking kibble saves a lot of work actually so great thank you very much and thank you very much to
all our hosts um we uh we have never had as many shows in the queue as we have at the moment
boss um i'm and of course i'm happy with that if i'm looking here at hacka public radio.org
forward slash calendar.php you'll see the moving schedule of shows as they're coming up
and we have now shows stretching out to the last show that's scheduled is html community news
for the first of first monday of january 2012 so quite happy about that but because of the
schedule rules we have quite a lot of free slots and they're still as you can see if you look at
the bottom it currently says there are 31 shows in the queue and 34 free slots so if you have not
as yet done your one show for hacka public radio then it's time to start recording that show and
send it in for this year so your one show you've you've had a quite a lot of shows this year and
uh already over 200 shows and so now we would like to to hear the remainder your contribution
to hacka public radio in the form of a show and if you could send that in email adman at hacka
public radio.org we'll send you all the information that you need to get yourself added to that queue
thank you uh speaking about the queue coming up we have um i mentioned that um i'm quite happy
to have the shows in but as it turns out the shows that have been contributed are largely from
three contributors clatu mostly with quite a lot of interviews marcoes and myself with interviews
from all f and marcoes are from the x developer conference so while it's a healthy state of affairs
it is not sustainable in our current form unless people send in shows we ask for one show a year
ideally we would like um people to send in shows more regularly than that but at the moment
i'll be giving a breakdown later on uh in december show at breakdown of the year at hpr
and uh the way i see it now is the vast majority of shows uh and two higher
percentage are contributed by clatu not to say that i don't like the shows it's absolutely great
i appreciate the shows and as he says himself he would like to see the day where um hpr is self
sustainable but i don't think we're there yet so um i'm going to continue stressing and asking people
i really need shows coming in it's really great to have a full queue where um they
schedule rules have been put to the test for the first time ever up until now it's been pretty
obvious what's going to be scheduled if you have only one show in the queue well then that's what's
going to get scheduled so keep sending in the shows current harp on and off about it um after my
little mix up with chris finnelly and this web which was um do you also largely to the fact that
we have a new outro and a lot of the shows needed to be reedited and i needed to apply a lot of
the scheduling rules which i've really haven't had to do uh before i'm just going to read you an
email sent to the hpr mail list if you're not on the hpr mail list please join information is on
the website now you can do that anyway it goes uh and i called from email along with the scheduling
rules as a heck of public radio at our farmer slash counter that php there is a line that says while
avoiding having anyone host our series repeated in a week the idea of this was to allow someone
uploading an entire series in mongo and us having to schedule it so this has worked out well
so that the queue is full and the host still gets their series played fairly often boss
after an event like augamp and de anolinix fest or linux fest or aleph or etc we tend to get a
load of shows at once that fall outside the traditional concept of a series um some of these
shows have the feel of the fest and go stale after some time so the question is should we schedule
these according to the same rules meaning that there is no more than one a week or should we
open the floodgates and have a few weeks dedicated to posts and interviews and i asked people to
discuss and thankfully they did um a lot of the discussions came down on their fact that we should
we should release the shows as soon as possible um that we uh we should open the floodgates
we should release the timely ones with a higher time factors you know that are have a
sell-by date as soon as possible and essentially the answer came to me at least to me i don't know
about the rest of you but um that's what i that's the purpose of this this podcast every month is
so that those of you who maybe aren't on the way uh may list or have not been involved in
discussions at least become aware of the discussions and can send an email to the list with your
opinion but basically the way i see it is if that somebody is going to show which is great um and
we will be putting also together uh how to represent a hpr as a show you know clatu has some um
shows episode in the queue about that so what if you're going to show what we can do is we can
promote that by interviewing the organizers beforehand which we've already done
we can organize the show pack which i want to talk to you about later on
we can make sure that you have a table and all the business cards stickers um they banner
and with a little explanation of how you can what you need to do with the show and then after the show
when we're doing that we can also schedule a block of time immediately after the show or however
long if you want to leave a week after the show so that you have time for editing we can do that
as well so something like five days of all f interviews five days of all camp interviews after
all camp five days of whatever conference after whatever conference so that seems to that will
fit in well with the um with the schedule rules which state time critical shows you go first schedule
shows um where we have scheduled a regular slot and a new host and then on the first and first
out basis so in actual fact we wouldn't need to change anything uh the schedule rules will
apply and uh the important reason for that is i want um this system to be fair and be seen to
be fair so you know if somebody is going to a show you're going to know beforehand so we'll have
plenty of time to schedule out the slots so that anyone seeing their shows going in afterwards
will um well know why and yeah all should be good speaking of shows that are coming up
they're Derby Khan from Lewisville Kentucky it's going to be on from September the 30th to
october the second which will mean it's over now but hpr will be at that show um other things
that were happening with there's going to be a hpr roundtable freeknik and hey that is for
information on when that is on you can find that on the website it will be held
at as it clicks um freeknik 15 will be November the 4th to the 6th 2011 in days in stadium in
Nashville at Tennessee very good very good very good and if you have more shows that are coming
up i'd appreciate it if people will go to those representing hpr and you don't need any special
special as ambassadorial status but we can of course assign you that hpr ambassadors if you wish
and it's a great way for people to get to know hpr so that they can subscribe to it and enjoy
the excellent shows that are on here but more importantly it's a great way to get contributors in
and that's what we need we need people to come in and contribute to hpr providing us with shows
other things that happened released uh got some feedback from our um had the open source
accessibility expert mr. johnson nadu about the augmented podcast and i look forward to
doing some more of those including some of his tips about um spelling out the links not just saying
them we had um in the last show we mentioned that there was a text file available where you could
read out the text associated with the outro so that we could mix and match them into a multicultural
best embodying the spirit of what hpr is many people from many different nations and cultures
contributing to a open source network so we have contributions from carbone to
polkae and manon so far so look forward to hearing your contribution then we had a continued
discussion on the hpr theme music and i was delighted to hear that um polkae used that in one
the outros in one of his episodes um you can use it or you can not use it entirely up to you um
and then we had one other thing which was the that code cruncher was over to visit here in Amsterdam
and she called around to the house and we had a nice time drinking coffee and talking about hpr
and some of the things we'd like to do in the upcoming time so that's it that's the end of
this month's episode uh just one thing i saw tagged as hpr in my newsfeed was hpr boot at the
Ohio lynx fest where uh somebody with devil thorns was talking to a strange almost alien creature
with blue hair at what purports to be the haka public radio booth at Ohio lynx fest
yes if you want to see what that latu looks like in real life then uh you're going to have to chase
down that video and with that thank you very much for listening to my ongoing rant and i look forward
to hearing your show coming on the cue sometime in the future and remember that as always you can
tune in tomorrow and hear another excellent episode on hacker public radio
