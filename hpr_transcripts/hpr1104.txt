Hello, hello and welcome to Toxjam episode 15, now I do realise that it has been a awfully
big gap in between 14 and 15 and for this I do apologise, but I have a big, what
person to blame is that big yellow thing in the sky. Yes, sun visited the island of Lewis way
back then in June and hasn't really left until just late last week, so that has been two and
a half months, almost three months of wall to wall sunshine, so in all honesty that has
kept me out of my virtual life and I've probably done a lot more than my real life, I've been enjoying
the sun, but winter's approaching again, so you know we don't tend to do the middle ones, we don't
have a spring here, we don't have an autumn here, we get summer, winter, so we're back to winter
here, so as I speak now it's blowing a gale outside and it is pulling rain, so Toxjam is back,
I don't want to call that new season, I'm not going to go down that route, but the holidays over
the rains back on, so that means I'm back in front of the PC, and hopefully we'll have a show that
you will enjoy today, now so in the coming up we have got a look, we take a look at Lubant too
and we have a also right type which is our processor, we look at a wee simple app that's great
called Radio 3 and on the mobile we take a look at the Orweb browser, then let's take a
look at what is out this week and what is our interest of course to the Toxjam listeners,
right then, so looking at what's out, we have got Tiny Core Linux, now this is 4.6 has been released
and for those who don't know Tiny Core is an absolutely literally tiny distribution, yes,
you're going to list this right 12 megabytes, right, there are just throws that are bigger than
that in gigabytes, but we'll not go there, this is not going to give you obviously the full unity
desktop with all your favorite normal apps, but you will actually be surprised if you ever load
up Tiny Core, just how much it can do for such a small amount of space, so 12 meg you can of course
opt for the Core Plus which is a staggering 65 megabytes, but that's been released,
we also have got Waterways and this is R6 and this is a new Buntu-based distribution
and it's got, it has LXDE as a desktop environment and it's designed for low power and older
computers, so if you want to go and check that out, we have got Zorn OS 6.1 and this is called
a light and again this is a new Buntu-based distribution on the LXDE desktop, seems to be getting
a theme here, I didn't do this deliberately honestly, we have got saline, we reviewed saline a
while back and if anyone is hasn't used it, it's a Debian based distro and it comes by default
XFCE, but it's one of those things that just works, everything's there, all of your drivers are
there, if you want to do a wee bit like mappers, MP3s etc, play straight out of the box,
flashes included, javas included all those things, so if you haven't tried it, I would recommend
giving it to anybody who's a newbie, maybe obviously don't just go hand in the disk, you might
have to install it for them, but I would have no problem installing it and then maybe leaving it
with minimal input, it's very easy to use and like I said, nice distro, it does build on Debian
stable, I think it is, so I tend to find that stuff, so wee bit too stable for my liking, but
that's easy enough to change, and the final one that caught my this week is Manuaro Linux 0.8,
now Manuaro and this for a change is not there, it's not either Ubuntu or Debian based, but this
is an arch Linux based distro, and this features the XFCE desktop, so if you fancy maybe trying
it arch but don't really want to build it, then I recommend taking a wee look, and oh one that
I've just noticed, and I almost missed this one, PC Linux OS, 2012 0.08 has been released, now that
I think it's been quite a while since I've seen that distro release from the PC Linux OS crew,
not a distribution I've ever used much, but I've heard a lot of people talk about it,
it's, I think what puts me off it is, it doesn't come in 64 bit, I think as far as I remember,
it's only 32 bits, it comes KDE desktop by default, or at least it did, and it's built on
Mandriva, so yeah if you want to go out and we check that out, like I said links to all these
out in the show notes, now before we go and take a slightly more in-depth look at Ubuntu,
let's give a wee bit of music because it's been quite a while, so this is the sound statues with
give it up.
Still in my new phone, yeah, what I said I do to you,
If you try to turn away, well there was never going back from what you did then, from what you and I were
Cause your love's in pieces, it will never be this way again
Cause I want you, but I need to hear you now, there's no forgiveness
What do you do, when I love you and I can't see why, there's no forgiveness
Come and do your mind, please don't forget what I turn to you
When I do it your way, cause I know how you want it cruel
But still you believe it's nothing you and I were
Cause your love's in pieces, it will never be this way again
So give it up, give up, give it up to me
Maybe then you'll see I want you getting with me
Since you've gone from my life, well since you've gone I'm alright
So I think I'll be time with not my way of view
So give it up, give up, give it up to me
Maybe then you'll see I want you getting with me
Since you've gone from my life, well since you've gone I'm alright
So I think I'll be time with not my way of view
So I want you, but I need to hear you now, there's no forgiveness
What do you do, when I love you and I can't see why, there's no forgiveness
Oh, could you feel this way again
So give it up, give up, give it up to me
Give it up, give up, give it up to me
Give it up, give up, give it up to me
Give it up, give it up to me
And that was sound statues there
And if you like them, go check them out, they're on Jemento
I think all of the tracks tonight are one, which are pre-war new, but they're from Jemento
So if you like any of them, head over there, links for specific tracks, as always, will be in the show notes
Now then, for our distro, this is probably one that initially I probably wouldn't have said
would have been an ideal tux jam thing, but recently on the holidays
I was away at somebody's house and they had a very, very old computer
However, both of this couple, they were in their 70s, they didn't want to actually have anything, buy anything else
So really, I was kind of left with this thing that had not too much power on the tool
In fact, it was very, very slow
It was, I think it was 800 megahertz, it had 250, 256MB of RAM
So we're talking, these things are really, really slow, and certainly that 800 megahertz is single processor
It was not dual core, and then like that
So, this left me with that challenge
Now, they had been using Windows XP, and they were sick of it
They had constant problems with it, it was updating, and it was actually just way too much for what the machine could really handle
Because you were switching it on, and I kid you not, 45 minutes, it took to stop looting up everything
And he said, can you do anything with it? And I was saying yes, but it means repeating a whole new system on tuxes
I don't care, just try anything
And the problem was I had one day, they're not one day to install, one day to install the system
And then show them both how this system worked, and give me sure they were comfortable with it
Realistically, I had to have this done quickly, so initially I know a lot, you might be thinking well, for something that I told,
You know, build up an arch system, build up a gen 2 system, build up a devian system, yeah, I could have done all that
But that would have taken quite a lot of time, and I had to spend the majority of my time showing them how to use this
Because they struggled with Windows XP, so I was thinking I don't know how they're going to take to Linux in general at all
So it was purely a gamble, so I tried, first of all, Zuban, do you want to check the stats and note that wasn't going to happen
So I thought, well, I'd like to keep them on a new bundle derivative, just purely for easy mistakes
Then there's plenty of support, and the community if I ever need to ask a question
Also, pretty much everything's done for you, everything's there for you with most of the Ubuntu distros
So I thought, wait, I've never even tried LXDE, Fireless Lubuntu, but I'll give Lubuntu a try
And to be honest, I was actually quite impressed with it, I did not realise quite how lightweight it was
It seemed to run quite well, okay, it's not blissfully fast, you're not all of a sudden turned this ancient PC into a quad-core 3GHz machine
Don't give me wrong, it still was slow to me, but the difference between that and Windows XP was phenomenal
It started up quickly, there was a bit of, I didn't know it was a bit of a delay, there was a delay with just when you started things, took a few seconds to load
Maybe that's just because I'm used to my system, I don't know
But first impressions was, it was very nice, a very clean desktop, I really did like it
It almost kind of reminds me of a slight, kind of watered-down version of the GNOME 2 desktop
I can't complain at all, it was very nice, as I said, very light to it, I didn't actually realise quite how little came with Lubuntu
And maybe that's an LXDE thing, but as far as native apps go, there was Silpheed, which is an email client
And it's actually very simple to use, we set that up and now, like I said, bit in mind, this is non-computer users in their 70s
So this really was a challenge for me that I was really going into the unknown here
Silpheed was incredibly easy to use, very easy to set up, they were happy with that
Chromium was the default web browser, not a problem for most systems, however, I found it was a bit sluggish on an older system
And so I tried oddly enough, I tried Meduri, which I thought great, this is going to be really, really quick, because it's a nice wee light browser
Meduri had several problems, mainly short display and web pages, there was big chunks missing
And I'm not talking about pictures, I'm talking about text, it would just disappear, if you refresh the page
Sometimes that would bring it on, but I thought, oh, this isn't really very acceptable
So in the end, I did Chromium and I tried Firefox and I tried C-Monkey
And thankfully, they went for C-Monkey in the end because it was probably proved the fastest
Actually, surprisingly enough, Firefox on the old system was much faster than Chromium, Chromium really was slow
But there was not enough of a lot else with this though
You didn't have an instant messenger, you didn't have a micro-blog in client, okay, fair enough, they're not going to use that
But just thinking for you, for the average Linux user, I would say these things might well be, I would have said standard
As far as graphics went, we had a graphic empty paint graphic editor and a simple scan, that's it
Office, well, you had Abyward, a numeric was supplied for your needs there
You had Osmo, which is a personal organizer and document viewers for just viewing things like PDFs
Now, audacious came with it installed, along with no main player, which I was kind of surprised both of them were there
And now let me think, was it other things?
I should really shoot up my notes in front of me, this is terrible, I have no excuse for this
But there really wasn't an awful lot, that was one thing, I really did find quite surprising
It was just how bearless system is, so in all honesty, although I wanted the likes of R-Shoodov
I installed a Debian system from scratch, this practically did it for me, but it actually did a lot of the work for me
So I was really quite pleased with that
It had LX Terminal, Leafpad was the default text editor, the file manager was PC Man FM
No, I was one thing I was quite pleased at was that in PC Man FM, the last time I reviewed this on text jam
One problem I said was that it didn't show up partitions, well did not have an issue at this time, partitions were showing up without me going to look for them
So that really has improved it
Obviously with the likes of PC Man FM, it does have a limited amount of features
I'd like to see maybe add a few more, but at the end of the day it is supposed to be, it's just what it is, it's a lightweight file manager
If you want something with a bit more features, then there is Nautilus, or if you want to try Dolphin, you can
Or as my personal favourite Thunar, but there's plenty to try
No, then what else do we have? Well, not an awful lot, as I said
The one thing I was quite surprised at was we only went to Derivative
It had an update manager, that didn't surprise me at all, and this came with synaptic as well installed
But it had an update manager, but there seemed to be no easy way of setting it up sort of checked for updates all the time
Nautilus likes to be bumped into what it says, you've got so many updates, would you like to install them?
So in the end what I had to do was I just put a shortcut on the desktop for them, and just said right, double click on this, maybe once a week
Update it, and your computer should be running a bit better, rather than just never updating the thing at all
So that was okay, that was a workaround
I was glad to see Synaptic on there, they had their own version of the Lubuntu software centre
So I was quite pleased that I saw that so brilliant, we can install stuff, no bother
Now, I did actually have problems with this, on their version, the 32-bit version
I had problems in that, the only thing that would show up on the Lubuntu software centre was the installed applications
Couldn't seem to, I could uninstall from there, but I couldn't seem to search for anything at all
Just kept on giving me a zero result
If I went into the directories and categories, all I would get was the stuff that was already on the computer
So I found that odd, but this was only on the 32-bit version
When I tried the 64-bit version, I had no such problems, I had plenty of stuff there
And well, it was behaving as I would expect
Now, as far as proprietary drivers go, being typical with the Ubuntu, you can go to additional drivers
And install the Nvidia X8 Rack cards themselves, a drivers themselves for your cards
And I must admit, it runs smoothly
I know people do have issues with them
Personally, I don't have a problem, I do install them purely because I am a gamer
And I like a full 3D, not a watered-down version, which is so far, I seem to get
If there was a brilliant alternative, I would happily use it
But right now, for me, newvo driver, it just simply does not work that well
As far as stuff installed at the box goes, well, not an awful lot came by default
But when you install the Lubuntu restricted extras, you get your MP3 playback capabilities, your Java and Flash etc
And things seem to work fairly well
So if anybody is thinking about a system for an older machine and you don't have time to load up and build us a debut system or a gen2 system or anything like that
Then I would probably recommend you try at Lubuntu
Because like I said, I can't fault it too much
If you're wanting a system where everything's installed and it just works and everything's there for you in the box
I'd say probably stay away because you do have to install a fear, but it comes with very limited SATA tools
But at the same time, I said, might you just do what you want, so give it a check out
Now, I think it's a time for a wee bit more music
And this one is another one from Jemendo, a large club say, and this is promise
And this one is another one from Jemendo, a large club say, might you just do what you want, so give it a check out
And this one is another one from Jemendo, a large club say, might you just do what you want, so give it a check out

You will gain
Hold me in your arms tonight
I'll be staying by your side
I'll be staying by your side
Now then, one thing just occurred to me while I was listening to that tune there
I didn't actually say how the actual couple got on
Well, to be honest, this was a real one in the eye for the Fud campaign
Or you say Linux is difficult to use or Linux is only for geeks
Because the couple actually were really impressed
The only thing that does slightly worry me is they kept on seeing that
They were so impressed they were going to tell their friends who had computers
So I'm worried the next macovers that I'm going to have to end up taking a
blue bun to disc with me and end up probably writing a small manual or tutorial or something
So yeah, so it definitely was not something that was difficult for them
This was not even a computer-related couple
I mean, really, one of them could not even browse at the start of the day
The other one could browse and check emails but couldn't type
Should them all that, those kind of things
And like I said, brilliant
It was so hard-worming just to actually see that
Because you hear so much from the anti Linux campaigners that it's difficult to use
It's not difficult to use
At the end of the day, Windows is only used because it comes installed
And I bet you if you gave the average Joe on the street a disc will windows and a blank computer
Most of them probably wouldn't have that much of a clue how to do it
Or would they be in be that confident?
No, I seriously doubt it
So if people are given a working system and it's put in front of them
It just shows you that you do not need to be a geek
So like I said, one in the eye for the Microsoft Brigade and the crap of fanboys
But I don't know, back onto this now
The next thing I found, I found this, it's right type
And it's a word processor
A very basic word processor, I must admit
I can't remember how I came across this but I gave it wasn't difficult to install
When I did find it, in fact, it was in the Ubuntu Repos
And I've installed it through the Ubuntu software center
And it's a very, very simplistic word document
Sorry, word processing document writer
So we've got really not enough of a lot
It opens up nice, light, nice blue border
And the emblems are pretty basic
I'll give you, this is now, this is with me having all the tools on
You've got open, save, save as, print, bold, italic
Underline, left align, center align, highlight
Highlight mode, font size, font
And speak text and stop
Now, I have to admit, I did try the speak text and it never once worked for me
So I tried a few different things but I didn't go into it in any depth
Now, when you actually start typing anything
It actually comes up with a whole, it looks like there's the windows too small
There's a big area at the side on your right hand side that's just been left
Words start appearing there, a wee bit like predictive text
So you can start typing and it tries to kind of predict what you've got
And it gives you a whole list of options
It's quite nice in that respect
And then, if you actually misspell something
You don't have to right click on it
It tells you it's got a thing the same way as most other word processing do
It gives you a red line underneath it
And it tells you straight away, it's lists of options
It also has got...
Oh my, my tongue's in a twist here
What do you call it?
A punctuation checker
Yeah, yeah, had a senior moment there
It also has a punctuation checker
And what I quite liked about this is that when you actually right click on it
It tells you, they actually think, no, not in some fancy jargon
It's in proper English, so if you type in the first word of a sentence
And it's not going to capital later
You right click and it will actually say the words
The first letter of a sentence should be a capital
This makes me think that this was actually probably written either by a primary teacher
Or somebody who had spent a lot of time
With a lot of young children
Because this is what is the ideal
Do I think this could easily become my default word process?
Lutely not, it is so, so basic
It really is for somebody who's just learning out in the English language
Maybe learning to write for the first time
Or maybe who's just spelling is very poor
And they want to actually see the different spellings of different words
Quickly, rather than right click in and giving an option
Or clicking the spell checker
It can only type, you cannot input stuff into it
There's no options to insert, clipart or pictures
They tried copying and pasting of a picture that I had
It wouldn't do anything
In fact, it just kind of looked at me confusedly more than in the US
And then just kind of froze for five seconds
And then stopped, but then it came back on
So really, this is purely an electric type writer here you've got
Right, this is not a replacement
For open office writer or leave office writer
This is most definitely a lot more basic
I'd say it's somewhere in between
Basic as notepad
Or any just basic text editor
But it's nowhere near in the realms of a full word processor
Where do I think it's good?
If you have children, brilliant
If you have somebody maybe learning English for the first time
Again, this would be a great tool
But it is basic, you won't get very much out of fancy stuff out of it
The
In fact, even in my case the fonts
For some reason you clicked
And
Half the time, that was one bug I noticed about it
Half the time it would come up with that you only had one font
Other times it would give you a whole thing of fonts
So I'm not quite sure whether that's a bug they know about
Maybe I should actually submit a bug report
But it just seems
Such actually a simple thing that I would have thought that fonts would have changed quickly
But you know what they usually do
If you click on the font to change
If it doesn't change your first time, click on it again
You get a second time
So check that out, especially recommended for anybody involved
With education of young children
Or if you have a young child yourself
That is right type
I think you can pretty much tell the fact that it's a doodled W
And a doodled T
With that having incorporated smiley faces into it
That is the logo for this
That's a wee icon
You can probably tell it's not really for serious novelists
Or professional writers
More like a bit of fun
But it's good to see these kind of programs
Not everybody needs a full office suite
It's good to see that they're still a place in the system for these
And like I said, check it out
If you have children
Or you can maybe recommend a teacher
Specifically a primary school teacher
But apart from that
If you want something
To enter into this year's nano-rime competitions
I'd probably say
Look elsewhere, this one isn't for you
Now then I've probably waffled for long enough
So we've had two fairly chilled out tracks
So this one's going to rock it up a wee bit
This is crimson sun with don't care
The sun needs to make new things
Have some fun
Gave them more I feel so full
Look from the sun makes me feel comfortable
I cry my heart
With the wind
With the wind bring on the way
Yeah
When the evening falls
This poor world can write us
And just by it I would
I feel the fire even
Even more I feel lonely
Because when the sun makes me feel comfortable
I cry my heart
It's with the wind
With the wind bring on the way
Yeah
This only wind strong fit my face
I smile and feel so good again
When the sun shines
To the sun every sun feels easy
When the night has come
The moon lights up
The scenery will return
Oh no
Oh
Listen to the gals I feel still cry
The sun's sun makes me feel comfortable
I cry my heart
With the wind bring on the way
Yeah
This only wind strong fit my face
I smile and feel so good again
When the sun shines
To the sun every sun feels easy
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt The solo instrument in my face, I found you so excited When the song turns into cleanser Everything feels fucking easy
And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt And in this moment, no doubt and in a moment I'm dead
And now I want to turn that attention to a nice, wee simple app That I have to thank Gordon Sinclair Who mostly will probably know Beethoven as Thisode Wave on Identica
who's also my co-host of Criven's. He recommended a brilliant wee app called Radio Tree.
Well, he knows that I quite like listening to music and especially radio streams and also live podcast streams.
Now this is just one of these things. It's not a fancy tool. It does something particularly well.
First of all, it's not actually a mean big program in itself. It drops a symbol into your system tree
and it's just looks, it actually looks like the Wi-Fi connection Wi-Fi button on a laptop.
That's all looks like small silver and blue icon and by default it gives you jazz, Latin, classic,
classic rock, pop rock, oldies, chill country, techno electric,
and each of these come with about six different radio streams in. No, okay, that's not a heck of a
lot especially given the amount of radio, internet radio stations are right there but it does
give you a nice wee variety and personally I would like to maybe see a bit more towards my tastes,
but then again I like a heck of a lot but there's no metal in there which each did can annoy me
but I did quite like the classic rocks. So it's very, very easy to add as well individual
radio stations. So if you could favorite streams like one of the things first things that I listened to
was the live feed of the bug cast and of course that's not going to be on all the time but on a
Friday night it's great. Click and all you need to do is turn on radio 3 and then what else
just go to well I've saved under podcasts and then the bug cast that is it. You get it streamed
straight away. No big programs on the background this is not going to be an overload lighter than the
likes of running Clementine or Rhythmbox or Banshee or anything like that in the background it
is so so simple. How do you add things? Well all you do is nice and easy preference, configure
radios then it asks you do you want to create a new group which you can or you can just put it
straight into the sub menu or just straight into the top menu so I did one for local radio stations
so I just added that and then I added a variety of different Scottish ones and like I said it
works it's nothing fancy it certainly is not going to be winning any awards anytime soon it's
probably not even going to catch the eye of most people in fact some people would probably look
at it and go this is kind of pointless but I can tell you if you listen to internet radio it's
not it's a nice wee system a nice wee application sorry fits well in the system and it just works
you know it's one of those things but it'll probably never ever be updated and if it does good
if not I'm not going to be too bothered because it really doesn't actually need updated so
that may be kind of stating the obvious but if you listen to internet radio then ice would strongly
recommend this app and it's the one good thing is you can really create your own custom ice
playlist so you can quickly call them at any time it doesn't have to be 24-7 radio like I said
the bugcasters are actually only live for maybe two hours a week that's it but it still works not
a problem it does have a streaming problem sometimes with PLS playlist files so I have had problems
however with some radio stations when I have at the PLS and it didn't work all I did was choose
one the other stream so the real player or sadly to say Windows media player they both worked quite
well so just be wary of that if one doesn't work try a different one and I can say it for
me it worked fine I did a problem initially one the bugcasters ones and it kept on telling me
that the bugcasters wasn't on and I'm saying I know fine well it's on because I'm actually
listening to it in a different application but then try to try the other stream because bugcasters
two streams and that won't work so it's good obviously it's not perfect hopefully they'll get
these weekend of things ironed out but at the same time don't expect too much it is just one of
these nice three programs and I think pretty much anybody listening to this show will be able to
use it because it does not and I mean not use up much memory at all so go check that out now then
speaking of music let's have a wee bit more and this one is Tommy Tusser I don't want to cry
oh
Jenny knows the way downtown when I was 16 I followed around
so pretty in the neon light I worked in the streets all through the night oh well you should
see your laughing I wish I was her man she tells me how she feels alone and often dreams
romance and she said
that's what she said
I don't want to cry
I looked into her big sad eyes let's forget about it just for the night
she granted me a little bit then took me upstairs into her bed and she started with me slowly
so my love for her was wrong I told her it would be all right and that's when she lost control
and she said
that's what she said
but she is in her eyes
don't want to leave your sound she loved me that night
don't want to cry
oh
don't want to cry
oh
don't want to cry
oh
don't want to cry
oh
don't want to cry
oh
no
that's what she said
wait
when she is in her eyes
don't want to leave your sound she loved me that night
let's go get out of this town
my old life behind
that's what she said to me
but she is in her eyes
don't want to leave your sound she loved me that night
don't want to cry
oh
oh
and that one tonight Tommy Tucson was the only one that was not taken from
Germain Doe so that one was actually taken from Bad Panda Records so if you want to
hear more of him go check it out there links as always in the show notes
now we are going to move from the desktop over to the android phone and this is a browser that
I hadn't actually tried much of before and it's OR web and why is this one particularly standing out
because it's specifically I think the only browser that comes configured by default to use
Tor and in this the internet day of spying and trolls etc who doesn't need more privacy
now how does it behave because I found a lot of the browsers before really slowed down to
snails pace with Tor and almost kind of make it unusable well I can't see that for this
the speed of it was quite good I really was quite surprised it did not affect the overall
connection speed very much at all it did affect it a wee bit but not very much
now as far as the browser itself goes my word it is really basic so I mean obviously this is
kind of fairly still early stages of development but it really is basic there's no tabs you can only
have one one web page open at a time you just click on you can type in go you can click and go
and that will take you to whatever you want whatever the web address you've typed in you can go
forward you can go back you can reload the page or you can go to settings and I'm not kidding
that's it as far as behaving with the other plugins etc it seemed to behave with I did try it
with flash although I don't have flash on my phone anymore I did try it I briefly installed flash
gave it a try it worked so if you really wanted to you can do that you can in as far as setting goes
you can it's mainly to do with privacy settings the only thing you can really do is you can choose
to not load the images by default you can choose to enable a disabled JavaScript that's actually
disabled by default set the home page now you can in fact put in your own proxy settings and
choose your own proxy ports you can choose what user agent it is now this one was quite odd because
the range of options are not as maybe straightforward as I'd normally expect usually what I would expect
is Android or desktop well this one actually has Android default one you can choose to be an
iPhone an Nokia a Blackberry Firefox 5 or i.e. 8 I don't know why the heck anybody had wanted to
claim they were using i.e. anything but anyway that's the options to have so you can and the other
things are clear you cookies etc and you can choose to block all cookies things like that so this
is a but so it's been set up with a lot of privacy in mind as you would expect from anything
that is designed to run tour now please be warned that when you are actually using this
you will need to install the tour agent as well with it now I didn't I wasn't actually made
aware of that when I installed it on eftroid so instead if you have the play store go to the play
store and it'll tell you exactly it says this will not work without this because if you install
it will install but just nothing will connect ever and you'll be constantly left with unable to
connect to the internet unable to connect so take I said worthwhile definitely worthwhile if you
want to use tour on the mobile phone I will give you one piece of advice though disable your email
your email client because I had canine on this I still have canine on this and the problem was
every single email that canine was syncing to which were basically all my emails
it they all blocked me and they all pushed me to change passwords so this was a bit of a
problem because they all claimed oh it's someone from a undefined destination has tried access
it we've blocked this and we've disabled your password so I had to do this with every single one
of my emails so that is one thing I would recommend do not use this if you're going to be using your
email client again performance wise very happy as far as features go apart from outside of the
privacy settings I really think this still needs new features before I would even consider
using it as my default browser but because I deal mainly through the phone with all my email
client emails etc I would probably not use this in fact I've already actually taken it off to be
honest just so that I should get back to using my phone for my emails so if you do that if you don't
use your email through your phone by all means check out if privacy is a big thing then I would
highly recommend it performance is good they really have tweaked that I think we need a bit more
feature so guys yes you will it will run flash if you really wanted to I hate flash on the phone
it's a memory hug and also a battery hug oh it's terrible but insane that it runs nicely I would
just like to see a wee bit more sparkle to help this not even stand out from the crowd but even
maybe get to the level as the crowd because the majority of phone browsers now are certainly on
the ones I've tested do still use tabbed browsing so you can have two or three open at the same time
but like I said that's really down the personal preference I like that but it might not be tabbed
these tastes now then a wee bit more music and for this we are going back to gemendo and this is
reduced romantics and this is brain science
it's getting rainy and I'm stuck here lying flat on the floor
mattress with my head jammed against the wall
I got the job interview stuck and stuff and two skulls
it sounded okay but now I think I might just not go
if it's all the same I might just stay and I hope you don't come home too late
maybe I should study and sign up for some kind of course
get it certificate stick it up there on the wall
I can do brain science pay a big shot on tv
we could take holidays go somewhere nice overseas
but if it's all the same I might just stay and I hope you don't come home too late
so
I'm feeling guilty, you're at this slave in a way
Getting up early and running to the bus every day
I'll cook a treat, maybe something without kidney sauce
And we can sit around and laugh at this silly old world
And if it's all the same
I might just wait
I hope you don't come home
I hope you don't come home
To your late
And this brings us to the feedback section of the show
And sadly as the regular listeners know this is now the last segment of the show
But not a problem
No worries, we will be back soon
In fact, I can pretty much guarantee September, October and November time will not be anywhere near us
Hot as it was or even dry as it was over the summer months
So Tux-chan will be back on a more regular basis
I am sorry for the long layoff by the way
Now, while recently while I was on this break
I did actually talk with the guys from the Music Manumid podcast
And that one there is, I'll leave it in the notes in the link in the show notes
Should I say
And I was on 1,2,0,8,1,9, which is actually just the date
Nothing too exciting, they haven't actually done over 120,000 podcast shows
But that was actually a great yarn we had that day
And it's a good show if you take a listen to it
And if you actually enjoy the show
I would actually recommend you listen to the episode before mine
Where they actually had winmires from fitting the conniptions on there
So I recommend checking that out
Now, on my long hiatus there
I do get an awful lot of feedback from people
And just saying, is Tux-chan dead? What's the story with it?
And glad to see, no it's not dead
But I am truly, truly grateful for all the feedback I received
Because I honestly didn't realise that many people listened to Tux-chan
So it was nice to know I was missed
And hopefully it will be too long before the next show is out
And like I said, we can make this more regular
Remember, I don't want to get to the point where I'm saying I'm doing this
fortnightly or months because it is just as and when I get the chance to
I'm already doing a weekly show with Kriven's
And what I don't want to do is burn myself out
And then eventually just take a break from everything
That's what I don't want to happen
So hopefully you'll put, you my loyal and patient listeners will put up with me
And we'll get a show out another show out very soon
So hopefully you enjoyed that
One thing that I would say and I would really, really like
Please do this
Would you please start recommending not so much music
Because I listen to Kriven's music pretty much all day
Even when I'm at work I listen to it
But I'm not getting much of a chance to actually try out a lot of new
pieces of software, especially about the unknown stuff
So what I'd like you to do is recommend any piece of software
As long as I'm a creative comment
And nonsense creative comments for music
As long as it's open source
Then I don't mind
So anything, it could be a small, as Liquid Gordon mentioned
There, Radio 3, that's the tiny wee program
Or it could be a full office suite I've not heard of
Especially in Overwatch 1 and the making
Okay, I personally do use Libra Office as much as I can
But at the same time, I'm up for trying pretty much anything
I mean, I tried that one earlier
Typerite and okay, it's not for me
But it does have a purpose in this life that is a use for it
So please, no matter how small or large
I think it is, as long as it's open source
I would really appreciate you emailing me these
Or even just dent it and put the tag hashtag
tuxjam, or there's a group actually join the group
on Identica and post it in there
So you can also catch me on
daasbra, I'm kevy at joindaasbra.com
And as well as the Libertree project
I'm kevy there as well
We have an Unseen Studio account
which will post to join daasbra, or socially daasbra
Identica and Twitter
However, that is purely for announcements
So don't start having a wee yarn with us there
Because if you want a yarn with me, just do it at kevy
But I am not at kevy on Twitter
Somebody was saying that to me the other day
I messaged you on Twitter and you didn't respond
Well, the reason is that's not me
And I have never been on Twitter
And I don't have any future plans to go on Twitter
Thank you very much
But one last thing I'd like to say before I sign it
And other way, apart from emailing me
Which is you can just do that at kevyatunseenstudio.co.uk
Another way is I set up a pirate pad
So the pirate pad is piratepad.nate
forward slash tuxjam
So if you've got any songs, any software and like that
Pop on there and leave the name of it
And also please don't forget to leave the link
That's one other thing I'd like to point out
So I don't think I've got anything else left
So like I said, hopefully you've enjoyed this return
I'm not going to go down the route of calling it season 2
I really want to avoid that
So this has been tuxjam episode 15
We're bringing it to our close with
Plastic 3
And this is commercial high-tech music
So a nice bit of an electro-instrumental stuff here
Just to send you off
So if this is late on at night, you can have a wee dose of this
Anyway, I shall be catching you in the next episode of
Crivens, which will be the big 3O
Wow, Crivens 30
And tuxjam 16
Okay, if you haven't checked out the new website
Please do, it's still a welcome progress
I haven't got the graphics on there yet
But it's cast.unseenstudio.co.uk
So until next time, adios
See you next time
Thanks for watching
Thanks for watching
See you next time
