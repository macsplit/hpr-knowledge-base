AMAZING
Hi, my name is Mike Engleek and I thought I'd record a quick show for Hacker Public Radio.
I was at AgCamp 11 over the weekend just gone 13 for 14 for August and I was introduced
to the joys of Hacker Public Radio from the display stand there so I thought I'd crack
up my microphone, my rubbishy little pros and USB microphone and record a little something
for Hacker Public Radio and I'm just going to record a little piece about how I got
into Linux. It might be interesting for people, it may not, I don't know. It may serve as
a lesson for us all but I first tried to get into Linux years ago with a red hat disk.
We were talking before Fedora Core here, we were talking years ago and it was a PC format,
disc or something like this and it had a Fedora or red hat disk on the front. I can remember
vividly loading this disk and he's going to be brilliant. I've heard all about his Linux
stuff, he's going to be ace. I've got a PC that I'd set aside especially for it, I'd
managed to clean up and sort of build a Franken PC, you know, couple of bits together
out of other PCs and I thought this would do and I installed it and I got a black screen
with a cursor and I spent the next three hours trying to figure out how to add a user
so I could log in to it and how to actually use the system I'd set up and in the end
I became that disenfranchised with it, I turned it off, went back to Windows and stayed
on Windows for a few years and it wasn't until about 2007 something like that that I was
introduced to Linux by a then colleague Tim Brown, he was a big Ubuntu user and said
you need to try this Ubuntu desktop, it's really cool, you've tried Linux before but this
is ace and he was not wrong, I've been using Ubuntu ever since so I've been here since
I've been using Ubuntu since 606 so I've been using it for a while now and it's just great,
I'm recording this on a little ace respire one netbook running, well it's Ubuntu 1104, my main
desktop in the office is running Ubuntu 1004 and my laptop, I say my laptop, the wife and
mine's laptop, we share that custody of a laptop, it's 50% Windows, 50% Linux but when
I boot it, it boots Linux and boots 1104, so that's how I got into Linux anyway, so hopefully
I'm going to be submitting a few more shows, I've got an idea for a show that I want to
pitch through to the hacker and geek community and see if I can harness the power of the
geek crowd, but yeah, so cool, thanks a lot, that you hide it when you start recording
and machine looks.
Thank you for listening to Hacker Republic Radio, for more information on the show and
