Hello, this is Archer 72.
Welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
In this episode,
in this episode I ponder whether or not optical media is dead.
Actually, that's not the case.
I'm just bringing information, inspired by glad to about a year ago,
and also the Q is low.
So, here goes.
First thing is what the media size is.
4.7GB DVD is actually capacity is 4.377GB.
So, you know how much room you'd have to work with to put data on a DVD.
And with Blu-ray, a disk with a 25GB capacity is the equivalent of 23.28GB.
And one normally rated at 50GB.
And practice can record about 46.57GB of data.
First, you generate a iso image with gen iso image,
or alternatively make a iso fs with gen iso image space dash u, space dash r,
space allow lowercase, space dash allow multidot,
dash o, mydvd.iso, and then quotes $1 sign 1, signifying on input.
When I went back to look at this command, I noticed that it was a little messy with the dash u flag.
And also, I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have used this command verbatim because the dash u
allows for untranslated filings completely validating the iso 9660 standards described above.
It enables the following flags dash allow leading dots dash relax file names.
dash allow lowercase dash allow multidot dot dash no iso translate allows more than one period
character in the file name as well as mixed case file names. This is useful on hpux
where the built-in cdfs file system does not recognize any extension used with extreme caution.
What I did keep in this command was the dash r which generates susp and rock ridge
records using the rock ridge protocol to further describe the files on the iso 9660 file system.
See reference in the Wikipedia article.
Now you're ready to burn your data from the iso file.
The note though is in the arch wiki for grow isofs is make sure that the medium is not mounted
before you write to it. Okay, that actually all so applies to any optical media.
Mounting may happen automatically if the medium contains a reasonable,
for the medium contains a readable file system. In the best case it will prevent the burn
programs from using the burner device. In the worst case there will be a misburden
because read operations disturb the drive. If so, do unmount slash dev slash sr0.
Grow isofs has a small bug with blank dvd correction with blank bd dash r media.
It issues an error after the burn is complete. Programs like k3b then believe the whole burn
failed. To prevent this either format the blank bd r by dvd plus rw format dev sr0 before
submitting it to grow isofs or use great grow isofs option use the force loop equals spare colon
none. To burn a readily prepared iso image file iso image. iso onto an optical medium run for cd
cd record dash v dash s a0 dev equals slash dev slash sr0 space iso image. iso in the ss
s a0 or s a0 means session at once and for dvd or blue redisk use great grow isofs dash dvd dash
compact space dash c space slash dev slash sr0 equals iso image dot iso
another command that can be used with cd dvd or blue ray is x or iso
dash a s cd record dash v dev equals slash dev space
sr0 space dash d a0 d a0 space iso image dot iso
and d a0 means disc at once did it again d a0 means disc at once one tip i found when i was
preparing for the show was to not put your optical media in paper sleeves instead put them in
jewel cases that's all i have for now have fun using the command line
and feel free to record a shower of your own
