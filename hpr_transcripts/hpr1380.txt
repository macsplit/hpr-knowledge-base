So, that's the moment when no one says anything anymore.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Well, the other's the other's, the other's the note, right?
The thing has like 40 hours of recording time.
We had run all day.
This should be, should be enough, I don't think, you could even run it the whole walk
kind of, right?
Yeah.
And then I put my F-48 hours, it's on a 2G card and I put my 16G again and it just went
up to 99999.
All right.
Yeah, I think I've got a 16G card in the Sansa clip, I could record a lot without
anything.
But the quality is not that good.
Can I just use those for one second?
Yeah.
Cheers.
It's like a craft camp.
Yeah.
Maybe I can't do it that close up.
Hello?
No pattern just yet?
Well, give me text maybe.
But then there's nobody, there's nobody there.
Oh!
He doesn't know his number.
Probably not.
You don't have to read me anything.
That's enough to think.
I think you're a cheque star, isn't it?
Huh?
You cheque star, isn't it?
Yeah, it's only a source.
I'm doing the documentation.
The recorder is on by the way.
Say hello.
Hello.
Hello.
What's that?
Hey, I'll come in.
If I keep going, it doesn't get darker.
I...
It's...
It's...
It's iffy.
Nothing like leaving experiments.
Trials in there.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials in there.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
Trials.
It's some of the bitch.
This one is a goner.
Did he bring it right there?
This one's rollin'
Oh, that wasn't too much heat.
No, I didn't have that paper over it.
I didn't have that paper over it.
No, I didn't touch it.
Plastic.
Oh, alright.
That's probably not the time you could idea.
Alright, it's even on the iron now.
Oh, no.
We should scrape it.
Ah, that's sticky.
I screwed up a shirt.
How about now?
Well, yeah, okay.
This is not good.
I just threw him out of there.
What have you done?
The iron touched the iron on it and melted the plastic.
Yeah.
So the rest is on the iron now.
I think it's easier to clean if one is seen.
I might be down to one shirt now.
It's on the wall.
Yeah, I'm going to cherish by there a bit.
Four people in one room.
Is the window open?
Oh, the window is open.
But you do have to spare shirt.
This is my last one in here.
Alright.
So you'll have the rest here at the moment.
Uh oh.
I learned from my mistakes, Benny.
Yeah.
You have to have that tissue paper over everything.
Got you managed to get in this morning?
I don't know.
Oh, I can't believe I did it.
You don't have regular just printer paper.
We can try taking it off.
Then I'm just going to take four.
I'm going to be in the back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a couple of shirts there.
Maybe...
I'm going hard.
It's on the lurch.
Do you want to go like a lamp here?
No.
No, your hair one will see.
Just put your hair...
Carried.
Don't put your hair on.
Thank you.
I had to go back a second time to try and fix it.
I ruined it.
More heat.
Yeah.
That's what I was doing trying to get blacker on that.
Too much heat and leak over.
Perfect.
Foreground man doing iron one.
So, you're very good at ironing all the shirts at home.
You think you need more heat?
Or is it?
How many guys does it?
Wow, are you for hire?
You start?
Oh, you should let Tim Tim me do that.
Fingers crossed.
Oh, that was awesome.
Nearly.
It's nearly awesome.
One more touch.
This is how I messed up though.
Fatal one last.
See, that's how it...
Yeah.
This is how I arch and install usually goes wrong.
I just need to treat one more thing.
By the way, that's for your shirt.
Yeah, yeah.
Is that the one?
Yeah.
If I want to run away.
Okay, let me get it.
We're in the same shirt today.
We're going to be able to find a shirt in town.
Oh, there's loads.
Yeah.
Wow, we don't fit in.
That's a good thing.
We're all small dogs.
Okay, I'm not touching it.
Nope, done.
Let's see if I mess it up at all.
It's simply to happen.
There's more paper there if you need to print anything.
I'll print out the instructions on irony.
Yeah.
I'll make a try over the white ones.
I'll just call it distressed.
Is it looking like...
Terrible.
This is the tip of the irony.
That's the tail of the irony.
You've got to make sure that paper stays over.
I had the paper like this.
Okay.
Yeah, vintage.
Yeah, retro.
That's what I'm just making.
Four guys and we brought one pair of scissors.
Did you bring any?
No, I didn't.
It wasn't going to go through the TSA.
It's probably going to take only flight.
I'm going to make sure it's for four guys.
You can check in luggage.
I brought my Swiss orami knife.
It's only one of those because I still didn't get them.
I ordered them like one year ago.
Yeah, but never arrived.
You're not allowed to carry knives.
Nothing like a small one.
We don't have guns, so everybody runs around stepping each other.
So the politicians went day mock and you're not allowed to have knives.
I encourage something like that here.
No, you can't even carry that.
I don't think that would work in Switzerland.
We do carry around like orami knives.
It's in the difference.
We don't have shootings.
Yeah.
I'm feeling nice.
We even get the weapons to shoot each other from a stake.
Everyone who joins the Orami gets a gun to take home.
Oh, you got it.
Takes time though.
Next weekend is sewing if you can all come back.
We're going to do patches on elbows.
You mind if I take one of them?
Yeah, that's what I brought.
I'll try to get some more stickers off the sweat.
The blowfish is on the laptop you're going to print one off.
The Open DSD.
Oh, worry.
Well, you mean for a teacher?
Yeah, there's all sorts of logos on the laptop.
Good.
Thank you.
Yeah, best stickers.
There's different miscellaneous.
Oh, so now you guys know how to use two pieces of this paper.
Yeah.
Because I've got to learn my lesson.
I had a gesture.
Yelved me because I was a bit scared.
You've got to stick on my laptop.
Or put a few other stickers until I don't.
Over it?
Yeah.
I didn't go down too long.
I think I need this one.
Finally, for the back of my car.
I wonder if he even sent him out or they just got lost in the mail.
Everything I've said he was cutting.
Last time I asked him was like in February.
And he said it was a pre-order.
He will do.
Like, he had days, but the other ones I ordered, he didn't do them.
Then he was doing it.
Oh, it's like an ironing championship.
I think he's got it.
With last ones.
This is careful though.
Too much he didn't do it.
Yeah.
Oh, maybe pressure.
Oh, yes, this has come out the best so far.
Yeah.
But standing on the...
It's your lesson.
Yeah, I'm thinking that one, I say.
Oh, I think you're there to it.
He's on it.
That was my fatal mistake.
Awesome.
It's smoking.
What about one over the top?
I think I would save it.
Oh.
Over the top of the black one.
Yeah, maybe in plastic.
All right, I'll try and remove the black one.
Yeah, try and remove that one.
No black ones, yeah.
Pretty similar.
Sears.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
Crowns?
Crowns.
Crowns.
Yeah.
Crowns.
Crowns.
Yeah.
So don't ruin this one.
Yeah.
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, that one.
That's my last.
Let me see that piece of paper.
It has instructions.
Oh, great.
Oh, you.
You have to use the instructions.
Yeah.
You have to use the instructions.
Yeah.
You have to use the instructions.
Yeah.
You have to use the instructions.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, it works with the every paper.
I'm not sure what this one is.
That's good to go to the ends.
Yeah.
Why did you use this one?
It doesn't make it a chance for how long it's pre-placed.
I'll leave the instructions on the back.
Yeah.
Oh, yes, it's working.
Yeah.
Got to find more paper.
Yeah, let's get a picture of that.
This is what not to do.
Hiking.
Hiking teachers.
So, in my bill, it's going to make a HBI episode.
How to hack a T-shirt.
I'm ruined.
No, we're ruined.
Can Pam and Wilton be proud of you?
Oh, that's the other way up, I think.
Tomorrow I'll go to your airport directly from Auckland.
Right.
I'll end up at the airport with a T-shirt sitting here.
Heck, I'm probably brilliant.
Could you please take your shirt off?
That EFF one that says I do not consent to the search for this device
and put out a badge on your shirt.
That was the last thing I ever saw of them.
Well, I actually did one of those on the computer.
When I went through security in the airport,
I just put the laptop upside down.
He already harassed me for having paper in my back pocket.
I thought, that's not to take a chance.
I've got one of those warning stickers on my laptop.
It's an official sticker from the Swiss government.
Problem is, I have a lot of HPR stickers and the EFF stickers.
There's a sticker from the German pump band as well,
like Reichsartner.
That's probably not what you wanted to do.
There's no control seat with the iron, is it?
Move crap iron on dead null.
Come on.
Oh, because there's people on YouTube.
Oh, really?
I was sitting at Peter at the exhibition yesterday.
The reason I had so good stats in my downloads was I was doing curl
and pulling down the download and piping it to dead null.
I think I'm going to do that just once for messing it with you.
I'm just pulling my hundreds.
Just put a loop on it and pull like hundreds of episodes down.
We're going, ah!
Oh, so close.
We're holding up the hot production line.
Also, if you want to have him go up and say him and Sam and Fips, like Boris.
Yeah, I heard him.
Did they even ever talk to each other?
No, because he thinks Sam and Fips are stable standards.
Well, talking about open source in front of a lot of people and they're being on the map.
I know what I need, I need it.
Come on.
It's a nice piece.
I nearly saved it.
What a thought iron would be so fun.
An hard work.
Yeah, I'm sweating actually.
I need a second.
So next time we'll sue our own teacher, which is bring cloth.
Yeah.
The sewing machine.
Actually, the sewing machine.
But last year they had sewing machines at the odd count.
She's just taking them all out there.
Yeah, but I'm sure they have her so they can sue patterns.
So if we brought some pattern that has the specs, we could probably have had them.
Like the logo on.
SVG, that's all we got.
Yeah.
Although I don't think so.
Yeah.
So that was tough way through.
That was the racing process.
Yeah.
Somebody you want to go?
Somebody's ready to go?
Yeah.
So this one's done.
Wow.
Oh.
Red devil.
What would you see?
It all makes sense when you see the avatar.
Yeah.
Well, I have to say Mrs. N. White though.
She finally saw I put mustard on the phone and then I showed her these guys talking.
Oh, I know these two.
Which ones?
When she saw the avatar, she tied it all together.
Oh, we're going to try to wait one over there.
Oh, you can have a black one.
I'll try the white one on this shirt.
Yeah, I'm not worried about it.
Oh, why?
Did you cut the white one out?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
I'm only a trim bit cornered off.
It'll be a bit bigger than a black one.
No, I was thinking if I make a white border, it'll cover up the ink.
Yeah.
Blue lines?
Yeah.
This black one white is going to...
That's the failure teacher.
It's going to be different than all the rest.
But that's from getting it off the paper.
Oh, did you not like it cool a little bit?
Maybe it was on before you take it off.
You tear it a bit so it gets stretched.
Yeah, they see it a little cool.
You want to try the removal process?
No, I think that's okay.
No reason to do it perfect.
So this is not the sheddy, but this is the...
That's fine.
Yeah, but just...
It's the same.
Exactly the same.
The sheddy's...
Oh, the room's here at home.
Oh, okay.
I don't want to just move away from home with the white one.
But they all are that's tethering the phone.
Okay.
And even cheap.
Yeah.
Even real cheap.
Yeah.
Well, that almost...
It's supposed to be in 1999.
If you buy them, yeah.
It's all the evils.
Anyway.
It's pretty cool.
What's going on?
I don't know if you know.
I don't know.
I think when I...
Hopefully they're going to announce the next one's five soon.
Because I need a new phone.
I don't know going to put the Firefox on the other one.
Bring up the contacts on that one.
That's the only bad bit.
And that's if I've got all the contacts imported on that.
All right.
Well, there are two contacts, but still.
Who else is ready to go?
Real slow.
No, it kind of just any three there.
Yeah.
But scrolling is slow.
Scrolling is slow.
Yeah.
Not just scrolling.
It's a load.
Oh, okay.
There's a TI that I did use for a week.
I forced myself to use it for a week.
Every time you go, you don't bring up a number.
It was real painful.
Do you think the contacts are wrong?
There is someone did write an app for importing decards.
All right.
So I exported the Nokia one to a big pile of decards.
I did...
Actually, when I moved to my co-lap, I had to import all the contacts
to my co-lap.
That's quite easy.
But I'm using mud.
And there's no color sync to mud.
So I had to import all the decards to mud.
And that was a bit more of a challenge.
But someone made a script.
Yeah.
It's still would be nice to be able to just use color.
Probably the best.
I should push it really.
No.
Are you going to use this one?
Anyone can use them yet?
So I just put them back to my crew.
Yeah.
Just that culture.
Those ones were printed out from ones I didn't get.
And then built it properly.
Yeah.
In English.
Ooh.
You know, sync's good.
But this one looks cool because it looks like it's really splash.
I'm not going to touch it anymore.
That's all right.
Yeah.
This is the best one.
Right, that is all right.
Oh man.
You can't take them.
Oh, shit.
That's mine.
That's mine.
That's mine.
We're brilliant.
You want to hit it?
You want to hit it?
You want to hit it?
You want to hit it?
Yeah.
Thanks for the effort.
I'm okay.
Oh.
That's okay.
That's the worst.
I don't care.
I just need to use it for one day.
Yeah.
What a mess.
You know what I'm going to do?
I should just.
Well.
All right.
One more shot.
They know the easy things today.
Could I have that white one, then, do they?
Yeah.
No worries.
So I'm going to go with a white one.
No, I'm not.
I know that you guys are in mine.
No, but they had the big one.
It's to try one black T-shirt and it looks like they're there.
Holy shit, bro.
I took your first shirt and took your eye off of it.
That's why I was just thinking about it.
Wow.
We got our production on it.
Well, it's always a place for improvements.
Oh, man.
Now it sucks.
Are you done?
Get out of the production area.
Oh.
So that removal process.
Me removing your.
Yeah.
With friends like these.
So I'm going to install large and you compute the same.
Oh, man.
Just because you thought it was your right.
No, no, no.
We were talking about it yesterday.
No, no.
Maybe because I want to install large when I'm drunk.
And it's not going to be my computer.
In my build has nodes.
Arch.
Now crunch bang install might as well upgrade that one.
So we need to put up one more.
Yeah.
Oh, I need another feature as well.
Do you need a brand new one there?
Yeah.
How cutting that one out?
No, I'll have some.
Yeah.
Up to you.
Finally.
You know, get it out of the production area.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Brilliant.
Yeah, you better get this away from me.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Well, maybe I'll.
Next time I'll bring in red t-shirts.
Oh, we were so proud of her.
Or I was so proud of how the removal process was going.
But it was good.
Now you're practiced for your next.
It's good to try and someone else is sure.
You're ready for your shirt.
Yeah, that's what's going to happen to your computer.
I'm going to try on your computer before I try on mine.
You know what?
I owe you just handing away.
And you can hand it back.
You probably have windows on it.
And I'm not that cruel.
64-bit install is 30-bit.
Yeah, it makes the library.
Yeah, that's fun.
Yeah, but you also have 32 on the EE.
I don't think you can install it.
Or maybe you know, depending on the process.
Well, you could install Plan 9 if I don't think so.
Yeah.
No one's that cruel.
What's more cruel?
Windows or Plan 9?
No.
I'd be the first touch of Windows 8 every day.
Which was just a removal.
It boots fast.
I'll give it that.
But that doesn't help if you can use it after a week.
I've never seen it.
Everyone's in a while.
I'll get a customer last.
How do I connect wireless?
Operating system.
You have Windows 8.
Have a nice day.
I have no idea.
I mean, try to hit the window button.
What happens?
I don't know.
I'll have someone call you.
I have a Windows one can call you.
I've got a Windows phone.
My brother's got an iPhone.
And my mother wanted to get a smartphone.
So she went to her dealer for a computer.
And he told her in Windows phone.
No, we were like, we can't help you.
Because I know how to do things in Android.
My brother knows how to do things in iPhone.
She gets a Windows phone.
A few weeks later, she was like,
I don't know how to switch on the GPS.
Well, I don't know.
Get someone to help you.
I've got to ask the guy who sold it.
Yeah, exactly.
But he doesn't know either because the phone he sold her,
he doesn't use it himself.
He's got no one.
I don't know.
I told her to get the Android.
I had to listen to it.
I had to buy my parents and their computer.
Well, they'll have to have Windows.
If I'm not around, someone else needs to be able to help them.
So I was looking for a laptop with a Windows 7.
Took me two months to find one.
Fucking hell.
I just imagined them.
Because they started using Windows XP.
Then I put them on Linux Mint.
Because the computer crashed and they could get one of my old ones.
And then going to Windows 8.
Yeah, that would have been horrible.
Don't encourage me.
When he's done, the bed cover is covered in HPR stickers.
Is there a white one left?
Yeah, there's loads of white ones there.
All right, something else.
There's black and white ones.
I don't take one of these.
There's a second door.
A second door.
There would be the airport.
Oh, this is impossible, can't I?
No, actually, I did a one really nice one, you know?
To one, the one you moved.
I'll do one for him.
It's a little bit more far.
I could.
Very good.
Oh, this is fun.
This was an adventure.
Through, make one good one.
Yeah.
So you can make a clean white one.
Just wait.
That one?
Yeah, these little ones.
Okay.
Is this an arena?
Yeah.
That's the white audience.
This might go right over the whole top of that.
I can do it on the harder surface.
Maybe right on the floor.
Yeah.
Anyone ready to iron?
Yeah, sure.
Or do you want to iron it?
No, I need to take it.
On the...
Oh, yeah, on the floor.
You did the perfect job with a last of mine, say.
I'm so tempted to go find a t-shirt in there.
In a shot.
Do you think they'll go around?
Yeah.
If you just go down, you'll end up at the shopping area.
The test goes to you.
The test goes just on there.
So we've got a little test.
How is it?
We've got to get up there soon.
No, it's three years, four or five minutes until they're over.
Still plenty of time.
But we still need to get the proper coffee first.
Oh, yeah.
They have proper coffee in there.
They did last, yeah.
The leaf came up in there?
Yeah, hopefully.
They're going to do the same this year.
The coffee would have been okay if it had been hot.
With the warm breakfast.
Yeah, it was definitely better than the tea I had yesterday.
The tea was just like hot water with milk.
Can't have everything.
Well, how does one of the bands on your tea show?
Yeah, I guess so.
They're not exactly well known bands.
No, no.
I know that one.
Yeah, I know that one.
I was going to bring this one just to...
Because it's fun.
Getting my TikTok and...
Rallyed up.
So I've read T-shirt.
Union is full.
Yeah.
Just to be really memorable.
That bit of the iron.
All right.
I can feel it.
See, you're right out over the edges.
I want to take the ones for the white tea shirts.
They're damn so easy to use.
Yeah, but someone here can't wear a white tea shirt.
No, nobody likes it.
You can't get into Switzerland after that.
Exactly.
No, you're wearing a white tea shirt.
You lost your citizenship.
Goodbye.
Have a nice day.
Germany is that way.
Greenode.
Heck, you're probably ready.
Oh, this is quite fun wearing through the...
What are you doing?
All right.
It should be okay.
All right.
I'll have a go-album this way.
This is going to be fun.
And make sure you stash it somewhere safe.
Before he gets back.
How do you...
I'm going to do a new one, so yeah.
Let's start on this one.
That's fun.
That's fun.
I lost one name when we were short.
The only one.
The only one.
And it's probably not that easy to iron them on the sleeve.
No.
Because you don't even get the wood board into the tree.
No, I would risk it.
You have no pain in the vein there.
The white ones you peel afterwards?
Oh.
Yeah.
It's going to be fun when I need to connect my computer to the venue.
Because I'll be...
I use Netsi GL.
Yeah.
Connecting Wi-Fi.
I'm going to last year.
It was a bit of a fabricating to connect just to the network.
Like a cable into the room.
But that...
I'd let it cool before you paint it as well.
Yeah.
Well, if you mess up, just tell Bill to remove it.
Yeah.
He's a ship, but...
I don't have anything.
Everything's perfect.
Yeah.
Except the first one.
And that was...
I can't have a perfect shirt.
Same.
Yeah, I think Bill figured.
You're not going to notice when that's all?
No, that's okay.
Man, it's all putting that stuff on the other one.
I don't know.
You didn't print your dosie properly.
No, no, no, no.
That's...
You probably got it from my stash note down.
Yeah.
Well, it's cropped.
Yeah, yeah.
Because I couldn't...
I don't have to size it a bit smaller, but...
I couldn't do it.
So I just chopped it up.
It should have said, because I have the original one.
Yeah.
And nick it once from...
I don't know.
Oh, what's your name there?
Oh, I'm just starting to feel agraphobic.
It's just too much roomy.
Oh, I go this way and up around and I can't find a test code.
Down.
So I ask a guy in the back, a Scottish guy,
to go through that wee little alley there,
and go down, couldn't find it.
That's another guy who walked me right to it,
and there's no key shirts.
Oh, I'm...
I'm going to have to salvage one of these.
There's another share if you want to film.
I reckon it...
It's always maybe the end of the issue.
That's brand new.
How big is...
2XL?
Yeah, let me put H power on it.
It's a short one.
That could be fun.
Let me try salvage this one.
Oh!
You...
Just shirts the roof.
There.
You know the shower.
Do you have more paper?
51-53 chance.
Oh, about 42, I think.
I could just leave it like this, the distressed look.
Yeah, but I think vintage.
How about shit?
So it's only going to make one thing shitty for a distra?
Yeah, hashtag shitty.
I imagine you will be...
Happy.
I'm going to use the through removal technique.
Yep.
Wicked out so well before.
You finish yours?
Not the game?
Yep.
Oh!
I take the heat off your peel.
That's what I think is cool now, but the time will get away.
That's a good choice.
No, he...
Yeah, a lot more heat I guess.
It's getting warm in here.
What's that?
The four of us heating.
Two kilowatt iron.
Yeah, ready?
That's hot.
You burn your fingers?
I think, yeah.
It smells like plastic, so probably not the vet thing to get any fingers.
Oh, it works even better without heat.
Continue removal methods.
Should rip the damn thing off.
Oh, that doesn't leave any glue behind either.
So you have another one in here?
Yeah, but that's in the room.
I need to pick it up.
Ready?
Yeah, for it.
And for some reason, I'll take out the battery, but I don't need to take a typical leak.
Great?
Another one I have.
You have to take out the battery, too.
Yeah, it's the same with the A900.
It's beneath the battery.
Yeah.
That's just for the vintage look.
Yeah?
This is brilliant.
Just going like, up camp, I was there.
It was a fight.
It was...
Sure toward struggle.
Okay, that's it.
Smaller or better, I guess.
Okay, I'll go grab some glue.
Just keep the belt away from the tissue.
All right.
Wow, let's do the other side.
I think we'll get over.
Yeah, so come out tomorrow, I'm going to take a minute.
Yeah.
I thought we'd have a uniform.
We're all in mixed.
Yeah.
We're going to have a big weight on the back of this.
Yeah, that's going to work on one of my shirts, too.
We could make today the black shirt day, and tomorrow, like the white shirt day.
Are we still talking shirts after all this?
Oh, all right.
Well, two here.
Oh, yeah.
If I can grab another shirt out today, I'll just go over that part.
Is that like baked right there?
Yeah, I think it is.
Is this a black transfer?
No, that's the white one.
Getting these these, we're going to print another one off.
No, it's a...
Is this on black transfer paper?
No, that's white.
It's a black... yeah, it's always a black transfer.
Yeah, I'll use it.
You just trim it.
See, this is similar to the log.
I can do things in my own room quietly and doing very well, and you get in a room and start talking.
And you remove the roots?
Oh, you're not?
Yeah, that's...
That's the told you.
I try to remove my slush juices.
I've been because...
Yeah.
I've made a slush juice that's been in my home folder.
And I was a bit...
Luckily, I wasn't rude.
That was two days before I'd come.
I would have had to reinstall my laptop.
If they're all this fun, it might be your favourite souvenir teacher.
The burn mark.
That's going to hang up my wall when I get home.
Favorite sput?
Yeah, I'll let you earn it this time.
You called me an expert when we started?
Come on.
Yes, no.
Go for it.
That's the winner, Marshall.
Awesome.
I have a uniform.
No, where's the...
I like it.
Hopefully, sir.
Excellent.
I think I'll have one teacher that's okay.
We can probably do another one next year.
Yeah.
Because...
It's getting worse.
