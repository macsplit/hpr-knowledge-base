Sometimes I give you a light smile as you're talking to me.
I'm giving you the attention, the attention you should see.
And sometimes I spend too much time hanging out with the boys.
I laughin' about techin' jokes and talkin' bout techy toys.
But I know it isn't.
It's what gets you wanna cheat.
I know it isn't.
Living with a geek.
I'm talkin' bout binary.
Cause if it's a language, you should teach it.
And I sling the open souls again and you tell me that I preach.
I watch TV with you, but it has to be sci-fi.
I think it's starting to like it though.
And I bet you you can tell me why, why, why.
And I know it isn't.
It's what gets you wanna cheat.
And I know it isn't.
Living with a geek.
Living with a geek.
I read too many books about Python and Pearl and PHP.
I hope you'll computer and the kitchen and to the TV.
I try to talk to you about DCPRP.
And then I catch you flaky hours.
And you laugh at me.
Yeah, you laugh at me.
And I love you more than minutes.
And a day of the week.
And I know it isn't.
That you're married.
To a podcasting geek.
Living with a geek.
Living with a geek.
Living with a geek.
