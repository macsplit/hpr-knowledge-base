Hello everybody. My name is Ken Phalan and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio Community News
for June 2017. Joining me tonight is... Hello, it's Dave Morris. Hi Dave. I'm
said earlier I'm in a way for so long that I barely remember how to do this anymore.
Yeah yeah it does seem to be quite well isn't it? Yeah well these things happen but
it's good that we can manage to get this together and my my pal John JWP is
is away in the States I think just now so it was just going to be me and just imagine how horrible
that would have been. Yeah it was nice actually to hear the show from another point of view which is
which is good JWP is nice. Although he's got a crappy natural connection but that's to be said.
It just uh yeah probably wasn't worse before Truncade silence come along.
Oh there were lots and lots and lots. I actually did a bit of editing on that one to try and
chop out some of the some of the gaps but yeah it's you mean you used to get that sorted.
Oh he's a good guy. He had a really nice time over and uh first time as you didn't bother coming
over Dave. That was really cool. Now he's a good guy. He seems to enjoy first time as much as we
do it isn't he? So that's a good time there. Okay for people who don't know Hacker Public Radio is
a community podcast which means the shows are contributed by regular old folks who will listen to
it namely like some myself and yourself and if you're listening to HPR consider giving us a show
introducing yourself and we'll be sure to comment and give you ideas for other shows.
So this show is scheduled once a month and we basically do a quick round up of what we thought of
last month's show just to make sure that everybody gets some feedback on their on their show
and give you any other things that's been happening on the website or on the community mailing list
or any shows that people are going around your announcement set their health. But we always
start off by introducing new hosts and because I butcher people's names so badly this is usually
delegated to Dave. Okay this one's easy though. We have a new host of Mongo and BJB and welcome to
the network. So let's start with going through the shows shall we? Episode 2304 using GNOME 3 for the
first time which was very fortuitous actually given that Ubuntu have switched to GNOME 3. I don't
think that had even been announced at the time the show was posted. Yeah I'm not sure but yeah it
was very timely. It was an interesting overview and it was from XFCE I think. So yeah it's an
interesting move. Even Beezy had a comment there that the XF dashboard is great show. I currently
use GNOME and XFCE on different measures. I like if you like the dashboard from GNOME you should
check out XF- for XFCE. You provide a GNOME like dashboard experience. You just need to change the
keyboard call XF-board instead of the normal XFCE launcher. Good took there. Yeah I didn't know he's
obviously got much deeper into XFCE than I have. I've been using it for several years now but
that's cool. I've not looked into that one. A little run through of XFCE dashboard would be a good show
don't you think? I think it would be a wonderful thing yes. Thank you somebody who can
get lost out of it. Okay, hint hint hint hint no you know there you go. Configuring a HP
laptop for dual boot Linux and Windows 10 and this is from our new host Mungo and this was
how to get GNOME 16 or 4 from Ubuntu to boot with Windows 10 home. This was quite interesting actually.
Very good. Yeah yeah it was a good first show I thought and there was some good stuff in here
to get to GNOME from Windows and still keep it. Keep it foot in the other camp. It's not a thing I've
ever done personally but yeah it's good if you're doing that and was concerned about the consequences.
Yeah I've been thinking about it like we haven't run ever run a Windows machine here and I've
been thinking about just having a Windows 10 home version or something just to make sure that USB
sticks and stuff read okay but I actually usually end up sending it into running it on a remote
Windows machine and just checking that it works there so but there you go. So we had two comments
there. Steve said it was an excellent tutorial on how to get dual development environment working
if I ever need to know this or know somebody who does I will send them here and actually I do know
quite a few people in work who are dual booting so this is a good show for them. Absolutely.
Mongo came back with a reply which was Steve thanks for the comment. There seems to be a
perception that Windows 10 is harder to deal with than previous versions and it really isn't.
I hope the show helps someone get started on a useful project. So that's good to know actually
impression that Windows 10 is difficult is very prevailing so it's good to get somebody's given
a slightly different view of it. I think it's just a UI difference. What gets me about is that you're
you have this whole new UI and then you drop down to like Windows 95 dialogues in certain places
you know and then you I also have the same thing with with OS X as well OS X where the different
UIs of the application have not been updated in you know they're still dialogue boxes from various
different versions back widget libraries that's what I'm mean to say. Something that Linux have
been accused of for years and years and years. It's hard to you to thought that those sorts of
things would have been dying designed so that they excuse my neighbor's dog he's having a
having a bit for play it. You'd have thought it would it would they would all be using the same
underlying I don't know files of specifications or something that made you just switch one thing
and everything would change you would have thought but no obviously no work like that. So we had
the following day was HPR Community News. You did a fantastic job as always don't know why I'm
bother coming back at all this. Yeah we're trying to get rid of you. It's an undermining effort.
Feel free. Feel free. So the next day was 2, 3, 0, 4 both fang UV5 or you VHF UHF handset which I am
now allowed to say that I do actually physically own and it is physically here because I checked
the law and in the Netherlands you are allowed to have it but the battery has to be stored in a separate
location but I have borrowed it up so there you go. Right. Why must the battery be you know allowed
to switch it on or something? Yeah you're not allowed to switch it on but you are allowed to you are
allowed to physically have it. Because there is a there is also under the under the colds if
there is a civil disaster anybody can operate that a ham radio license you don't need a you don't
need a license to operate if it's a license like or death situation. Okay theoretically in those
situations you could use it but I also know from some guys that they are monitoring actively
monitoring the the airways and if you are broadcasting without a license there was a guy he got
was it 10 something around just picking numbers here something like either 15,000 of a fine
his he got his and it was going to go up to some outrageous number if he if he did it for a second
it was going to be a hundred and twenty thousand euros for the second offense. So they're not
messing about. They're not messing about. I'll promise to record a show about that as well but I
knew. I'll just give you my rundown on this entire series it's been absolutely brilliant they
they walked through and everything has just shed loads and loads and loads of light on stuff that
I had heard about like Squelch and didn't really understand it but yeah it's absolutely been very
very helpful this whole series and we're going. Yeah I just wanted to say I think I already said
in previous ones that I was enjoying the much more than I thought it would and he's doing a great
job of explaining everything going through in in such detail is brilliant. I'm always tempted
for such an amazing little device for each 20 quid or something. You know why wouldn't you get one
they're not that expensive right I mean if you get afforded if you get afforded obviously fine but
if you if you could afford it you'll have grabbed one of them and you'll get a in the UK the
technician there's even an entry-level technician license which is like unbelievably easy to do
and then you're you're up and going and you can you can talk to local repeaters and stuff so you know
you know when there's when there's umby's arrived Dave you're really thanking me yeah. It's
absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah I've got a lot of cricket bats as well I can't show no to the dead
it's a wonderful thing yeah okay following day we've had 23.08 every day package operations in
can you say this word geeks that's the one geeks clacky going through this geeks he's determined
that everybody uses this yeah satisfied until he has taken over control of the world
it does sound quite tempting I must say I'm just essentially lazy and don't don't want to change but
does does sound pretty pretty cool he's talking about that I can't I'm also in play I'm tempted to do
it for for things where you're managing distributed environments um so I can't help but be thinking
about this as a solution for some of the stuff that I'm doing in other places which I may or may not
be doing chores on there yeah it certainly sounds like an interesting way of of of managing and
an operating system so maybe it's right it will take over the world so comments I left a comment
about about uh constantly submitted the show he had that there was no intro but there was no
that can't be right so uh but I listened and he had a a new hpura theme done so that's up there cool
I think it did a great job actually I liked that very much he uh his uh whistling and singing
of the of the theme was was a gem I see you captured it yeah it's awesome anybody can submit
uh outros all you want so long as they there's even a write-off about how the theme song what it
needs to be so cool so clack it says theme song cool I can see it's linked and it gives the
the URL of where you've put the the the the thing it's not live yet and then he comes back
comment three and says oh it's there now it's a great thing so he's obviously happy that his
his efforts have gone gone up there for permanent he's now he's now in the big time the royalty
checks will be rolling in be easy said GNU store please I would love to hear an episode of
owns GNU store I hear good things about it but haven't tried it I would love to hear how your
use of it and clack it comes back and says GNU snow see I've got a touch of it now GNU
stow in the pipeline GNU stow show oh he's done that deliberately is in the pipeline
pipeline visible and then he's he's got a an URL where he keeps his various uh show intentions
no promises on ETA in what order I decided to tackle these subjects the one I'm working on now
is the history of video envelope formats will be so I would just like to say this every single
one of those is is an you all me a show clack it every single hashtag up there thank you very much
what I think he's actually I think he's committing there in public so why would he do that
has he never listened to the community news anyway speaking of longstanding members of the community
John Colp dragging sometime crowdsourcing accessibility and very very nice show about getting his
lectures transcribed very good yeah yeah an interesting idea I thought and I like the fact that
you can you can effectively get bribe people I was because you could tell I was choosing my words
camp I won't there Dave but no it's it's great that he can do this and it's great I do the only one
thing I was thinking about with the MP MP3 split which is very good to have used it before but
it does tend to be very brutal with it's cutting off so it will cut off right in the middle of
like that exact second it'll it'll just cut it off so I would have thought to leave leave a overlap
of you know five seconds either side or ten seconds either side so that you could hear multiple
segments but I guess you could always click the one you know that he has a play button so you could
click the minutes previous of the minute after to get the full segments but that's just an observation
yeah yeah it's I got a digitized vinyl record that sounded for me he's got got my old record
collection plus turn table and he sent it so I tried trying to drive up into tracks I couldn't
find a simple way of doing other than just going into audacity and slicing where it looked like
it need to be sliced so there is a in audacity there is a somebody has done a show Dave and
remember at the time thinking did we or did we not say this very thing that we would I have a
archive project ahead where I want to do that very thing and there was some way to split up
the audacity show notes if I can plug it yeah okay well some years back now I didn't remember it
but it wasn't it was just doing one side of an LP was not too bad but there's a there's a bunch
of others coming when he's he's got the time to do it for me so yeah it would be nice to at least
give me some hints automatically rather than me having to hunt through it yep so you said hi John
a most interesting project with an ingenious solution I like bio can you read your
I like blow the language was the word that he he mentioned on the show I like it too and investigating
it's etymology I found an article on word worldwide words I tongue's not working tonight
where I often go for information on unusual words I found this which you might like and they give
him a URL on the weird words and I would use three John's comments for the exact same reason
so on the article it mentioned Gloviate which is a sort of made up word effectively and along
with it it mentioned some others so John came back and said absquatulate great page I like the
reference to the following words as well suck dolegia horn swaggle and absquatulate gotta start
using those so I can I know she works suck dolegia means actually horn swaggle used to hear horn swaggle
on cowboy films and stuff I remember that you two time in horn swaggle and absquatulate just
means to go away um some joke on you know you're you're squatting down so you gotta stop doing it
and go away type of thing I think yeah they say it's a great it's a great word I still think we
should have like a and to entomology is that word they're not compared to knowledge that's the
money excellent good stuff anyone who wants to start a series feel free to do so thank you very
much hpr 23 10 kdn live part six workflow and conclusion and I would just like to thank
Gettys personally for doing such an excellent job on that and I would like to thank
uh Seth Kennan for writing the article in the first place I think this was one of the best um
best drink best examples that I have of uh the creative commons working to full effect to
to very competent people and their own right doing justice to the to the work so big comes up
from me yeah it's really good as you say very well read and an excellent article telling me things
I never knew I needed to know yeah exactly all those things about I don't know uh cutting room floor
and you know gold uh uh different releases directors cause and all that sort of stuff excellent
so the following day we had another in the series of the bolfang uh handset and then the day after
that we had troubleshooting websites with x amp I would never have thought to use this and this
is by frank and that's a patchy Maria db php and pearl and while he was describing this I was
thinking you know actually that is a very good idea because I quite often um do need to troubleshoot
some of these uh you know these shared hosting uh places and I just do it live on the box and
that has been my demise on a few occasions I must what's confessed yeah it does it does seem like
a good way of sending things up in a sort of um sandboxed uh system to to to check it out and
and see how it behaves never had a need to do that really but uh it's uh it's there's always
going to be a time when you you find you do something like this is be good to refer back to yep
excellent uh keep them coming frank good to hear them back then we had I mean
chat to you talking about nil fs 2 I had no clue that this existed and was found at a very
interesting uh very interesting common topic as did forky thank you for a good show really like to
test uh nil fs myself could you write down some examples please yeah yeah it's I knew nothing
of it absolutely nothing of it I was quite surprised that it was already on my
my desktop machine um so yeah so it's something I want to go and investigate at very least some
point so yeah excellent yeah with file systems I'm very happy to let other people do the investigation
and then when all that's uh all that's done then come back and try it on something non-critical
yeah yeah I know it's it's uh I don't have an immediate application but I bet it would be fun
to play with on a Raspberry Pi for example yeah so that would be something just to think of
following day bad caps in my bill talking about repairing a computer's motherboard and uh basically
he was able to fix it by replacing uh crappy capacitors and this is the second show that we've had
Dave where um bad capacitors were the source of problems and people uh fixed it by fixing the caps
yeah yeah it's it's a thing to look for I think isn't it I uh do you know what
I did do you ever hear about the calls of that I think I heard on big clive or was this uh julian
julian uh iliad julian il yes i al e t t how would you pronounce that
yes i let yeah i let yeah he has a um yeah he was he was recommended he was on the big clive.com
um they did they they collaborate on on a thingy and then I went back and watched all his videos
and I'm he produces a north a lot of videos and I have not caught up yet but he was saying
I just posted that there into the chapter so you can go to his youtube channel
anyway he was saying that there was a few years back um a bad run of capacitors on and that they
some major manufacturer made a lot of dug capacitors that went after a year and a half two years
in service they basically uh the electric light dried up and they had to basically replace them
and uh so somebody else either him or somebody else was saying that the very very first thing
you should do if there's a repair is look at the capacitors and see if there if there are any domes
on them and then just replace all capacitors on the board and you're more than likely going to be
able to fix the device whatever device it is yeah for that too um people that throw away monitors
and TVs and stuff it's often uh some replacement capacitors will solve the solve the problem
electrolytics as you say as you can see see when they go usually yeah I I had um my previous uh
workstation had a graphics card in it which suddenly went pop literally one day and that was all
I don't know quite why but it was all of the they're pretty much all the capacitors on it all the
electrolytics had blown and the lids were off um I didn't repair it I just got another one because
it's because uh it's time for not varied anyway but you know you could as you say it's pretty easy
to see what's wrong and uh to to fix it possibly yeah so interesting interesting I wouldn't have
I wouldn't have considered repairing it up until now but uh now that I've um watched lots of videos
and got myself a soldering iron and listen to Mr X's soldering show um absolutely no reason
why you couldn't try onion it's not going to get any more broken and if it does you're going to
have some fun broken unit broken yeah yeah my there's a thing I have pending which is to
try and get my old BBC micro back on to back working again and the thing that fails on them
is the power supply goes and it's the electrolytics I mean they'll be dried out and and rubbish anyway
even if they haven't popped so you just go go through the board and replace them all um and
they're usually quite big so they're usually quite easy to solder so yeah yeah I think those boards
pretty easy to desolder and uh and remove whereas uh N.Y. Bill's mother board was a bit more
difficult to do with yep so do you want to read your comment? I said thanks for this very
interesting show as always the issue of the type of solder used on motherboards like this is something
I've never heard about before that means my recently born Chinese hako clone soldering station will
not handle it I guess time for a cheap hot air gun perhaps also my knowledgeic fastest is at
1960s school physics level so hearing more about what's out there now um was fascinating
more shows like this would be most welcome and N.Y. Bill recommended to me a good podcast on
electronics which I will just pause and get for you yep it's called the spark gap podcast with
Karl and Corey so spark gap podcast and then there are guys had a yep they have done
several shows about capacitors so basically you know they uh seems to be an electronics meme that
no matter what problem there is it can be fixed by uh electronic capacitor by adding more
by adding more capacitors to any electronics project and they had a guy on called James
Lewis Lewis from uh current net electronics to talk about capacitors in episode 25 so very good
sure they don't really shows very often but they're quite good okay thank you that's worth a check
so and my bill replied to you hey Dave I grew up in the 1970s I'm not sure you can tell me to get
off your lawn okay maybe you can but I'll definitely stand at the edge shaking fist joking aside
a lot of solder these days is going lead free the stuff being used these has a higher melting point
this can be an issue sometimes with like uh with something like a motherboard it's densely packed
has multiple layers all of these layers can dissipate the heat you're trying to apply to one
component sit there too long and you start damaging things next to the component you're trying to
replace you need to get in heat something up quickly get out the hot air station did the trick however
it was an edge case for me I get by by just my soldering pen 99% at the time that's quite interesting
actually yeah I'd I've not really had dealings with things at that level of sophistication
just simple played it through stuff you know it's all I have ever really done so
some interesting points there although he was saying there's a big clive.com have you you follow
that's oh I do I'm watching him every day pretty much he often goes all about how much he hates
the lead free solder and the oh I never use it I don't use it I've got some and I hate it and so I've
got loads tons of more than I'm ever going to use of old fashioned lead solder he also when he's
removing stuff he'll tin us with the lead solder and let it get mixed and then slurp up both yeah
yep that's that's a good thing because it does get a bit more flux into the thing anyway so that
helps so Jonathan and Colt replied um to uh join the the discussion comment number three
the suspense is killing me he says come on man don't leave us hanging did it work to which I
replied hey my bill to reply to that needs to show in the cell and sure oh I'm lost on his number
five John says I'll I'll do his show next time in that case maybe next time I should do a 30-second
episode where I ask Bill whether it worked or not how does that sound can it sounds absolutely
awesome John because we all know Jonathan Colt can't do a 30-second show never going to happen
no no he suffers from the same thing I do yeah and my bill says so I did the last one
of it never mind hey John had the motherhood in my backpack fixed for two months the episodes
recording started quite a while ago I plan to give thing back to Marcus when I saw him turns out
his quit his job here in New York and gone back to Florida I talked with him in a scene he told
me to use it will give it to somebody else in the lug I would have to pull apart one of my two
desktops to test it we'll see so we don't know actually now my bill do not reply in the comments what
how the taskmaster can cracks the HPR whip great idea that would make two more shows excellent
so in the following day pengalcon 2017 report look forward to these every year actually it's nice
and as who cares last year has been the tech event organizer for that yes yes it's it's a shame
well I mean I think you know you do a few years and then you want to try something something
else yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's just been interesting to hear his insight as an organizer so
it's being selfish saying that I know but still cool I'm not sure that he'll still give us the
reviews of yeah just just realize that I was that he'd said that he's he's I think he's already
got his ticket for the next one perhaps he said he's only going to go to these in the future so
knowing him he'll be he'll be telling us about it so the next day was part six of the
bovine nice thing and then we had oh my god Dave this one I needed a several cups of coffee
bash snippets ext love and secure copy how does secure copy manage to extend love patterns
yeah right right i'm not saying that in a bad way i'm saying that in a this was now this is what
happens when you when you do like I say and actually answer people's comments which is you go down
the rabbit hole but it's actually interesting because it did explain to me a lot of things that
I've come across in in the past and it gave logical reasons for why it would happen yeah I hadn't
appreciated how this worked it was it was partly John culp saying you know what's what's happening
and in his in his show he he but oh yeah it was it was him commenting on a show of mine I think
wasn't yeah he was he was struggling with this and he and then Clackick mentioned that he was
surprised what he could see of the way SCP worked and that intrigued me a lot I had to go and find
out more about it and you did yes you did there will be this will be one of these bookmarked by
a very very small number of people who will be very very grateful to you you could just you know
I know actually the use case where I came across this where you have servers on the inside of
of a zone with a one-way connection out are you going through a particular machine and that
machine only has like basic secured lockdown applications on it there's no arsenic there's no
the only thing you have in your arsenal is secure copy and these people will be thanking you grateful
greatly when they read this and figure out exactly what is going on
yes don't be afraid to do these shows it's an odd thing no I find it enormously intriguing to
find out how these work and there's a sort of stubborn determination to try and find out why
it doesn't do what I think it ought to do I would have given up a way before before this did I
hear in that show that you opened up some source code to see what happened I did I went and got
the source code of SCP and poked around in it to see if I could find out what why it was doing
the thing it did so this is well you know how this is that we do for you here on HPR folks
and you know last month you were commenting about why I do the iron and board shows yeah
can you imagine you host coming along thinking this is the level of detail that they need to go
to to be opening up the source code to secure copy this is why I have to do these shows Dave I
have to lower the barrier okay okay okay I get it no I'm actually you're professionally really
glad that you did that because it is it is an edge case but it's an edge case that I have come
across several times in my career and it had bugged me but I've worked around it either by manually
doing manually setting up a script to copy one type first and then the next type next and
but it's it's been frustrating not knowing why but I've never had the patience to actually
go and figure it out so thank you very much for that really welcome so do you want me to do
update both these comments I'll read Jonathan's one okay well sort of thanks for the follow-up
episode Dave I think I understand I think I understand it better now but I might not just one of
those things you know and I said clear as MIRTH smiley face hi John I hope it helped if only a
little I look quite carried away by the investigation and perhaps shouldn't have brain dumped it all
into an episode it was quite fun though no I think that one as I said will be locked away and of
ex again on Hacker Hover Radio if I can imagine the number of likes on this would be quite minimal
but the people who did like it or really really really did like it okay I'm not making any sense but
I hope you understand what I think I know what you mean yeah thinking about my think pads and this
was Swift 110 and wow there must be a lot of think pads in the states especially if you can get
them so cheap in in goodwill stores yeah yeah yeah it's I don't know how common they are here
but I don't see them anywhere over here it's mostly Delts and HPs my son's girlfriend
needed a new old laptop old new laptop to you since she's a doctor so she's in working in
the hospital at the moment she needs someone she could easily lug around there and she got her
and I still will think pad so yeah it's beautiful little machine I mean they are they're all really
all really sturdy and solid and beautiful yeah yeah very nice clunky box you put the good perhaps
but just nice technical feel too anyway good show next day we had a minimal music site available on
source forge and a rundown of his new machine and I very much got the feeling that this was of course
from Mac King USA sharing some tech like that I had the feeling yeah the joy of explaining
hey look guys I got this sometimes you're excited about tech and there's nobody around to talk
to about it that will understand the level of excitement and I did understand the level of
excitement so I was right with you and more people should do that if your spouse or kids are not
as super thrilled about the raspberry pie zero that comes in feel free to do a show over here just
telling us about how excited you are about getting your new kit yeah absolutely absolutely now I
fully sympathize with that and the minimal music site is is actually a great project but he
should have some screenshots or demos or something up there because I had to go back and look at
the previous episode that he did in order to remind myself what the music what he was trying to do
with the minimum music site which is a great little project I went and visited the the link he has
in the in the show notes but wasn't entirely clear what under what circumstances I would want to
use it but yeah I'm missing some information there this thing in just of having a minimal music site
for for the songs that I've collected from other talks talks jam or cc hits or Dave the
broadcast you know I have a collection of no several hundred songs and you know just nice music
pop it up there and then you could hear it that's a good idea yeah yeah yeah well it's it's
it seemed like a nice project the way he was describing it sounded if you put a lot of thought
into it and written some some clever stuff there so yeah it's on sourceboards yeah so we could go
and look at the source if we want to so yeah cool so we had the next day show JWP living computer
museum and lab was not aware of this very good idea I like it very much and you commented on
this was fascinating yeah I love hearing about that I said well the first thing he mentioned
the the orcs series so I said orcs series and deck hardware I JWP most interesting show I'd love
to visit that museum thanks to the mention the orcs series here on HBR I should point out
that it's a joint series being produced by Be Easy and myself the next episode is in early July
I did I did screen down the the train when I heard that one so it's a monastic
no no no it's it I was the last one to maybe the last one to do one so yeah yeah but but
it be easy episodes coming up so I said I was delighted to hear you talk about digital
equipment corporation known as deck I spent a good bit of my work life managing deck wax cluster
running open the ms this was the system used by students and stuff at the university where I
worked we also had two alpha servers there later one running open the ms and the other digital
units I thought deck stuff was great he mentioned waxes and open the ms and an alpha server so I
mentioned it back I've used a used deck stuff in the past yes it was great for it's time it was
it was brilliant tool yeah it was a great operating system and much of the I many of the ideas in
it went off to to to be used in other things all of the deck people who had written the ms and
built the the clustering capabilities which were which were groundbreaking went off to work
for Microsoft so quite a lot what turned into the various versions of Windows came from people
with an open vms experience that's the classic where windows nt comes from is the vms one later on
vms wnt yep yep yep we know yeah you could run windows on the alpha servers too the yeah exactly
this that they were we never did but you could do if you wanted to and bjb did a show on virtual
end wrapper and this was explaining the environmental process and this also clarified and all
a lot of stuff that I was never really completely 100% able to understand you know get my head
round although I think the show what also yeah Linux processes via wrapper and Linux process of
a good show title I think we skipped over mr x's bow thing by the way oh yeah sorry about parts
haven't yes parts of but yes I think we said it just goes on and on giving um they just just
to mention on that one the ctcs business absolutely boggle my mind and I'm sorry this is they
does on the radio thing where they have multiple people on the same frequency
and they can tune out others because of the underlying tone that's on there yeah I never really
understood how that worked no I never knew it existed and so I didn't and but I heard that in taxi
cabs where you'd suddenly where you would hear delivery people you just cut off the last little bit
you would hear cut off at the end of the transmission yeah it's amazing the internet is that's
gone into running all this stuff over over radio is amazing yeah exactly that's why you know
when the more I'm studying ham radio and stuff the more you know you ask somebody about
ham radio can you teach us ham radio and then the natural thing is what we don't know where to start
because there are so many facets of it it's very similar I think to the way people say
um oh yeah you're into computers my husband's into computers or my girlfriend's into computers
yes okay but that doesn't really give the the same then then diagram is quite large if you know what I mean
oh yes I'm just going to you overlapped an interest no no no it's the same in many many walks of
life isn't it yeah so yeah that was that I found that one particularly interesting intriguing and
interesting I think that's a brilliant idea just in general I know we've been we've been
waffling on about how excellent these shows have been but the idea of gone through a menu of
of a device like that is just an awesome awesome thing indeed so back to two three two two virtual
in wrapper are you sure this eh sounds like you're doing a skipping roll for something
of course of course yeah I like to get in trim while I'm doing this see the problem with
where I'm doing this recording is in the extension I've got in my house and that's where the cat
tensing out and she was just doing a thing she's just using her litter tray
do you really want to know oh that's for sure so yeah there are noises off
and the neighbor's dog as you heard earlier on keep trying to net and have a bit of a bark and
so on and so forth so yeah yeah it's all all human life is here do you have like
raspberry pide are do you know also washing detectors a little less no not not down here I did it
at one point I was trying to watch the the bird feeder out there but there are as you
pides not really up to I need to get an enclosure and put it beside it and watch them there
it's a project for later in one day yep yep yep yep yep but an excellent first show yeah really
well done I thought and it the notes were brilliant and the content was was really good I thought
the explanation of environment variables was really really good and clarified so much stuff to
me that I could never really understand and never really put the effort into figuring it out either
I I knew this I mean I did know this but I had never explained it in any of my talks on bash and
stuff and I don't think I would have put it in the way that she did and I don't think I would have
done it as well actually so so thank you very much for that contribution to the the world of
bash and all that stuff yep and the easy says great show might follow up to come thanks for
an excellent show I learned a lot about the underpinnings behind python virtual environments
and how programs like virtual and wrapper exploits them you have inspired me to create a follow-up
episode about how I create a virtual environment wrapper like experience for the fish shell I don't
know about you Dave but that sounds like you owe me a show right there well as I understand it
that show appeared in the in the pending queue within within a day I think and very soon if it's
on the server it's a show indeed indeed you mean the word that's what I like it definitely definitely
not like these scumbags who say they're going to do shows and then don't for 10 years
I don't know which people don't know you could possibly talk about it yes I show within a show
metal configure mumble in real time a very subtle advertising attempt to point to you random
show yeah we know what you're up to we know what they're at good for them are guys are all good
guys over there that is a that's a show I've been meaning to put in the feed but every time they
every time I want to pick a show that would be a sample show they go mentioning certain people
on how so I skipped that Suzycon 2017 Ubuntu 1604 this is JWPs one of our nice about H top
and I've basically run down of the various different systems and OS is in a much memory
that's it yes yes these these are good yeah never a port to go to Suzycon though then again I probably
can go to a distro only thing I've never really got into Suzy anyway it there was a department in
university I worked out that we're running it exclusively but I've never really done much with
myself but good to to know more about it actually and Ogre did a show about insurance health
insurance specifically and how it works in the U.S. at least so yes I made a comment shall I read
that one you should and see when when did he make the comment Dave he went back in time he has
the time machine he's doing that thing oh we we strongly tried to prevent oh no we didn't we put
the shows up and you can look at them ahead of time if you want to so you know where you can set up
your speed to pull them down so you get very confusing for the old people yeah yeah yeah yeah
did I miss a show yes it's strange to get comments that appear in the following month sometimes
when I'm processing them and then I thought I just approved that comment where did it go oh it's
gone into next month slot so yeah so he said great show thanks for this overview of the underlying
issues as a point of reference Sweden used to have full government funding and government
provision of services except for dental care when we have private providers these days all types
of services follow the dental care model a patient can choose where to go and the government
insurance encodes pace for the services it's called an insurance but it's paid through the
employment tax and the premium is determined entirely by the salary you can also add a private
healthcare insurance and get access to further clinics and services shorter queues etc counties
license providers so while so while in some sense anybody qualified to provide services can do so
each county may uphold each a certain quota of private versus public providers okay
okay that's okay it's actually quite good to if we could get people to do shows on how
I think it's always good to look at other systems because what might be obvious to you might
be obvious to everybody else which would make this you question your own assumptions which is always
a good thing well I wrote notes to myself on this one try and wipe why to tell myself to try and
wipe my prejudices about this away and start from from a position of balance it if at all possible
which I like to learn a bit more about it and balance these things out cool so what's up now
mailing this discussions shall we do those we've got or shall we do comments first let's
comments comments that were so why are these colored Dave especially for us what are you doing here
the colors the colors going to get removed oh no leave the colors go live well the idea was that
it was basically for me because I forget which ones we've read the previous month and so I
worked out that if they if the posting date of the comment preceded the the last recording date
then we would have read it so I marked these intending that we shouldn't read them again on this show
so why do you put them in oh because they have to go somewhere they have to go somewhere yeah yeah
that's exactly yeah well you could have like already discussed in the previous show
yeah yeah a bit of color it was nice so it probably it probably won't work on the on internet
archive actually because I used a bit of CSS to color it so they strip out any any CSS I think
on the way in I don't think people will be as anxious as you get it no no no nobody will give it
a rat so why don't you recall it one way or the other so I was going to switch it off before I
got these go live so in fact we shouldn't even talk about it if there was only a way to remove
that whole conversation from the show but as everybody knows I do not edit
it right Bob Youngman said in relation to a mirror shades show and the Tashiba liberal
100 CT show 2187 dated last December a quick and dirty way to find dead pixels is depressed the
LCD screen as you described but apply the pressure when you power it on I'm not sure what happens
but sometimes it seems to fuse in place and the pixel works again don't know if it'll work on an
entire column of pixels good tip nice to know wow yeah yeah yeah I wonder how that works fascinating
so the next one was on some supplementary bash tips by Dave Morris which was the one where you
were talking about um this is all the x glob and yes that's that one that one yeah so yeah yeah
exactly I start yeah yeah I've actually gotten these on I've actually got these on on a tab on
on another screen yeah just to confuse me even more so yeah are you you're doing shows about this
so if I'm I refuse to read these on the grounds that they should be shows and this point was made up
what a waste of a show this my comment comment seven after what is essentially three pages
of show notes goes flying past between the two of you so uh he's added it to his show note thing
so it's essentially yeah let's suggest that we scheme but there is there is a comment number three
was he was asking how people record which was which was which which is probably worth mentioning
because it's probably probably a thing that the others would like to contribute to and maybe
how people record it would be interesting to have an overview of how people various people choose
to prepare and record their episodes for newcomers to get some idea of what might suit them the
way I've done it recently is to write the show notes and while I do so basically play in my head
what I will say about them and then come up with side tracks I ought to provide references to
etc I don't rehearse and lately I haven't cut anything out either earlier I've cut my episodes a bit
because I'd gone off track or there was too much ambit noise when I've been walking but now I'm
aiming for a little threshold as possible before I publish I had that one episode that I procrastinated
for a year because I wanted to edit it down for length finally I just published it
worse it's better for me anyway Dave so only enemy on hbr is procrastination I've said it before
and I said again actually I've never said it before but procrastination is the impossibly it's best
friend perfection those are the two killers here yeah yeah well you write him on both cats I think
I've got a huge backlog of things that I tend to do and haven't done yet yeah but you're working
through them at least you know quite often I've heard you know people have come on
no it doesn't happen so much now because of our you know if it's not a show it's not on the server
but in the in the past you get people saying oh I'm going to do a show or I'm going to do a series
on this and you know you just never hear the shows or the series again because yeah they're
they're putting it's too much effort you know we need to have shows coming through yeah and
great if you can put that effort in and some some holes do put in the effort and produce high quality
audio all the time and if you want to start off producing crappy audio or working well to
producing good audio we can do that too but remember it will never be perfect so yeah go for
which is why I've got iron and board episodes Dave although I will refuse to throw my
knot in the earbud down as one of those shows because everybody knows my patent is sooner or later
going to get applied I'm looking forward to seeing the scene the paint just the diagrams and which
way do you tie the knot and which hand you use to do it oh yeah it's going to be great so I did
answer that business about recording but yeah go ahead and rebuild should I do it should I do it
on recording I said I also like to prepare notes first and as soon as possible after they're
done record that way the the ideas are all fresh on my mind I use the notes as a structure
but mostly ad lib the audio reading the notes is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned
since the first HBR show I did not I did I do not rehearse it's guy write some weird sentences
uh in a Oxford comedy sometimes I do remember but I know about an Oxford comedy
I think we need a show on that can anyway um years ago I'd gone into reminiscing mode here at late
97 years to teach evening classes in and have our education center Pascal and basic I've
evolved similar style there and constructed notes which became handouts for the students
amusingly they were printed on a line printer that would be seen to mind actually and I'd
written down my I read my own text processors to generate them so you know geek or yes
exactly as toward your editing I do edit I hesitate and I'm an a lot and deal with these by
light silence truncation and removal of a proportion of I'm an ear patterns I can edit a lot
faster than I've been when I started but it's just a personal foible without editing I find my
audio irritating to listen to and assume others will too nope um yeah each to their own um I tend to
either do uh write the show notes first like in a pop and then you know like a presentation but a
point thing and then just add lib it uh and sometimes I will go around just go for a walk with my
MP3 player on record and then talk to myself and then actually not use that because then once I've
spoken it out loud I'll come back and do a clean recording but quite often what happens is if I
start and press record and it doesn't go right on the first take then it'll be 35 takes later
and it just gets immensely frustrating at that point yeah yeah right yes it's uh anyway
it's it's I think there's mileage in getting to do shows yeah this mileage in getting more I would
have thought and uh just about the other comments uh are about the use of echoes and stuff which
we'll be hearing a shows about which is good yeah yep crackers committed to um to doing a show on
print F so have a good so skipping over the shows that we're not allowed to talk about because we
spoke about them last month we're on to desperately seeking saving RMS and this was um this was the
show about Dododomi trying to uh move over to more NURMS ideal and RTSN says great episode
I'm looking forward to hearing more from you on this interesting project so the following comment
was on Hana from Arch on Celeste by Hana of Stereo of Sol still an awesome a awesome um handle and she
puts in a link to the repo for that and RTSN says good interesting episode you have a great voice
for podcasting for sure looking forward to hearing more shows from you in the future big thumbs up
from people there you still around Dave yes yes uh you you seem to be uh forging ahead then so I
just I shall forge ahead Dave to Dave Lee's comment on more Magnetune's favorites uh show by Dave
the man Morris uh Dave Lee says CC license and subscription model still listening to the show
actually only started this after doing CC licenses are irrevocable which was something I didn't
also you mentioned anime amni magnetunes changed their subscription model is this why you can
to sign up for monthly anymore to which Dave replied so thanks I said thanks Dave your comment on
the lighting issue is useful I was confused by the fact that Magnetune offer commercial licenses
by subscription and I give a note you are able to it about the license for non-commercial uses
creative commons by NCSA which I now understand is perpetual I didn't know that before I
shared it was useful to know the subscription model has changed in the very earliest days there
was several and you could buy individual albums including on cd I have a few myself I think a
monthly all you can eat subscription followed that I was a monthly subscriber for many years and
finally about five years ago they changed to only offering a lifetime subscription I imagine this
significantly reduced their overheads there's a blog where their business model has been
discussed for example and give a pointer to John Buckman's blog where he's he's talked about his
business model so hopefully that answers Dave's question yeah and I did not know that about the
licenses uh very interesting to know yeah yeah Dave's obviously very knowledgeable on this
well he would be being the man behind the bug cast indeed so now we do the the mail and indeed
there's a warning behind the book cast as well yes and they're they're both going to be at
a certain bug pot crawl oh I can't get over to that it's just too expensive Dave sorry
sorry why do you do this why do you put shows and out of the way hard to reach places
yeah great sir great sir Glasgow will be expensive to get to
as well Scotland because they festivals coming up and schools of just our
parents will be whizzing around whether the place etc etc so should we do the thread archive thread
go yes go for yes I see the first was the discussion okay that was me waiting for the for the
clicked link to come up okay go on and you go yeah about the the guys are trying to put together
the next ham radio roundtable episode and they're just doing some discussions about that if you
want to join the HPR ham radio roundtable then the suggestion is that it's 2017 0614 and 1800
which has already occurred do you know if it went ahead Dave I've had nothing about it to be honest
no I hadn't spotted the the the time in combat oh they changed the time to 1830 I think yeah that's
weird I hadn't I honestly hadn't noticed that okay cool um then we jj wp was was asking about last
months recording and thank you sir I think he'd missed the email it actually transpired that he was on
the digest form of the HPR mailing list so although we got an answer to his question very quickly
he didn't notice it because the the digest had not yet been formed and and sent out so so
that caused a little bit of a problem but we managed to resolve it yeah and I have some strange
happenings where my anything come from hacker public radio is put into my spam folder and I
contacted the admin about it and it's now on a white list but today I saw that it's not still
not receiving all they update so not very happy about all of that so the next topic was a
community using user coding schedule which we had to shift because I have something on tomorrow
and there was a discussion then from Bob Young's man that we should do a iCal calendar which I
think is a brilliant idea and Dave claims that I said no it was a stupid idea and I should
put it on the website Dave so I said I did say in my email to you here's the thing and I think
which would be on the website I don't think you actually answered so it may not answer it is not
so yeah I think I think because Bob's got Bob's point was that if you do that then you can simply
subscribe to that calendar and then if you change it if we change it then your subscription gets
updated automatically which is fantastic idea I haven't quite thought that one through myself so
it's good to have his input there yeah let's make that happen somehow I shouldn't be too too
to but we just need to decide where to put it and put it there yeah no we can put it in we can put
it on to the website but we can also put it into any time as the community news show that you
are linked instantaneously to the link and that the link is in the rss feed and the show notes
yep yep so do you want to talk about the pop crawl yes well yes I put and some any other business in
this these particular notes but it's also comes up in the mailing list so I didn't want it to
to full flat we are having the pod crawl glass go or Glasgow pod crew which is when you
want to call it and it's happening next month opens tab to find it next month which is given
that we're recording in the on the last day of June it's probably not going to be that helpful
to people it's Saturday July the 29th at 6 p.m. starting in the state bar Holland street Glasgow
where it's been for for a number of years and it's start there and then go on to wherever I linked
to kevys blog where he talks about all of the details including the the business about
children not really being allowed in pubs in in Scotland but yeah it's pretty much covered
there so hopefully we'll we'll see some hbr listeners and contributors along there we're
we're expecting kevys from tuxjam mcnello from tuxjam and both from hbr as well I think we're
expecting davley and caroline from the bug cast and we're expecting andru whose name I've
forgotten from lex voice and tux radar what's his second name I was terrible with names can't
remember anyway he's coming excellent and I would love to go just a bit of her sitting in a
pub is it conducive to conversation it's not too bad the state bar is not particularly busy
pub we do and we don't go to the noisy ones I've never actually seen the whole
crawl out till one or two o'clock in the morning I'd sooner go home got my bed on that age but
but I think we try very very hard to avoid the the noisy pubs so it's all you know it's
older sort of wood paneled old geezer type places yeah I know everybody turns around to walk in
why does that appeal to me yes yes there's certainly the ones with rope on row different whiskeys
across the wall and that sort of thing nothing wrong with us this was no no no no low whiskeys very good
yes um should we skip over the community news dialogue because I think that was uh that was
covered there was it yeah the the only other thing which again comes up in the in the
any business was martial tim to me commenting uh in the third of the community news that he's got
the hpr uk table kit and wondered he's not going to be able to go to all camp wondered if anybody
else was and who he should send it to to uh set up an hpr table so uh don't think it's going to be
an hpr presence there this year which is a pity I really like to get more involvement on get the
tables going again because they they have done more to promote the network than anything else
I feel yeah I think you're right get us out there it's certainly in the my experience of the
table to og camp a lot of people express interest in who hpr is and what we do it's
often great surprise that that it exists and and there's been going for so long and so and then
there's the you know the promises of oh I shall be be sending you in a show and not always
producing anything but now we've had a few we have had them yeah have had them yeah
a few yep okay um kubnu sent in trouble with the admin account yep um the admin account is a
redirection and the spam checker checks to see if there's an actual account there and returns this
isn't an actual account and then you get a meal thinking that you haven't um you get a response
saying that you haven't it hasn't been delivered to an unnatural fact it has
so I'm thinking of turning that into a real account Dave what do you think well that would help
just so we could share the password then yeah yeah yeah but I think I don't know how these things
are implemented but I think that um it'll it'll be an alias list um an empty yeah it isn't
but the the issue is that the mail server uh the the mail transport agent um checks to see if the
actual if there's a natural user on the hpr server called admin and if there isn't then this message
is sent out yeah yeah but it could also be the list it could probably also be the list as well
as they're being an actual account yeah yeah I think I don't know if I can have a look at it
some experimentation yeah but uh yeah but yeah I think that that would it would be nice to stop
that because it's really throwing people yeah they get an error message back and then there was
also some issues with slow downloads um and uh Josh traced that down today to it was slow
downloads and bringing down the website as well um and it traced down to somebody downloading
shows uh all the archive and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that that's the that's what
it's there for but please do it one show at a time there's no reason to like bombard our uh bombard
they um server this server has been provided to us free of charge by an honest host.com and we take
down several terabytes uh all bandwidth and several several terabytes of space you're more than uh
you're more than uh you're more than welcome to take down the shows to download them uh archive
shows especially but uh go to the archive uh page and there's a script that will download
them one at a time and you'll get them as fast as you would if you're doing them in parallel
it's just a little bit rude because you're you know knocking down somebody's website uh especially
when that somebody's trying to make it live enough the other users that are on the on the website
there okay very good point go to the hall and think about what you've done
yeah yeah and it was it was great of Josh to come back with with such a good explanation as well
I really appreciate it exactly yeah it's a nice guy and we should thank Josh again for um given us
this resource here um cause he's uh yeah he's paying for this out of his own pocket if you
want to know who pays for hpr the vast majority of the of the uh costs would be for us hosting all
this bandwidth and stuff and Josh pays for that um with his company anonasthost.com and we have a
15% discount available to you not only is he going to give you reliable honest hosting where he will
tell you exactly what's going on uh you will get a 15% discount as well on all shared hosting with
the off-record hpr 15 that's hpr 15 where we heard about that that's ringing a bell within
that share heard that before someone but we might do something about that um for pushing people
over toarkive.org because those people are also greatfully hosting our shows um and they are
they're getting funding um you know and donations and stuff and they have uh infrastructure spread
across the globe in order to be able to facilitate that so if you did want to download our
shows you can get them from there just a song as somebody's put all the shows up there Dave huh huh
how are you getting going with that? Quite a lot of them are up there actually can't
necessarily it's about uh well about 1400 are up then now I think I've not actually polished
and must say if you happen gone to um archive.org and our page over there it's extremely polished
you should be commended for the work you're doing over there Dave. Well thank you very much.
I think you are commended. There's there's more there's more to be done um but uh yeah there's there's
not more to be uploaded but um yeah the the uploading process would be as helped quite a lot if
we had a bit more help on the the tags and stuff of course. Really like to add tags to shows as they
go up they don't have them. They're the older shows because the internet archive has some brilliant
searching capabilities based around what they called subject and we called tags and uh it seems
such a shame not to not to be sending tags up with with shows obviously they could be added afterwards
but it would be great if we had a bit more contribution to the the tagging process for for older
shows. Yes we do get we do get some contributions I should say uh Windigo has sent some in recently
which is very kind of it but uh a bit more would be very much appreciated. You're pointing on me
up and you do. I think you do absolutely absolutely why why just just tell me why you're not angry
you're just disappointed. That's it that's it. Okay cool stuff um anything else that we need to talk
about and the upcoming stuff. Any other business? Well the any other business has been covered
but I thought I would check that in. I added a bit to my show note building script to do it. So
yes it is. It would be cool if people could in actual fact send you some announcements if they
wanted coming out on the HPR community news show. Absolutely. Be more than happy to uh you can
so tweet us at at HPR. We've got a three letter twitter handle because we're so long in the two
so yes uh tweet us your stuff and send in your show suggestions as well and topics. Oh yeah
I asked for a topic there on capacitors because I was thinking I'm getting my head round
what a capacitor is and what it does and then some throwaway comment Julian
let me about the voltage on both sides of the capacitor going positive at the same time
and he put the word of course in there and that made no sense to me whatsoever how if it doesn't
pass through current DC current then how how does that work? Somebody help help explain capacitors
to me thank you have a nice day bye yes yes it's physics isn't that but don't ask me yeah just
physics that I can understand the chemical engineering can understand that's all I'm asking
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's a it's a big subject because these things are getting bigger and
bigger and bigger these these sort of things you can run your car off yeah not far off yeah but I just
want to know those the I thought it stopped AC current are DC current and that AC current only goes
through uh in out of sign that it builds up on one side and then it's negative on the other side
and that it's just by virtue of the fact that you kind of got a vacuum you know think of it like a
a a bellows or a bladder in the center that fills up and then discharges and then fills up
and discharges and then the other side experiences the negative as you filling up a positive on one
side you're negative on the other I don't I thought I had it and then all of a sudden oh and I also
want to know how a capacitive dropper works in a power supply because that makes no sense it's a
resistor somebody please help me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah think Climb coach about them all the time
yeah I'm actually looking at a screenshot here of his notebook where he describes a
capacitor of dropper and it's a way of for people who don't know it's a way of getting a a DC
voltage from an AC mains power supply and it's something about the inbuilt resistance of a capacitor
but uh help me here yeah yeah there's there's a smoothing element as well isn't it yeah I know
that somebody who understands this has gone Ken you're just such a moron there's no way I could
explain this because you've got two different things but yeah yeah do a series then do a series
I'm I'm on the moron train too so yeah please somebody tell him past him
hahaha somebody somebody help okay good join us now and share the software you'll be free hacker you'll
