Today is going to be a short one, or I want to talk to you about a cool little utility called WPOT.
From the man page, WPOT is a free utility that is able to upload files to an FTP server.
Now, if I may be familiar with WPs as an application for downloading files from FTP servers or HGDP servers,
WPOT is kind of the equivalent of that application and it allows you to run our Manifals up onto a web server.
Some of the options if you go through the man page allows you to put it into the background, specify log files.
More or less for both, you can also specify the input files, the sort order, the base name, you can remove source files.
And one of the cool things it does is time stamping where if you're halfway through the process of uploading files, it'll skip over ones that are already there.
It supports rate limiting and one really cool thing is it supports proxies.
HG that is if you're company as HGDP based proxies such as squid or a sucks version file proxy, it'll allow you to specify a proxy mode and a proxy username and password.
Of course, it allows you to specify the port and whether the files are to be ASCII or binary.
It is one cool tool for use if you have to do any backups to an FTP server or if there's any occasion where you need to copy files out to FTP servers for other people to pick them up.
I found it to be a lot better as bypassing proxies than the equivalent NCFTP or something like that or a Perl script utility.
This one is just short sweetened to the point.
Okay, that's pretty much it. This is a HPR episode and hopefully you can do a five minute episode and send it into HGDP.
Thank you for listening to HGDP, HPR is sponsored by Carol.net, so head on over to CARO.NAT for all of us here.
