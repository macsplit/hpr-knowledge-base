Its weddings did the 13th of November 2019 and this is HPR episode 2943 entitled Music
as Life.
It's hosted by Brian, it's about 10 minutes long, carries an explicit flag and the summary
is Quantum Harmony.

Alright, this is going to be a test.
Next of this recording, whether it works well or not, but it might at minimum be a record
of some thoughts that I've been having.
I recently heard a physicist discussing a paper that he wrote or a note.
Anyway, I'm not sure if that's a literal or a scientific publishing term within the
field.
You write a note, it's a bit more informal about some thoughts that he'd been having about
the music as life and not in a metaphoric sense.
I didn't read the paper, I listened to him, he gave a decent, very basic, condensed which
is kind of conflicting, but whatever, abstracting of the concepts.
The concept he states began with his lifelong adult life study of Chi or Chi or life force
energy and that we've been using the term energy improperly, that it doesn't fit the
classical definitions of energy in, I guess what we would call classical physics.
He spends a bit of time discussing where classical physics has failed to incorporate Copenhagen
interpretation and quantum mechanics and chaos theory into our modern science and that
we're kind of stuck in the classical, the observer does not matter world.
If I recall Einstein once spoke of gravity as the object paying attention to the other
objects and I think that fits in to Mr. Anderson's description of rather than using the
term energy to describe Chi using more a term of harmony and he goes into good descriptions
of how we think of melody and progression of tones in relation to one another forming
what we call melody and harmony being those simultaneous tones played at the same time
creating what we call harmony and then rhythm being a progression of the beat in Sanskrit
we have the Om and in the writing of the Om at the top we have that little partial circle
with the dot in the middle that's the Navabindu that's the sound the tone and the pulse and
the rhythm in my mind would be the organization of the pulse so he goes into it a bit with the
bodily perception of music in relation to say some examples were that the fastest rhythm
that the body really produces that we perceive as rhythm would be a teeth chattering or a
shivering and simultaneously if we were listening to a rhythm if it got much faster than that
frequency then we would perceive it more of a tone conversely our breath or our walking we can
slow down to super slow rhythm but eventually we get to a point where we lose the perception
of breathing or walking and the breathing becomes a pausing between your inhale and exhale almost
perceptively or your walking becomes a standing still and shifting your weight from one foot to the
other again these are not necessarily absolutist they're just good examples but
what he does not continue to go into and that's my elaboration on his theory of music as life
and he doesn't mention the Einsteinian objects paying attention to one another
the idea that the observer affects the universe basically their universe their space time
which is not there is a loan of course but that it affects the space time
now thinking about the rhythmic examples of our perceived rhythms or the universal perceived rhythms
how does the universe perceive we perceive a rhythm until it gets to a point where our system now
perceives that rhythm as a tone that tone in my mind encompasses rhythm and frequency
harmony in the upper and lower the crests and troughs of the wave form and very consistent but
distinct melody that's almost formed perceptually when the tone is played consistently for a longer
duration it begins to sound different you start to hear rhythms and melodies within that tone
of course I'm telling you what you perceive at this point which is always wonderful for science
but that's how in my perception and of course the entire universe perceives the way that I perceive
so because I'm the universe of creating it in my own mind in my perception he's to say you're
even there dear listener so my system loses track of the rhythm and gets to a buzz which would
become a tone so as separate systems interact with one another they could theoretically be said to
have a tone or a pulse that ends up joining with the rest around them and that's where we can end
up with our harmonies and we can end up with discordant harmonies we know that from our music that's
with more of a metaphorical but after listening to his ideas and kind of rolling them around in my
head it seems like that is the way that the universe is working it is working as music and we perceive
what we call music as this entertainment medium but literally at the what we would call the
energetic scale where the we are wrong of course and I am more and more believing in this
that's the harmony that energetic exchange becomes the harmony within the universe that is why when
a living creature suddenly becomes a dying creature we don't actively see what we would call an
energy exchange what we see is the loss of harmony between those systems and those melodies interacting
within the body well that's something that I was kind of thinking about so I figured I'd make
a report on my way to work and now I'm there so good day
