Welcome to our show
Welcome to the Uber Lead Hacker First Radio
And episode number two
My name is Sig Fluff
And in this episode
We're going to be releasing
We're going to be releasing
An alpha version
Part of it's done
The interface to this is done
And I'm looking for
So this is a replacement
For a Dacity
With focus
With focus
Specifically on recording
Recording radio programs
And speed
And stability
So
I have the interface part done
And I want to
Fix any problems that this has
And optimize this
As much as I can
So
And you can reclone the Git repository
That this is in
And the Git address is Git's colon slash slash
R-E-P-O-D-O-R-D-S-L-H-R-R-D-G-I-T
That is repo.or.cz
And the Czech Republic
Slash-H-R-R-D-Git
The name of this is
Hacker Radio Rec
And we won't have an official
Release of this
Perversion 1.0
And
When that comes
It will be fully functional
More or less.
There's kind of a unique
Sort of functionality
That I'm aiming to put in version 2.0
But we want to have
The full functionality
Just replacement for Dacity
5 version 1.0
So this is version 0.5
So if you have anything to suggest
About the interface, if you have new
Problems, if it doesn't work for you for whatever reason
If you have any patches
Or any documentation
Or anything like that, you certainly
May contact us at
Pantsbutt at gmail.com
I am developing this
Alongside
The app
I am developing this
Alongside
SVNR13839
Version of FFMPEG
I know that
New versions of FFMPEG
They've moved around the
FIFO stuff
So this may not work for you
I'm not sure yet
But what you want to do
Is clone that repository
That will produce a directory called
HRR
Make install
And hopefully that will work
Will install a binary called HRR
Into your path
Or your prefix
And there also is a configuration file in there
That you can use or
You cannot use it doesn't matter
Called HRR.com
It looks for this file in
Slash ATC
And also your home directory
.hrr.com
So thank you
For checking out this semi-release
And we will be
Looking forward to releasing more
Things for you in the future
So take care, bye-bye
And happy hacking
