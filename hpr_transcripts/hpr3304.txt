News Flash 21104 from Hacker Public Radio.
An upgrade to some standard information formats.
Introduction after many years of confusion.
It has been decided to produce a common standard for dates and times
between Europe and the United States of America.
When encountering a USA date such as
03-1-4-2021, known as Pi Day in the USA,
there has been a peculiarity of which part of the date is the day
and which the month.
It can also be confusing as to the year if the 2-digit form is used.
Standardization is a way in which these sorts of ambiguities can be resolved.
Having a common method of representation of words confused you.
Therefore, starting in 2021, in the spirit of clarity and prevention
with understanding, the EU has decided to standardize
on compatible formats wherever possible.
Dates.
Henceforth, dates will be represented in one of two following forms.
Month.
Slash.
Day of Month.
Slash.
2-digit year.
Often represented as MM.
Slash.
DD.
Slash.
Y-Y.
Or.
2-digit year.
Day of Month.
And Month.
Represented as.
Y-Y.
Slash.
DD.
Slash.
MM.
Thus.
21.
Slash.
14.
Slash.
Over 3.
Or.
3.
Slash.
14.
Slash.
21.
We'll be universally recognized
as Pi Day.
Times.
The break from the previous tyranny
of large medium-small
or small medium-large formats
has been extended
to 24-hour-time representations.
Henceforth, 24-hour-time
will be represented in one of the following two forms.
Seconds colon hours colon minutes.
Often represented as SS colon HH,
colon MM.
Or.
Minutes colon hours colon seconds.
MM colon HH, colon SS.
Bash already introduced support for this last year.
You'll need to update to you.
You're going to follow this to get the latest version.
Future plans.
Standardization work in group
will be planning other measures.
Fourth coming rationalizations
will be weights and measures.
Descriptancy such as the US point
which is 16 fluid ounces
versus the British point
which is 20 fluid ounces
will be examined.
Temperature.
Farmer versus centigrade
is will be easily replaced
by the new year attempt
which struggled with both ranges.
The choice might be
the ranking scale
represented by
the green sign
and the letter A
the base has yet to be decided.
