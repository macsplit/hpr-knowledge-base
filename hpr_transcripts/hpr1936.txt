Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon, you're listening to Hacker Public Radio Community News.
For December 2015, for those of you new to Hacker Public Radio, we are a community
podcast that means the shows are contributed by listeners like your good self.
As it says on the website, your ideas, projects and opinions podcasted.
We have new episodes every Monday through Friday and we do this show, which is a look
at what's been going on on the HBR feed, which is a podcast feed.
Go quickly go through the shows, read some of the comments that have been left on the
website and we also go through some of the things that have been going through on the mailing
list.
Some months it's very quiet there.
This month has been pretty busy.
First things first, we'd like to welcome our new hosts and I do have a tradition of
buttering people's names, so please keep that in mind as we go through this thing.
First host was Clinton Roy, Archer 72, Delinix Experiment and Cove.
So welcome to you all and long way you continue to participate in the community shows.
So let's have a look first at last month's show starting with 1921, the open NMS interview
that Latu did at the All Things Open Conference.
He did quite a few interviews from there and this is a network monitoring package and for
those of you who are doing backend servers and the like, it will be a very interesting
one to go and have a look at.
The next day, Delinix Experiment gave us the Linux Experiment, basically a few people
decided to try Linux for a while out of their multiple distributions and stuff and they
are basically challenging any of Hacker Public Radio as well to go ahead and do this.
I think it's actually quite good because in order to experience a desktop, I've just switched
over to KDE 5 on my wife's desktop and I really don't like it, I really don't like it
and I'm sent to myself, is this me or is this the way things are going to go?
So you know, live it for a while and then maybe it'll grow on you after a while.
As it stands now, it is not as annoying as it was to begin with so therefore I'm assuming
a lot of it is me.
So let's continue on with that.
So yes, thank you for those guys coming in.
And then we had waking up the follow on episode to Windigo's waking up series.
So this had a comment from Windigo itself, one opt, nothing but your crappy Bash alarm
clock into perspective, like dynamic lighting and is authentic music because the Roomba
carry you a cup of coffee in the morning as well.
Yes, that is what I was thinking, Windigo's house is, or sorry, Jezra, who did the show.
House is very, very automated and I've often set up for more and I'll say again, that
is a house I would very much like to go and visit if I ever do make it to the US.
The following day, Ahuka, 1915, Libra office in press, so this is the presentation part
and how to put tables in there and often you chart, pictures and movies and stuff so you
can also, he looked at those earlier and now he went into putting tables in and probably
this is, you know, if you're doing a presentation, a small table like this is as good as anything
is kind of better and easier and less complicated than open up a spreadsheet, a dynamic spreadsheet
inside.
The day after we had the community news, which is done by HVR volunteers, at the moment
Dave is feeling a bit ill, so our best wishes go out to him and so I'm here flying my
own sub, which is not surprising, giving most of people have used all their chat up on
the New Year show.
The following slot was 1917 open source.com, an interview with Ricky Enzli from open source.com
and Tlatu has, I think also published on there and it is a red hat sponsored site I think
but I don't think they have editorial control but it is a fabulous, fabulous resource and
during this month you're going to see one of their articles, a series of their articles
been narrated for us on this here, HPR show.
There was one comment on the community news episode, which is Charles and LJ and he was
referencing, you got a lot of a site that lets you add content for free and then charges
you to reference it later and he was referring to experts exchange, which he thought was quite
funny, you could rearrange it as expert sex change.
So yes, quite funny there and the comment on episode 1917, which is open source.com interview
again at John Colp saying a possible outlet, thanks for a great interview and now thinking
about possible article topics for there.
I must say I was thinking the same thing myself but I have so much on my own plate right
now.
I don't think I need any more, thank you very much.
We had our old friend Zoke back again and I'm delighted to have this interview with Dave
Kennedy, one of the well-known people in the security world and basically at some training
he so managed to capture a few interviews with these guys, very, very impressive.
If you don't get a chance to go to DerbyCon, it's on my list of things I really like to
do and Dave Kennedy talks about how they do penetration testing and so must listen
interview.
Following day again, another interview from the same people, David Koblitz, apologies
for killing the name and this was another interview as well in relation to pen testing.
On the other side of the fence, we had the following day, 1920, let me just check to see
if there were any comments on these.
The DerbyCon interview with Zoke, with Dave Kennedy, there was a comment from Frank.
I used to play cues in CMUS, once that cue around 20 to 25 minutes was done, CUMS goes
back to a random, lively playback.
Here's the catch.
What if the random piece after the classical music is also a classical?
In such a case, you would not notice that it is time to get up, which is a problem I regularly
encounter.
I can't and really want to have two different collections to keep the two apart.
I think actually a comment is slightly misplaced.
It should have been attached to Jezre's episode about getting up, so not to worry.
We will have the comment in Ninjas, namely Dave, work on that one later.
Privacy and security, as we said, 1920, the 21st in this series on privacy and security,
SSH authentication keys by Huka, and about how to use public-private key pairs for authentication
instead of passwords.
This is an excellent way to stop a lot of the password database attacks against your website
because simply you don't have a password at all.
Definitely, using SSH on the public internet, this is something that you should do.
It also means if you use something like an SSH agent, you can keep the keys for all your
login ones, open up the keys with your SSH agent, and then you simply SSH to a site.
It takes care of the username and are they authentication for you, so I use that all the
time.
First thing in the morning, I run my agent, and then I'm good for the whole day.
How to run a conference, which was by Clinton Roy, and this was in absolutely excellent,
not only about all the things that go right, but all the things that go wrong, and it makes
me want to never, ever run a conference again.
Hands off to everybody who does put conferences together, amazing, amazing, amazing thing.
So thank you, Clinton, for coming on board and sharing that one with us.
The following day, we had Archer72 coming with the case to back up Google email and the
short enough show, but short suite and to the point is up there for one of the shorter
issues ever, so 52, 57 seconds.
However, Google takeout, Thunderbird email, and import export tools for Thunderbird basically
explains exactly what you need to be able to do.
You can also set up an IMAP to Google account, and while it's IMAP, it's not 100% IMAP,
or at least it doesn't seem to be 100% IMAP as your email is not always removed as you
would expect it to be.
Yeah, go ahead.
Hey, John Culp here.
Well, John, you're just going to save the day because I am here behind my own, so let me
turn on text to speech.
Turning on, actually, push the talk, actually, that's what I mean.
Right.
So do you want to start again, or shall we just start again?
We don't have to start again.
We could just jump in where you were.
I had almost forgotten about this, but then I thought I should probably check in just
in case Ken is all by himself.
Thank you very much, so kindly.
I'm already up to 1923, tattoo, and sister 76.
I can hear myself.
Are you on speakers?
Or do you have a headset?
Yes, I was on headphones.
Hold on.
I'll put those on.
How is that?
That's going to be better.
Sorry.
I was taking a drink of coffee there.
That's good.
I don't hear a neck out now.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I know.
I was thinking, well, if I'm by myself, I'll just get rid of the push to talk and put
on the speakers, because then I can hear people coming.
I would have done the same thing.
So system 76, if people don't know them, they're dedicated to producing computers with
Linux on them, basically, and seem like they have some very, very nice machines out
there.
I've often wanted to buy one of these, and then I'm always, you know, the great thing about
buying one would be that, you know, the guaranteed hardware compatibility with Linux, whereas
when you buy a Windows machine, and then wipe it out and put Linux, you run a little
bit of risk unless you've done a lot of research ahead of time, but somehow the price is, I mean,
the prices are not terrible or anything, but I can always find that I can get a Windows
machine for $100, $200 less.
Yeah, I get that, and I had the same thing myself, well, from suppliers over here,
but I met the conscious decision to pay the premium because sometimes you just have to
send a signal, I do not want a machine that Windows on it because every machine that
you buy what Windows on it is a, you know, it's, it's another notch on the underbed post,
basically.
Yeah, at the next time I buy a brand new, and I probably will go with something like the
system 76, although the last computer I bought was one I was inspired by NY Bill who bought
on eBay, a ThinkPad T201, I think it was for something like $90, and I put Linux on
it.
And so then I bought, I did the same thing, I found on eBay, I won an auction for $107,
got a ThinkPad T201, and it's pretty nice little machine, it's got a Core i5 processor,
4 gigs of RAM, and I figure buying a used machine that has known hardware compatibility,
I'm at least doing some, I don't know, environmentally sound thing to do, I know that what's
the space on the software freedom law, the sender, the show used always recommend buying
used computers, Bradley Cune, I think that was it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and he's, no, I agree, and those ThinkPads are nice machines, it has
to be said.
Yeah, I like it.
I don't think it's going to be my main machine, but it's a really nice laptop for that kind
of money for, I mean, just over $100, it's hard to beat.
Yeah, exactly.
Okay, 1924 port forwarding, and I like these because in 1900, Ouka suggested changing
the default SSH port, and I asked why not employ port forwarding, which is actually something
I was thinking about the time as well.
Yeah, I normally will, I don't think I had used port forwarding in quite the way that
he's talking about using here, I mean, what I did normally was change the default port
of my SSH server, and then just use port forwarding on my router to make sure that SSH queries
went to the right machine, and he's not talking about doing that precisely here, I don't
think.
He was talking about, I thought he was talking about that you open the port on your router,
and then if it comes in on 222, you forward it to 22 on an internal machine, which is
what I do.
Right, I think that's how he said to do it, and the way I've always done it was to change
it from the default 22 port to something else on the server itself.
Okay, and that's what Kevin was saying, Huca, in his show, so yeah, I'm more inclined to
do what 50 you were saying, because you have to go to the router anyway to set up your
port forwarding.
Yeah, it makes sense.
And Kevin replied saying it was a great show, I'm really happy that my friend 5150 has
continued the conversation on this topic, I just what I love to see in HPR, it's like
listening to the conversation we might have together at a conference.
And that is exactly when people do reply shows like this, it's absolutely awesome.
Yep, agreed.
And you can happily just agree with somebody, don't feel that you have to agree with everybody,
if somebody wants, if I say something wrong in a show, please do a show to correct me.
It won't take any offense at us, unless you call me any, everybody makes friends about
it.
So we should be post comments and do a follow up show or just do one of the other.
I would argue in my persona as a HPR record show, record a show for the do both, I say, or
when you comment, the person who did the show reply back on, you know, you should do a
show about that.
Yeah, I often put that in one of my comments.
And then your list of shows increases, and that falls under that, you've promised me
a show.
Right.
I mean, you know, as many shows as I've done this year, and it's probably been 30, 25 or
30 shows, I still have, I have a list of topics that I want to do that's still like a
dozen long.
Funny how that happens when you're in conversations with me, John, I was actually thinking about
that very thing, because I wasn't that I'll camp this year.
And I was looking at the stream of the August, you know, the Augusters presentation panel thing.
And all the show, all the hosts that were there, none of them had done more shows than Dave
Morris.
You know, if you counted the shows Dave did and the community knew shows, he was, he had
done double what most people had recorded, and you know, was at least 10 higher than all
any of the other people on the panel.
Well, that means some of those people need to record some shows, doesn't it?
It does.
I don't, yeah, I don't think, I don't think that's the, I don't think we're as boisterous
as we need to be on, on HBO controversial is the word I'm looking for.
Yeah, maybe not.
I don't know.
I found that once you kind of get yourself a good workflow for these things, I don't want
to say that anybody should be intimidated from doing a show in the very, for the very
first time or anything, but after you've done several of them, it just gets so much easier
that you just got to get over those first couple of ones.
And then, and I do, I mean, I recorded three shows in three days this past week.
And I just, you know, now that I had the time, I did it.
It's not that hard once you kind of get in the flow of it.
Yeah.
And if you, if you do that record a few shows, you know, you can post them out once every
month or, you know, every few weeks or back to back or whatever you want to do.
So don't necessarily need to be coming out all the same time.
I usually do every two weeks, although I've got one, I haven't posted the third one yet
because I'm waiting to see whether a desperate need arises.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good plan.
Show 1925, KD, KD in live, part one introduction to KD by Gettys, who had previously done
a narrated show on his own accord, based on an article that was in the awesome,
epic guide, KD, part one, and that was in Linux Voice magazine.
And he mentioned at the end of that that, you know, he'd be interested in doing some
more shows.
And of course, I got in contact with him because I had just read an excellent, excellent series
of articles from Seth Keneland, who's known to the community as well in other forms, who
had been on opensource.com and had done a series on KD in live.
And I think it's, it transfers well to audio.
If you can look at some of the pictures from opensource.com that might help, but I think
it transfers very well to audio.
It did.
I love this.
And I think this is one of the better video tools on Linux that I've found.
I've tried numerous ones, but this one is the one I keep coming back to if I have to
do any kind of video editing for its ease of use.
You know, it's not as powerful as something like, I've heard people using blender to do
some video editing.
But this one has not nearly so steep a learning curve and it just does what you need.
You know, I wait until the end of this series and then, and then see if you still hold
by that statement of it not being as powerful.
Yeah, maybe I, maybe I just don't know what its power really is.
And to be honest, I don't do a whole lot of video editing.
I do much more audio than video.
Yeah.
And Gettys has a absolutely, you know, one of these reading the telephone, telephone
book voices as, yeah, it's good.
It's good.
Poppy would say.
Yeah, I really like this.
I'm looking forward to the next one.
The national measurement institutes was HPR 1926, a short overview of the institutes and
what they do.
Now, right here, this is a show that I don't think anyone would think of submitting, but
it is absolutely a perfect show, cos it nails the topic right there.
Yeah, these are really interesting and cool.
I would never have thought of doing something like this, but it was great.
You know, one of those things when you wonder if this is, is this going to be of interest
to hackers?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I was just thinking about that, you know, the whole, the whole need to have weights and
measures is such a fundamental thing to governments and organizations of governments.
You know, this has been going back to, for years upon years where, where, you know, merchants
have been trying to rip off the people and the people go to the magistrates and the
magistrate goes to the king and the king chaps off people's things.
And, you know, the bakers doesn't be in 13, comes from the way it's a measure thing because
they were required to, you know, if they didn't supply 12 loaves, then if they short-change
to anyone in order to get over that, they give them an extra loaf.
So, yeah, very interesting.
So, that was a, a security measure to make sure that nobody ran a foul of the dozen thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
Because if they weighed all the loaves and they had shrunk or something, the weight was
supposed to be, whatever the weight was of 12 loaves.
So in order to get around that, they added another one in to make sure that they're working
well to lose their house or parts of their anatomy.
See, I need to have that explanation, like, printed up on a little business card-sized
thing.
Because, like, my wife always, when she goes to a target to get bagels, they've got really
good bagels at the target super stores here for whatever reason.
But when she explains to the cashier that she's getting a bakers dozen, because there's
a special price for bakers dozen, these poor young people have never heard of a bakers
dozen before, and she has to explain to them every single time, but no, this really
does mean 13.
It doesn't mean 12.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
Okay.
Yes, here's the QR code.
There you go.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Excellent.
The following day, Tatoo talks to Ansible at the All Things Open Conference.
He actually got to do quite a lot of shows, and that's a way, it's actually quite cool.
It's quite a cool way to do graphs and automation and stuff like that, manage your system,
crunch complexity.
Right.
I'm trying to refresh my memory as to what this one was about.
The notes for this episode are very sparse, and so I'm having trouble remembering exactly
what this one was about, but I've enjoyed every one of these things that Tatoo has done
at the conference.
Well, according to the website, is a radically simplified IT automation engine that automates
child provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, infrastructure service
orchestration, and many other IT needs.
Sounds like something we all need.
Yeah, this is a bit like a pop-up or chef or CF engine where you do, but it's all based
on SSH, so you know, copies, configurations over like, if you're into server configuration
management, it's definitely something that'll be on your radar.
Okay.
I do really low-level server management, but it's just the servers in my house and one
at the office, so I've never needed to keep an eye on dozens of servers at once or anything
like that.
So this whole thing, it's a new kind of tool to me.
Yeah.
Also, a new way of thinking I worked for a while in a place that was well organized like
this, and they use CF engine, and it's a completely different mindscape rather than connection
to the servers.
You never actually connect to the servers.
You do everything through the configuration management server comes on and it just appears
and then it's configured and you're finished with, and then it goes away.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, it's, it's, I mean, there's a lot of these, especially for, you know, your Amazon
type things where you bring up servers and, you know, they're dynamically provisioned,
and then when you don't need them, you just get rid of them because it costs your money
and you, you take it over basically on one server and then the load increases five seconds
later.
You have four more servers in the air.
And so it continues.
We should get some people to actually do some shows and that sort of stuff.
I would.
It would be fascinating.
I find it fascinating, but I also nod into it.
It's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, that whole, like, generating new servers on the fly thing is, is really interesting
to me.
I can't imagine a scenario where I would need to do it, but it's, it's really interesting
to hear people talk about it.
Yeah, absolutely.
The following day we had Colves Jams, which is 1928, and it's reviving a really old tradition
we have here on his pure and indeed before that on today with a techie, which was Creative
Commons licensing, playing Creative Commons licensed music.
And it was in the All Songs Considered series.
And I would like to take my hat off to Colves because the first time I saw this, oh, somebody
sent me in eight songs and I'm going, oh, right, now I'm going to have to make sure that
all the Creative Commons licenses are in order.
But every single one was absolutely, all of them are CC by SA.
No problems there.
So well done to him.
And also nice music.
Yeah, well, I may have to go back and listen to that one.
I'll be honest.
I didn't listen to this one because I'm not normally, I don't normally want to listen
to a music podcast.
Music is kind of something I do all day at work every day.
And so the only music podcast I ever listened to is the bug cast.
But I might go back and listen to it.
It should be noted that the series All Songs Considered is the same title as something
on National Public Radio over here in the United States.
You don't say.
Is that something you guys are aware of?
Yeah, considering that we were Hacker Public Radio is picked because it was NPR, HPR.
Okay, I got you.
Very good.
I believe at least.
Although it's not NPR anymore.
It's International Blah, something, something.
Well, NPR still exists.
I don't know if All Songs Considered is under their supervision anymore.
Science Friday has moved off of NPR or to International, something, something.
That would be a Public Radio International.
That's the one, yeah.
PRI Public Radio International.
Anyway, there were some comments on this.
Shadwey Figure chived in, going nice mix of.
Thanks for sharing.
I've found the lineup of different genres refreshing, looking forward to the next show.
And T-Cook, T-C-U-C, says nice.
I can't wait for more.
I've heard a few episodes.
The showcase and good C-C music.
And I like having an easy way to listen to curated C-C music.
Keep them coming.
Smiley face.
David L. Wentz, Wilson said.
Yes.
I ran to my desk at work to bring the Billy Corgs problem.
Thanks for an excellent jam, Cove.
So, if you did like that show, consider doing your own.
If you didn't like that show, consider doing your own.
Of favorites that you like.
Yeah.
See what they're doing.
I do.
If you didn't like it, then you got to show what really good music is like, huh?
Yes, indeed.
By the way, if anyone has found a flash, has lost a flashlight somewhere around La Pia,
Louisiana.
The next show might be of interest to you.
1929.
And I was thinking, God, this torch must be run over by cars as you were picking it up.
Unbelievable.
It's a truly amazing piece of gear.
I had never seen anything like it.
And, yeah, I mean, you have to hold it in your hands and shine it in the pure dark to really understand how great this is.
So, I thought I had to record an episode about it.
I must say, I do have a little bit of a flash light once a fetish.
It's not a fetish, but I do have quite a lot of torches around.
It has to be said.
And I was thinking, I really want one of these.
It's well worth the money.
I mean, it does cost a lot, but the quality is astounding.
So, even if you spend over here on Amazon, it's $125.
I don't think you would feel like you got ripped off.
I mean, it's still a lot of money to pay for a flashlight.
It is.
But again, if your job requires you to have a flashlight, then I would like one that isn't going to crop out of me after five minutes.
Yeah.
The main thing would be not to lose it.
Absolutely.
Or have your name engraved on the thing.
Well, they do come with serial numbers.
So, you can keep track.
I mean, I think the police department keeps track of their inventory that way.
Each officer is assigned a flashlight with a specific serial number.
And that's how they control the inventory.
But, you know, the police department here, when I contacted them, they said,
no, we're not missing any.
So, I got to keep it.
All I had to do was buy a charger for $28.
And, man, I didn't even hesitate.
Because, I mean, even before I found this thing, even spending $28,
would have seemed like too much for a flashlight to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And there was a comment on this from a shadowy figure.
Thank you for this timely episode.
Hey, Dr. Colman.
I just wanted to take a minute out to say this is the sort of X episodes I tune in for.
I see what you did.
Yeah, there you go.
But, um, the secondly, they're entertaining.
But, as for the flashlight, could you take it?
It's all a resistant desk for it.
Oh, boy, that's fun.
I get that now that I just...
Yeah, exactly.
What was he all about?
All right.
Yeah, I didn't get that coming until later on.
Yeah, in the next month at the center.
It's in this month.
It's in this show.
Oh, it is.
Yeah, yeah.
I just listened to it this morning or yesterday, though.
So I'm only now getting this joke.
I saw the comment when it came in, but I didn't get the chainsaw resistant desk joke there.
Excellent.
The following day, actually, I just wanted to say on that that, you know, in the...
I know from being a mechanical engineer that things are deliberately designed to break after a period of time.
So you make it for...
It must last so long, but no longer than that.
So it's like the sweet spot, but it is nice.
It always guiled me as an engineer that you would do that.
You know, you should build stuff to last if you're going to the trouble.
And I think we, as consumers, should ensure that if we are doing stuff, we buy stuff that is going to last where possible.
Where possible, yeah, but, man, it does...
How do you know?
How do you know beforehand?
You know, that's the thing.
It's hard to know.
Yeah, exactly.
One way to know is that these...
This is the kind of flashlight that all the law enforcement users that search and rescue team you.
I mean, because they know they can count on it.
That's the thing.
And our washing machine is on a separate note.
It is going, you know, just after the warrant, he's up.
You know, and exactly as often as it said, it would...
I mean, you know, there's one that we want to get.
But it's actually three times the price of it.
So you have to work out, is it going to be worth it for the number of washes that you get?
The other side of that would be to...
If you can't get the kind that will last forever, at least get the kind that's not too hard to work on yourself and install a new belt in your dryer or whatever.
I'm actually considering it's only a small leak.
So there's got to be a pipe or something.
So if somebody's got a...
How to repair a washing machine show in the pipeline?
Fire it over to you.
I haven't done that, but I have done a few repairs on our clothes dryer.
Put a new roller wheels and a new belt and a new blower wheel and stuff like that.
I didn't record a show about it though. Maybe I should have.
Yep.
Do.
And if you've also got some kits that you purchased, like John here.
Well, not everybody's lucky as John.
But if you have some kit that you purchased, that was a bit...
I don't know, I should have spent so much on that.
And it worked out or it didn't work out.
I'd love to hear about it as well.
You know, rock solid recommendations that would be...
That would be stuff we would like to hear about.
Stuff that would be great of interest taggers.
Okay, let's move on.
System D primer, episode 1930 by Clinton Roy.
And what I think this was a presentation that he had done as well.
And also a nice little overview of System D for us.
I think who has already did an episode on System D.
Let me just look that up now.
I can't recall that immediately.
I like this episode.
I've already been using System... I think most of us have probably had our systems switched over to System D.
And some of us may be kicking and screaming because we're so used to the init system.
Yeah, exactly.
But, you know, it's... I don't really... I think it works pretty well as far as I can tell.
Yeah, it was Steve Smettersd.
I think, episode 1672, System D for learners.
Okay.
And we just need one more System D episode and it'll be a series.
A series.
Somebody write the... Do you want about how to make a System D startup script maybe?
Yeah, that's... Yeah, exactly.
And I understand this. I've worked on Solaris and AIX as well.
And they have similar things.
But I think it... I don't particularly like the way it's going.
On the other hand, it is really nice the way they bring up NFS shares and stuff that...
If you do that via System D, you can use NFS shares quite nicely in the laptop, so...
Beginning to like it, I'm afraid.
Well, I don't... I think it seems like on my system I can still use the old init start and stop methods and they work.
So I don't know if they're both things still running side by side or if they're just...
Is some kind of a shoestring workaround where if you run one of those old init restart commands or something,
It just knows what to do.
I think when you run on the Fedora at least, it goes reassigning to, you know, gives you a one-liner saying,
Yeah, you've asked for it in it, but I'm actually running through System Control.
Okay, I'm using Debian and it might do something similar. I should probably mind out.
Anyway, Frank commented, hopefully it'll be on the right show this time.
Nicely done. I do appreciate the big picture overview.
It provides a context and frame for reference that many stories I've read about System D do not.
And I think that's actually one of the things that annoys me about when you make a big switch like this is
The time is spent on putting in the code, but the time is not spent putting in the...
Getting the word out there about how it's going to work and stuff.
Yeah, and then what happens is you end up going by hearsay.
You just keep hearing things from people who have said, oh, it hosed my system.
It did this. I hate it. And then you just get a lot of beer uncertainty and doubt running around.
Whereas, I don't know, it seems like this has been...
I remember when System D was first deployed on Arch Linux.
I was running Arch at the time and it hosed my laptop for a while on that.
I mean, and that kind of thing, I guess if you're running Arch, you kind of take that with a certain
difference, you know, you don't worry too much about it.
But on Debian, if that happens, it's very upsetting.
Yeah, I've had the last release of Debian where System D was introduced.
And it wasn't System D that caused the issue.
It was incredibly, incredibly flaky. I had a...
I had to completely rebuild the server and work that had been running for years.
I was extremely unhappy about the...
I bet.
Poor quality of the Debian upgrade.
Yeah.
The following day was another show by...
Can you do that for me?
I could try.
Amunizip? Amuniz... Amunisp?
I don't know.
Amuniz... I don't know what that is.
Well, the show was extremely interesting to agers.
I think it's like a micro-scoppy.
Nanoscale tools and atomic force microscopes.
Basically, an overview of, you know, everything when you get down to the nano or micro level.
This whole thing, I find it's super fascinating when you get down to that level of...
Zoom down to that scale. It's amazing.
And this was an absolutely fantastic overview of the tools and how they work.
I agree.
Totally awesome way over my head.
I didn't understand it, but it's fascinating.
Just thinking about how people can work on anything so small makes my head spin.
And so it's great to hear somebody who actually knows how to do it.
I remember we needed to, when I was working as a...
Not as a mechanical engineer, but in a place where there was mechanical engineers.
Mechanical engineering was ongoing.
There were some things that they needed to, you know, really zoom down on.
And they had to send off some things to try and guess.
To check wells to see if one of their wells was...
What type of fracture was occurring within the weld?
Within the weld?
Basically, they were doing a root cause analysis.
So they sent it off to be, you know, investigated with these nano type,
or really small views.
And I thought at the time that was so cool.
We got the...
This cool.
Which is back. It's awesome.
Very, very cool.
Probably wasn't even down to a level like this, but still awesome.
Anyway, there were two comments to this.
Do you want to do the first?
Sure.
Comment number one by Mysterio 2.
Great show.
Interesting and informative.
Keep them coming.
And of course, we all agree with the keep them coming part.
Absolutely.
And the shaggy do we figure was going around leaving messages everywhere.
Good job.
Good job keeping us interested with a nice flow of interesting information.
Looking forward to more.
Couldn't agree more.
Okay.
Tlatu interviews.
Graf Fana.
Was this Graf Fana?
A powerful and elegant way to explore and share dashboards and data within your team.
This is used by loads of projects and is like a graphical engine.
And the graphs are absolutely gorgeous.
Cool.
I've never seen it before or even heard of it,
because this is just not the area that I work in.
But it was really interesting.
Just go have a look at some of the graphs that they have on there.
We use it in work for various different things,
which I'm not allowed to say because blah, blah, blah.
But we use it in work quite a lot.
Our tools that use these graphs in work,
and you can bring in salespeople in,
and they get it.
It's like the graphs are of the quality that you see in CSI.
That's amazing.
I'm looking at some now.
It really is beautiful.
It's great.
And the Shagudui figure says,
good interview, Tlatu.
Hi, Tlatu, good job of asking questions
and getting to the point and following up,
looking forward to more, as always,
you've got good radio skills.
Yes, he does.
And the HBR Audio Book 11 Street Candles.
And do you know what annoyed me about this one the most?
No, what?
It took so bloody long to get here.
Oh, this was a...
Have you read this book, Street Candles?
I just started.
You know, I started listening to this episode,
and they were raving about it so much that I stopped listening
to the episode and started listening to the book.
Very good.
That's exactly what you should do.
And I'm not going to spoil that anymore.
Right.
If you...
I...
I've not finished the book yet.
I'm about 15 or 16 chapters in.
And I actually went and bought the e-book,
as well, from the Kobo store.
And David wonderfully.
He's one of the authors who provides the e-pub without DRM.
So we all appreciate this.
And so I don't mind paying the $5.99 for a non-DRM file.
And of course, the first thing I did was to hack it,
to make it look the way I wanted to.
Of course.
But yeah, I'm enjoying it.
You know, sci-fi and space opera,
it's not really my deal most of the time,
although I've read all of the Nathan Lowell books.
And I like them.
But I mainly got this one because
I lost him Bronx as a guy that I go way back
with all the way to my first experiences
on the Linux Outlaws user forms,
where I first met in White Bill and Jezera
and all those folks.
So I just wanted to support his work.
But it's a really good book, too.
He is a very, very talented guy.
I mean, the reason I'm here behind this microphone
was because of an episode he did on HPR
about pug fading and, you know,
the correct way to approach it.
And so at the time I applied his knowledge
to suggesting that we reinvigorated HPR
and, yep.
So here we are.
Boss, I saw it.
I'm sorry, go ahead.
No, go on to one.
I was just saying that it looks like
there's a follow-up episode to this coming up
where they interviewed David.
Yes, David.
So I'm really looking forward to that.
And his stuff goes from comedy right up to dark.
And they mentioned it in this book as well.
But there's the one he did,
another one, Blue Heaven,
which was very,
very thought-provoking.
It's still fast.
That was one of the best pieces of literature I've read.
And I'm not talking about space,
whatever I definitely would classify them
among their pieces of classic works.
Cool.
Yeah, I really appreciate the guys doing this episode
because the term, you know,
I was aware that David did these kinds of things,
but, you know, when you get busy doing whatever you do every day,
you kind of forget to check and see if there's anything new out.
And so I was glad that they did this.
So I go and check it out.
And the audiobook club apparently is going strong still,
which is excellent.
And I need to find out what the next week are the next month's book is
because I haven't downloaded it yet.
I saw what it was, but I've forgotten now.
It seems like it's something that we all have heard of before.
But I'm just, never mind.
The call of...
The call of Blue.
That'd be the one.
HP Lovecraft.
Oh, yeah, it's a Lovecraft, right?
Lovecraft is classic stuff from the, what,
30s and 40s, 50s.
I don't know.
It's from quite a while back.
Fair enough I'm downloading it as we speak.
All right.
The following day was part two of the saga of Migo T0
to buy a shadowy figure.
And I told him off a little,
or I asked him about comments about,
basically feedback.
And this is marked as...
Okay, let's do what to show.
It is an excellent series.
I love it.
I don't know why.
I don't know if I love it because of the genre,
which I always loved anyway,
or whether it's because of all the in jokes in there.
So I'm wondering if somebody,
not from HPR,
is listening to the,
not familiar with all the people he's talking about,
would get as much out of it as we do.
I doubt it,
but they might enjoy it anyway, I think.
For us, it's hilarious.
I mean,
it cracked me up to hear
and make references to episodes that I've done
about the Lafayette Public Library's Makerspace
in my $2 microphone.
Absolutely.
The $2 microphone made an appearance,
and so I really loved it.
My dog, Morris Collins.
I just think this is so absolutely not Dave Morris.
Thank you, Morris.
Quite an assuming Dave.
Yeah, exactly.
He just cracked me up.
Yeah, that's great.
Some comments to that was
from a shadowy figure he upload updates
to the show notes at the comments,
which I need to, you know, clear out.
And I need to also come up with a better way
of having hosts update the comments
after they posted the show.
Yeah.
But anyway, we have a list
and very little time.
Anyway, Frank says,
Lost you there.
Okay.
It was a rainy day.
Loomy, sad and empty.
There was rain and not much else.
I had some urns to run.
Loomy or not.
Urns must be run.
If I'm myself driving down the street
with my little pickup,
recycling, waiting to be recycled in the bed.
Listening to some fellow
who calls himself a shadowy figure.
He was saying stuff.
I wanted a drink.
But I'd left the Scotch at home,
and any Scotch is better
than anything else.
But if you got no Scotch,
you have to make do.
I was beginning to wonder
into myself a shadowy figure
followed taking his slick
one step too far.
And then he said something.
And I found myself laughing out loud
all by myself in my little pickup truck.
Nice.
Yeah, the comment probably
and your method of delivery
won't make a whole lot of sense
unless you've heard this episode
on the last one.
But it was really funny.
And then I left the comment
just saying that I loved it
and how he made reference
to my Lafayette Public Library
thing in a $2 microphone.
And by the way,
the $2 microphone is my
Mike of choice nowadays.
Yeah.
I use it for almost everything.
I need to go and get myself
another.
If I were you, I'd buy five.
Yeah.
I think that's what Dave
of the love bug Dave from
I think he bought a pack
of five of them.
And he's been using them.
There was some reason he needed
one at the church where he goes.
I think they needed
a replacement for their microphone
there.
And he said this was better
than the ones that they were
paying $40 for.
Wow.
I use it with my phone
and with my Zoom.
And man, it's great.
It sounds, it's not professional
quite.
But man, it sounds pretty good.
And especially for two bucks.
Just sending myself a note about that.
Yeah.
I've got a link to the
device on my episode about
the $2 microphone.
Yeah.
I guess you did.
Okay.
So where are we now?
That was all the shows.
I really hope
which had we figured
does some more shows.
Now I've got a question for
everybody.
Is that show?
What's the word?
Explain.
Explicit.
And the reason I ask
is this.
I don't really
give a rat's ass myself
because I can only
understand why it's needed
in the ham radio thingy.
But on the iTunes show,
we're marked.
The whole HPR feed is marked
as explicit.
But the shows themselves
can be marked as clean
or not explicit.
And I know that
if you go to the HPR
get shows, the RSS feed.
That you will.
There's the options
in their advanced settings.
You can filter out
based on whether your feed is.
Explicit or not.
And we did that
because people are using
the HPR shows.
Are downloading that
and playing the stuff
over PA systems.
So.
Really?
Okay.
So.
The other thing is
if we were,
as most of our shows
are quite frankly technical
nature, 95% of them
never have any
call-trude words or not in them.
It's all because of
Jezra.
Well, perhaps.
So the thing is
if we removed the
explicit on the
Hacker Public Radio main
feed, that will give us
more publicity,
not that I
particularly worried about that.
But then we would need
to rely on the
explicit tag being
correctly assigned
on each of the individual's
shows.
So.
Right.
To finish off my point,
the only reason.
I will not be making that
decision, folks,
because I have my own
moral sets of views
and I believe that
children should know
how to curse properly
within the confines
of their home home.
And they should know
how to do this.
Not to do this in public
and you'll give people
the correct respect
that they deserve
or whatever.
So it doesn't matter
to me.
But I can definitely
see that it would matter
to other people.
And if we incorrectly
assign a show and then
it's reported to iTunes,
iTunes,
iTunes,
simply throw people
off the iTunes
feed.
And we do get a percentage
of people coming in
through iTunes still.
Yeah.
But I don't
remember hearing anything
in that episode
that was explicit.
Was there?
Yeah, but you see,
it's not.
That's the thing.
The explicit thing
as far as the US,
you're coming from the US.
You know what explicit
is because you listen to
the shows and you're
used to it.
To me,
here,
you're not allowed
to have,
you know, blatant
smoking,
blatant drinking,
you know,
referring to,
I don't know.
I see.
Of course.
And this tattoo was
commenting on because
a tattoo had uploaded a
image, you know,
a avatar
from a horror film
that I would have
considered to be an
explicit image,
as opposed to, you know,
people say in the
effort or whatever.
So,
explicit has to be,
if we're using
explicit,
and this is a global
thing, then,
as I put it on the
website,
if you're putting
explicit stuff in,
then you need to make
sure that it's not
being explicit for
anybody anywhere
in the world, basically.
I don't look
off.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
Now, think about that
for a while, you know.
Yeah, I don't have time to
track down that kind of
information.
And you can't even get it
for the US.
You cannot get a list
of the words that are
considered explicit.
The TV studios
do not have them.
They have their own
word of a list of about
60 words that you're
not allowed to say.
And then, if you
deviate from that, you know,
they get fined, and then
they, okay, okay, we know
that's a word that we're
not allowed to say.
And the fines are
significant.
I thought it was the FCC
that would have that
information.
They don't, they do not
publish what it is because
they.
That's a moving target.
Yeah, it's a moving
target, exactly.
And what I find funny
here is that some of
the words that are
extremely rude in
Ireland are used in
every day conversation
here as, you know,
just a naughty word.
Oh, I'm so
good.
So, yeah, that's, yeah,
it's an absolute
minefield.
I don't want to go down
into it.
So I, I'm happy with
any host picking whatever
whatever they feel is
correct.
But I just want everybody
to know if I asked that
question, the reason I'm
asking that question and
that I don't particularly
care.
But if it comes to it and
say, for example, John,
you put up a show and
you market as clean and
it's explicit for some
reason, which I doubt
but that I want to make
sure that you.
You, okay, I consider
this show clear what I've
said to be clean and safe
for appropriate audiences.
Then I want to know that
I can stand behind you
and that later on,
we got thrown out
because I accidentally
mislabeled your feed
when you actually intended
it to be explicit.
You see my point?
I do see it.
And I do, I have contacted
more and more.
Quite a lot of people in the
past about this particular
one.
And I just want to make it
clear.
I'm not.
You know, you need to.
I need to ask the question.
I don't particularly want to
ask the question.
And which is just for me,
it's easier if all the
shows are marked
explicit.
Then I don't have to worry
about it.
But then.
Then nobody has anything
to listen to on the other
shows.
But I would say,
just as a HPR guy,
you should always listen
to all the shows before you
have them publicly listened
to by miners or somebody
who would be offended.
Yeah, I call that proof
listening.
And I do at least two times
for everyone that I,
everyone I upload,
I listen to at least two
or three times.
I don't.
I just market explicit
and be told.
Well, I'm, to be fair,
I'm not always listening
for that.
I'm listening for just
whether it's working or not
or whether I just make
sure one last time that I
really did put the intro
and outro and all of that
stuff.
Yeah.
Okay.
Shall we do the
community or the
maybe list?
I've got a link here
on the HPR website.
Paste and send.
And that's,
that's got the archive
for December.
Okay, going now.
So we had a Hongkuma
Goo and 51 or,
yeah, Hongkuma Goo
and 5150 basically decided
to be in the lead
for the HPR show.
So rather than reading
all the news,
I'll just kind of
summarize it.
They recorded the HPR show.
I put on a recording here
as well for early.
They had said it was just
going to be limited to
six p.m. in the U.S.
at six p.m. UTC,
basically the U.S.
time period.
And,
but I said the recording
up anyway,
and just recorded
ones and zeros.
Basically zeros.
So we have to thank
John Newsteader,
obviously,
for hosting the
mumble server.
And this is the mumble
server that we're actually
using now.
He, I don't know if you're
familiar with it,
but he's put
a, he's got a whole
server there for various
different shows
that are open
service musicians,
podcasts, for example,
and the Python
experiment,
unseen studio,
pod nuts,
got lots of rooms
there for recording
shows.
And he very kindly
does it for us.
Yeah, that's very
nice.
Thank you, John.
And we don't thank him
enough for that.
Kevin Wisher also
provided a stream of
the mumble server.
And he has,
that's it.
He just set that up
by himself and went
ahead with it.
It was absolutely
awesome.
Taishisara.
Can you please
pronounce that?
Yes.
Can you please
pronounce that?
Taish, I
think.
Provide it.
I don't see the name.
I'll answer these
were on the website.
So I,
just there.
What's it?
Am I looking
in the wrong place?
I pisses it into the
chat.
Okay, hang on one
sec.
See Josh,
map,
hooking the
goo.
Where did he put it?
Oh,
Tajisara.
That's
one.
Tajisara.
Why can't I say that?
Yeah, that was
cool.
Berk and
Yerkey.
Sounds good to me.
Provided the
funds to extend the
bandwidth of the
mumble server for the
period of time that
we were doing.
Normally, it's quite
low.
Dave Lee of the
podcast offered the use
of his mumble server
and associated
inverse structure.
And of course,
we need to thank
Josh Knapp,
who is
from an honest
host.
And a host
here on HPR,
for providing the
HPR infrastructure.
Awesome.
And of course,
Hank and we go on 50
and 50 for
putting it together.
And thankfully,
editing the show is
something that I
never
slice and dice a
guys is my
vice slice and dice it.
Well, I'm
pretty sure that they were
going to use the
truncate
silence thing
liberally on this
because they were
long periods of silence.
They were indeed.
So other than that,
we had a question
about the show notes,
which was the
JavaScript
what you see
is what you get
thing.
Oh, no.
Well,
not again.
Show them.
You know what we're
what Dave and I have decided
to do is we are going to
now have a
drop down list on the
website,
which will have
it will just default
to you know,
plain old text.
When you have
plain text
reformeting,
which will be just
the whole thing
that will be wrapped
in pre tags.
And then you can
select your markdown
and you can select HTML.
And whatever you select,
that's what it's
going to be processed
as.
That work.
There's something
similar to that
on the learning
management system we
use at the university
on Moodle.
Well,
in your profile,
you can select whether
to have a wizzy way
getter or use a
plain text window.
And I use the plain text,
but underneath the window,
there's a drop down
menu with four options.
There's one where
it's plain text.
And there is HTML.
There's markdown.
And then the fourth is
Moodle Auto Format,
which I guess
just tries to figure
out what you're doing
and apply appropriate
formatting.
But it works really,
really well.
Yeah, we're just going
to think
Dave and I are both
spending too much time
on fixing show notes
for people.
So it will be better
to just make that
option available.
And then allow people
the option to go back
and edit themselves.
Love it.
There was an FTP
password change
because I'm an
idiot basically.
And I
didn't know.
No, no.
Wow.
I did.
I was in the conversation
and I thought I was having
a private, you know,
admin conversation.
And I leaked far too much
information out.
And most people should be
aware of.
Yeah.
Just be careful about it,
I guess.
What an opportunity
to update the password.
Hmm.
Hmm.
I put myself in the corner
for a while.
Let me just say that.
Uh,
Josh,
Josh upgraded the Git lab
as well.
He continues to plot away
improving stuff on the
backend.
And, uh, you know,
when we say we're there,
it means that's not really
true.
More like volunteers.
Um,
or facilitators might be
a better word.
And, um,
Sue, uh,
Josh is happily working
there on that.
Excellent.
Uh, Lord,
the scale for
X is going ahead.
I forwarded that on
and Lord D is
going and hopefully we'll
be able to get some
interviews out of it.
I'm sorry.
I must be looking at it.
Are you seeing all of these
messages in sequence
somewhere?
Yep.
Because I'm seeing a
I'm jumping.
I'm jumping over
all the HPR community
off topic once.
You should see
December 2015 archive
by thread.
Do you have that?
Uh, yeah.
But it looked like you were
going to
you jump backwards
from the password
changed to
Lord Dragon Blue.
Uh,
yes.
Go with it.
Go with it, John.
Okay.
I'm just trying to make
sure I'm looking at the
same thing you were.
Then, um,
yeah, I'm going to skip
over the New Year's
Show ones.
They're not really
relevant at the moment.
Oh, wait.
No. I'm sorry.
Lord Dragon Blue had
something after all those
community news.
I see it now.
Got it.
Okay.
So let's skip over the
New Year's Show ones as
well.
Um, they,
Josh,
we had to,
or we, he had to do
short version,
the people running the
knock art and being
too helpful,
uh, to issues that they've
been having.
After one such issue this
morning,
that's got them out of bed
at two thirty.
Um, the poor
drivers.
Yeah.
Uh, he's moving up the
time frame.
So he moved those
servers.
The only thing that we saw
as a result of that was,
uh, issue with the FTP,
um,
which has now been
resolved.
Subject of a next thread.
Yes, exactly.
Another thread.
Then we, uh, I asked,
uh, how to check if the
intro and outro are added
because if the intro and
outro are added, uh,
if we can determine that,
then that's one of the
questions that we need to
ask on the website,
which is, uh,
which is better.
Um,
the only thing sometimes I
need to contact,
uh,
hosts when I see that the
intro isn't added.
And I process it that way,
and then I listen to it,
and, uh,
then we have two HPR
intros on us,
or I,
they say that it is added,
and then I process it
that way,
and then there's no intro,
then I have to go back and
delete all the files,
uh,
and clean everything up.
So, um,
I would really be nice
to have a way to,
at least,
yes, I can confirm
that the HPR intros
there are,
confirm that the HPR
outro is there.
That would be nice to have.
You know, I might talk to,
um,
my, we've got a professor
on faculty who deals with,
um,
uh, the,
our media students,
and he might know
a solution to this,
kind of thing.
I don't know if he would know
one that's
scriptable,
but he might be able to point
me to something,
and he's really, really good
with, um,
audio analysis,
and stuff like that.
Cool.
If you,
uh, because
Carl D. Hamman,
I think,
Hamman,
uh, replied with
echoprint.me,
which looks
very, very interesting
to do fingerprinting
of particular music
for,
uh, D duplification
of your record collection,
or identification of songs
in your record collection.
So we would be kind
of doing that backways,
we would register that song,
and then see,
and see if we could find
us within that.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I followed that thread,
but it sounded like,
both,
like everyone in the thread
said it sounded really
promising,
but that they were
out of their depth.
Yes.
Yes.
So if you could bring
that to your friend,
and, uh,
we would,
uh, and just send us
the code.
That would be absolutely
awesome.
Yeah.
Well, I'll talk to him
about it.
Then a bunch of new
your shows,
updates.
Yeah.
I'm just going to skip
over all of those as well.
And, uh,
yeah.
I met a change today,
um,
to the upload thing,
uh,
because I,
I'm kind of paranoid.
I must say,
when it comes to accepting
random stuff
from random strangers
on the internet,
especially when
your site is called
Hacker Public Radio.
So, um,
up until now,
I've been just checking,
um,
you know, you,
you click,
you put in your email,
it sends you a link,
you click on the link,
and then you go to the
webpage.
So, um,
if you
don't click on the link
after a while,
after a few minutes,
they, um,
it's basically
that entry is removed.
However,
if you do click on the link,
and you don't process
the show,
then it remains
in that state forever,
because I worked
okay,
it's a random link,
okay, that's fine.
Problem with that though is,
if we don't have
a lot of shows in the queue,
and we need to say,
you know,
tomorrow's show needs
to be filled,
and somebody goes
and locks that show,
then we have a problem.
So, um,
what I'm doing now
is I'm going to,
uh,
I'm going to make sure
that that is,
um,
that is blocked.
So,
if somebody,
you know,
we'll free that up,
uh,
after four hours,
instead of indefinitely.
So,
uh, at the minute,
I'm not doing it,
I'll do it manually,
but, uh,
I do keep an eye on that,
but,
I'm working on the
cronjobscript
to do that,
to clean it up.
And we may also,
if it becomes a thing
where people are being naughty,
we might need to,
either ban,
those email addresses
or IP addresses,
but we'll see how it goes.
Um,
as far as
HPR community stuff goes,
and how the show,
you know,
the direction we should take,
that's always done on the mailing list,
but as far as security issues are concerned,
uh, we have a very clear line
that we will do,
whatever it takes to protect the,
uh, the servers,
and infrastructure.
Very good.
So, that's why sometimes,
uh, you,
people are not consulted
on security decisions.
Makes perfect sense.
And then we had a,
um,
big long thread
about the FTP server issues,
so I don't know if you want to go
into the results of that.
Well,
the result is that it's fixed.
Um,
I mean, the,
the issue is that there was some,
um,
mode or protocol
that no longer worked
after the site changed,
and like for that,
such that, uh,
I was not able to upload shows
using FileZilla,
which is what I normally
had used as my FTP line,
but it did work
when I just used
straight-old command line FTP,
and so I,
I used that,
but it sounds like,
um,
Josh, I guess,
has,
has solved the issue,
and everything is working normally
again.
And I think it was a case
where, uh,
Josh,
uh, knew exactly what was wrong,
and, uh,
was not in a physical location,
uh,
to be able to resolve us
given the time of year,
and family,
and all the rest,
so.
Yeah. Well, there was an
easy enough work around,
and he fixed it,
so it's all,
it's all good.
It's all good.
And the,
during that entire thing,
the upload via HTTP,
is it not to nudge-nudge-win-quick?
Yeah, only the problem
is that, uh,
I would have done that,
if I had still had access
to that page.
OK, the widget,
the nudge-nudge-win-quick,
in fact, myself, yes.
Yeah, I mean,
because I actually tried that,
I tried going back to my email
and clicking that link,
but then once you have
clicked submit,
you no longer
have access to that.
Yeah, you're done, yeah.
I'm going to,
I'm going to,
instead of investing time
in all day,
withy-week stuff,
I'm just going to,
going to do focus on that so that when the show gets posted,
people can look at their show and go,
oh, that's crap, I'll go back and I'll edit it again.
Yeah, that's probably time well spent there.
Yeah, and I also want to,
I've been thinking about the,
in your profile, when you upload a show,
you can fill in your email key.
So your GPG key or PGG key.
Your, your public key basically, yes.
And what I was thinking about there was
to make sure that people are able to edit their own shows
and post their own shows without any,
you know, you can self approve your own shows basically.
Right?
Because right now we will not accept any shows
without it being verified by,
you know, volunteers basically,
which will be the admin list
and whoever happens to be on that.
And that kind of makes sense
as you need to check for, you know,
cross-eyed vulnerabilities, blah, blah, blah,
attacks on the website and stuff.
However, there are certain people who have posted enough shows
and we know who they are.
So if you have a signed key,
then you will be getting a signed something or other
from wherever and then those people
who are quote unquote trusted,
would be able to basically post their own shows without,
and go back and edit their shows
without having to go through the authorization thing.
That sounds like a good plan going forward
to take some of the load off you guys.
Yeah, no, it's not.
It's more that this is a peer community.
So by definition, we shouldn't be involved at all.
So we should just automate it
and have the peers review it themselves
because I got an email from somebody during the week
which I asked, brought up very, very,
well, it was last week or the week before
about brought up some very interesting questions
about, you know, the stance HPR takes
and should we, that we should be curating the audio
that's been sent in and that there's a need for that.
And I said, yeah, fair enough there is,
but that's not what HPR is about.
HPR is about, you know, posting shows
and he or she met the comments that,
yeah, well, you could get somebody submitting
three hours of farts.
And if that's of interest hackers, that's allowed.
And I go, yep, actually that would be posted
in our current way, but you know,
we've managed to run for 10 years without that happening.
And any of the shows that are out of the ordinary
have been the ones that have caused the most interest to people.
You know, I've found that to be the case as well.
You know, I really thought twice before posting things
like the one about folding a fitted sheet
or about the flashlight, but you know,
people seem to respond to those more than some
of the technical ones that I do.
Yeah, I think the technical ones people file them
and file them as, yes, I know I've heard that.
And now I know where to go back and get it
if needs be.
And, you know, on those ones I've said it before,
you know, you get comments two years later,
three years later from people going, yeah,
I heard your show and, you know,
there's an easier way to do that.
Yes, there is now, but the awesome at the time.
So, you know, but these out of the ordinary shows
are like a little bit of life refreshment in between.
And now for something completely different as this.
There we go.
Yep, so the last topic was IRC etiquette
or a requested topic?
Yes, exactly.
Requested topics, just so you know,
if you want to request a topic,
you can either send a tweet as HPR
with a requested topic or on send it to the mail list
or just admin at hackerpublicradio.org
will also work.
And I might even, I'm kind of a new bit IRC.
I mean, I've done it a number of times,
but like I learned just in the last couple of weeks,
some tricks that apparently people were on old school IRC.
Right, well, I use, there's that.
But in my bill taught me over the course of a few exchanges
on IRC, how to get IRSSI,
IRC going on my server and then connect to it using T-mux.
And now these are awesome tricks that I never knew about.
I guess Bill actually did do an HPR episode about that.
And that's what I went and listened to to figure out how to do it.
But then like I couldn't figure out basic things,
like how to exit a channel without quitting all the way out
of IRC and stuff like that.
So you might be surprised how basic it needs to be
for someone even like me who's pretty good technically,
who just hasn't ever done that before.
And this is exactly why I ask it because I've got an IRSSI session
in the screen session and I go into that and that's all I do.
Because I have no clue.
Everything outside of that I have no clue.
And also I walked into the room and I was asking honky
and 5150 for stuff.
And never once thought that I might be flaming them
because it's absolutely my intention to do that.
I was having this round the cooler conversation with these guys.
But obviously that's what you should be doing.
So I should have a personal message to them, I think.
But I don't know how to do that.
So yeah, there you go.
And nor do I.
I don't know how to read.
Well, it was funny because I listened to the day.
So today's IRC logs, I will listen to I do text to speech
on the log files and I listen to those log files
and either coming home from work and stuff.
And then as I was listening to one of the days,
it was like junk ol' pits Dave Morris with a fish.
Junk ol' pits thingy with a fish.
That was quite funny.
Well, somebody has said, are you the one who set up
those shortcuts on the web interface of,
it was on augcast planet, the web interface?
Nope, don't know.
If you click the link at the bottom of the HPR website,
there's a link to augcast planet and you can log in
to the IRC on a web browser.
And that's what I did.
And there's like if you right click
or just click on somebody's ID name in the right hand column,
you have a few options, one of which is to slap them
with a fish.
And so that's what I was doing.
Excellent.
Yeah, so maybe a good topic, not only IRC etiquette,
but how to set up things like the bot responses
and I guess these are scripting things
where it's listening for certain keywords
and then it responds with pre-loaded text or something.
The HPR bot and stuff is done like that.
That's, I can see his name in my face,
but I can't put a name on him.
Hold on one second.
Crayon, of course, crayon.
Crayon, crayon.
Okay.
And he wrote the bot.
Yeah, he has the bot running.
So like he parses the HPR website and then posts the show
when the show comes out.
And I'm just, I just log in to IRC as the first thing
in the morning and I was hitting a dart
to see if anybody had left me messages in the night
because I'm pretty much out of the time zone
that there's quite a good overlap between Australia
and the US, but not so I'm kind of out of it.
So if somebody leaves me a message,
I have to hit something, send a message
before the bots realize I'm awake again.
So.
So when you say that you were listening to the logs,
do you have this red-backed you
with a text-to-speech or something?
Yeah, I do lots and lots of stuff with text-to-speech.
Just pipe it through, e-speak, and you're played.
That's pretty cool.
I've never really used it.
I mean, I use e-speak all the time in conjunction
with Blather for the various commands
that I do with my voice, but I've never really used it
as far as to consume information
that I have in text format.
Yeah, it saves my life.
I have to read lots and lots of specifications and stuff.
And you know, you go through page after page after page
of stuff, and I'll just stand up.
I'll get a stand-in desk, and I'll put on the headphones
and I'll have the PDF or whatever open,
and I'll just follow along, and then you're there,
and then suddenly you hear somebody going,
and the vendor will not be held responsible
for any damage.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, wait, hold on there.
Hold on.
Whoa, hold your horses.
And then you look at the PDF, and it's this tiny thing
snuck in and you, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's pretty cool.
Do you set e-speak to read at super high speed,
or do you, how do you deal with that?
Yeah, twice, twice, let me show you.
Two times, okay.
Interesting.
We have some additional comments to shows from before,
and this first one was on a show Raspberry Pi
Accessibility Breakthrough,
and it was by Mike Ray about quiet boot,
and what's your quiet, quiet boot messages?
Should it suddenly only start being heard
when the audio code I wrote is employed,
but to silence them, you can put quiet at the end
of the single line in bootcommandline.text.
So that's an ongoing discussion that he's having over there.
Okay.
Response to a hookah's home SSH server 1870 episode,
there was a comment by X zero X F one zero.
That's the one.
I wish people, they need to give like instructions
on how to pronounce these user names here.
The subject, it's just hex.
It's a F one zero, that's it.
I wonder what color that is.
Is that a hex color, is that a,
it could be an H, let me see.
You know, you're forcing me to go and find out what,
yeah, could be anything.
Don't bother.
But anyway, he says, yep, no clear text.
First thing is DHK exchange.
Basically, quote, no, that we speak privately
and securely, let me tell you who I, the server, am, unquote,
think about it any other way would leave the client open
to a man in the middle spoofing the server's keys.
But of course, when you ignore the change to fingerprint
on the server, you won't know who's receiving your credentials.
With pub key auth, you don't have to worry about losing
anything usable to impersonate you.
Also makes brute force login attempts
infeasible to, to the vast number of possible keys.
Egg, exactly.
Well, I don't know what happened there,
but we got disconnected from the server.
Hi John, can you hear me?
Oh, I'm back.
And Kevin's here, but he's quiet.
I'm not sure what happened there.
I was disconnected from the server
and then it kept trying to reconnect
and it was refusing the connection.
I just pinged you in the IRC channel,
but I may not have seen it yet.
Okay, well, the last you heard,
I think the last I heard was about the SSH pub key
authentication thing, the comment that I read out actually.
Man, these are a lot of comments here.
I'm running out of battery power on my laptop as well.
Okay, let's quickly go through some of them.
So we had that key exchange.
There was also a comment from Erika asking
for looks encrypted ISO command.
There was a comment by Clinton Roy,
explaining that they have an awful lot of,
they also have problems with mosquitoes and Brisbane.
And Frank posted a comment to free my music,
get music off the Mac.
Out of curiosity, and he's never used a Mac.
Why do you need a route to copy your own files?
For example, hey, yeah, post script to copy file
with a space name, you can either escape the space
with the proceeding backslash on closes in quotes.
Actually, a good point.
I wanted to mention that as well.
Yeah.
Then we had two comments to apt splunking TV time
packed in Starfish from Windigo.
The first one from was from comment from Windigo.
They're definitely not an terribly intuitive interface.
And this is related to comment of Dave Morris.
I think it applies all the actions you add to each image
and you have to very explicitly assemble a chain
and Dave replies that it seems to have a lot of potential.
He's assembled several pictures for HPR episodes.
He wants to strip the metadata and stuff.
I know that patches all about do stuff to stuff.
I do understand that do stuff, please,
but find the two stuff a bit cryptic.
Oh, yeah, honest, I don't remember what package
they say to this patch.
I'll have to go back and look and see what it is.
It was a chain in the image processing.
That was pretty good.
Oh, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So this was a Charlie Reisinger on Penn Manor
comment when Plato interviewed him and loved the interview
and Charles and LNJ put in a comment
and this basically with a link to a TEDx video.
And I watched this video and to be honest,
I was swelling up with tears at the end,
but it is so nice.
I should have missed that.
It totally escaped my attention.
I'll have to go watch that later.
Then we had a to your episode actually on open embedded media,
music textbook.
We had a comment from Frank saying,
though it's been a long time since I have to buy one,
I fully share your sentiments about college textbook industries.
The publisher blocks the path to learning,
raising their flintlocks to students and cry,
stand and deliver something like that.
I had to choke on it right now, that was it.
Yeah, thanks Frank.
And on episode QMMP, the QT based multimedia player
by Frank Bell.
Frank replied, it was nice to feel a bit nostalgia.
You make me feel old, will you?
Well, I'm old.
I've never been a senior.
I will be a cranky old man.
You're young viperschnippers,
which are new fangled media players.
And that I think is it for this month,
the rest were comments that we've already covered in the show.
Alrighty.
Anything else that we need to talk about, John?
It's probably gone on long enough.
We've tested everyone's patience to the extent that we should.
I think we're done.
I am surprised people listen through these shows,
even the ones that I do myself.
I know that people listen to them and it shocks me.
Sometimes I wonder, is there any point doing a show every month,
just about all the shows that you've heard
and all this information is freely available to everybody?
So what I think there is, because I,
I mean, there are a couple of things that we've touched on
that I missed during the month.
And I'm gonna go back and check them out now.
And I do listen to this whole episode normally,
but I of course do it at about 1.7 times speed.
And so it's not quite as long as it seems.
Yeah, true enough, true enough.
I had the reason I started in the first place was because
quite often, well, basically people don't give feedback ever.
People do not give feedback.
A lot of the feedback that you get,
there's a lot more feedback now than there was.
So if there's anything that you can do for the community,
it's to give people feedback.
There is nothing, nothing as cool
as getting somebody gone.
Hey, man, thanks very much.
Like to show that is just writing up your day,
your whole day is broken up with that.
I agree.
And people, well, sometimes I wish more people
would give feedback here on these comments
so that they would be a public,
because like I, when I first logged into the IRC recently,
I had several people in there say,
oh, by the way, I've really been enjoying your HPR episodes.
And I'm like, you know, this is the first I've heard of it
from these people.
And I'd never, you know, so it'd be cool
if they would post on the website here too,
so that we get that feedback immediately.
I will give Dave his tasks now that he's sick
to filter through the HRC logs.
I have filtered out all the comments for HR.
Oh, he'll love that as a scripting challenge.
Throwing his sons a tip across the room
when he hears that one.
But you know, you know what Dave,
you all you need to do is put the seed in the back of his mind
and he won't be able to stop himself.
Yeah, I know that about Dave.
That's funny.
Excellent stuff.
We will actually be meeting up with Dave this time next month.
Dave and I are heading over to Foster again
and bringing my nephew over to the free open source conference
in Brussels.
Awesome.
I wish I could be there.
I will be busy learning how to be the boss
in my new job here.
Yes, sir.
Well, good luck with that, John.
Thank you.
I'm a little apprehensive, but I'm going to do my best.
It probably means fewer HPR episodes,
but I'm still going to try to put the odd episode out anyway.
Yeah, also folks, I had a look at the schedule
and it was a bit scary there for a while this month.
And now that John and Huka are stepping back a little,
we do need people to jump on in and remember you
in New Year's resolution, one show a year
that's all we're asking for folks, one show a year.
Right, that hard.
No, it's not actually.
And once you get into it, it's kind of cool.
You see, come along, you do a few shows,
and then you think, hey, I wonder what people be interested
in that and then you do it.
And people love you and you're stopped in the street.
Pretty funny, what, man, it can be hard to deal
with the fame that comes from this though.
It is, it is.
Yes, indeed, yes, indeed.
All right, Ken, are we done?
All right, thank you, John.
Met a lot easier doing the show.
All righty.
It was fun.
Talk to you later, bye.
Oh, tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode
of Hacker Public Radio.
Are you going to sing that song now?
Don't us now and share the software.
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
I know I actually have to edit this
because I got three different sections to this.
I have my kids come on and say hello
cause we hadn't said hello during the new year show.
And that's now a tradition.
All right, John, all the best, see you later.
Okay, see you.
Bye.
Oh.
