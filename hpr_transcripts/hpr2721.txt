Hi everybody my name is Ken Thalon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio today for your torment.
It's the HBR Community News for December 2018 and joining me as always is Dave. How are you Dave?
I'm good thanks I might have a little cold so my voice might not be the same as usual.
Yeah I'm sure people will be fine with that so how was your month?
Well good month it's December it was December so it's always a good month.
How do you end up in this and who are you exactly and why are you here?
So I'm Janik the French guy from Switzerland and I am here because Dave is a sick so I'm going to try and replace him for this show tonight.
I don't think that's possible although I wonder after the new year what air quotes sick means.
I don't know we'll have to find that next month I guess.
Yes a little bit too much seasons greetings perhaps.
Probably.
Anyway the HBR Community News show is put on by the HBR Community just like the HBR New Year show is put on by the HBR Community
and it just so happens that a different part of the HBR Community does both.
So this month we're actually recording this after New Year's because of the weird first
Saturday before the first Monday of the month and it's basically a look at what's been going on
on the HBR Community which you are a part of dear listener and yes I am and you are as well.
So do you want to welcome the new hosts for this month?
Yes if I just can find the new hosts.
Well you're doing that I will waffle on some more.
As I was saying to tattoo on the new year show HBR is more about hosts than it is about listenership
and the reason for that is that the shows themselves are put on by the community for the community.
So I really never cared about the number of people who listen to the shows.
I'm always more interested in the number of people who are contributing to the network.
If we had a decrease of 50% listeners then I would be fine if we had an increase of 50%
listeners because the content will be there and eventually people will hear.
So new hosts this month are?
Well guess what I think Dave is really really sick because he didn't send me the list of new hosts
I'm afraid unless I have...
Do you know what do you know?
Unless I'm really mistaken but I don't think there is anything about new hosts
on these show notes I have.
Yeah we also go to the webpage which I will paste you with your page into the chat.
Yeah okay.
Oh there it is.
I found the new host singular and this is Edward Miro.
Also Cypher and I need to speak.
So very very welcome and he's already submissions his second show
which I'm absolutely thrilled about because I really enjoyed this first one
but we will talk about that anon.
So the monthly show we basically want to make sure that everybody hears at least some feedback
about their shows and we knocked off last month with the HBR community news for November 2018
and obviously we didn't say anything provocative in there at all because there were no comments
on that show.
Nope absolutely no.
That was made up for the following day with the Linux shutdown command
by JWP.
I really like the way JWP throws the shows out you know just boom against the wall
and you think hmm wouldn't have thought to do a show on that and yes people seem to like it.
Yes it was actually interesting.
I didn't know we could add a schedule shutdown for example so it's something that I don't
listen to this show.
Yes I found out that one myself a good old joke was to schedule a shutdown on
your colleagues' computer tell them what you've done and they have exactly that amount of time
to google how to cancel it.
Yeah that's good different.
That's pretty nasty all right yes.
Teachers them not to leave their PC logged locked.
Yes.
Anyway Claudio Miranda says in the comments shutdown on BSD's a nice succinct
episode one thing to note though is that the switch for power off and BSD is
dash p lower case p which is different from Linux which is dash p which is uppercase p
not sure what it is an illuminus or less luminous based distributions since I haven't used
those yet.
Yep.
Can you read the tattoos?
Yes okay so Claudio said another great JWP episode thanks for yet another straight forward
and informative episode JWP.
I always wondered about the hard thing since on Slackware I'd learned probably from the Slack book
shutdown dash h now which frankly is what I usually do too.
Yeah and Claudio continues with a response to Claudio's comment.
Open Indiana uses the original send shutdown command at the time of this writing at least.
I know a lot of CDDL stuff which I personally don't know what that means but
it seems very important is systematically getting replaced but I'm not sure if shutdown is on
at least and a common developer and distribution license.
Okay thank you it's the one son opened it up.
I talk talk talk go do it while you just go from it anyone think that I actually know
this stuff obviously you prepared this more than I did.
No I've just more used to making myself sound professional.
And Claudio said that he's going to record an episode about that so Claudio we're waiting for you.
Ha ha you want me to show all me a show Claudio hello and first Claudio is pretty good with the
old shows and then he also came back on episode 2725 my illuminate episode is 2725 enjoy and
thank you for JWP there you go a man of his word a man of his word speaking of people who
promised me shows I was going through my email old emails and chemicals a lot of people who have
promised me shows over the years you know who you are.
And it's by the way it's perfectly fine to promise me a show on one topic and send in the show
on another topic that's absolutely fine. Yes that's what I did I think.
That was my first show.
Probably yeah.
The following day we had xsv for fast csv manipulations part one.
This is written and rust it's my favorite tool from manipulating csv files by be easy.
Oh this guy is my hero absolutely.
Oh yes.
Yes I didn't know anything about this this access the tool but yeah really really interesting
really useful and oftentimes I just did some very complicated stuff with exporting
you know parsing the xsv with oak and then doing some stupid stuff this yeah this is really
really useful about and then you're like piping into this into that back and talk back into
that and then yeah but I've actually been throwing this into like group chats and stuff like
just that whole table thing where you've got xsv space table space the table and it just makes
a nice format a table that's exactly it's so nice so nice and even if you just use this to
read some xsv file produce another xsv file it's just it's incredible it's magic yeah it's
and how I didn't know about it was amazing exactly my grade says good timing what a brilliant tool
and a great show couldn't agree more this has come as a good time for me as I am deep into a large
screen scraping project which is yielding complex csv files with many columns like
BZ I frequently get involved to textual data manipulation of all kinds of formats I did not know
about xsv and have often had to guess the ordinal position of specific columns and I've had to do this
for slicing and dicing operations not easy at the best of times and time consuming all the more so
if you can't easily guess the column position because you can't see for those new to the network
my grade is one of our visually impaired contributors so the timing of the show is great for me this
is real hacking so Dave do you want to read the next one? I'm going to read the next comment
so next comment is from someone called Dave Murray so I don't know if you've ever heard of him
I don't know that was slacker yeah yeah says this is a great bit of software thanks for this I just
listened to the show and immediately thought of several applications of xsv and what I do
I have installed it and I'm learning my way around it definitely a great addition to the toolkit
and I could not agree more to Latu says Nito I didn't encounter csv all that often but this
is a great tool to know about and that was his comment and the only other thing I would say is I
find it impossible to remember the xsv three-letter clan I have no ideas fails to go into my head
so I've ended up coming back to this page about 14 times in the last week just at yes it's something
you know yeah but then I really have to learn and there's the following day bash tips 15 where Dave
explore some pitfalls when using bash loops and this is this again full show notes in his series
Dave I think I make series on anything but this one this series is really interesting I mean
I learn something almost every time just just you know some one bit here one bit there
it's it's really a really interesting series and also I usually find out I've been doing
something because it's worked and no clue why and then Dave explains it I immediately forget
then ask him again on the chat and then he tells me but I did a show about that yes I know Dave
but you're on the chat yeah all right sometimes that when I listen to the the show I realize that
I've been doing stuff in really complex ways when there's like one command to do that yeah exactly
I'm feeling a bit embarrassed at the end I imagine exactly yes I'm so neat yet
I actually want to I know he's he's put the show notes together and they're absolutely excellent
I'm looking forward to the time of just having this as a new pub somewhere where you know
the tomorrow's bash scripting book yeah that would be great as published by HPR maybe yes
obviously yes along with uh a hooker's liberal office book so that that's one that we should
do yep following episode was episode three thousand three thousand people yeah I was still
don't have a good reputation you know page why why don't we have a Wikipedia page yeah why I don't
know why I have to do everybody everybody who's technically competent enough to make a Wikipedia
page is a HPR host which is exactly the way I want it so yeah so someone should do a Wikipedia page
listing all three thousand episodes yeah um did did you get through this one or not I I you know
skipped skipped through it um yeah I was I was not in the mood of listening seven hours of
so but yeah I skipped you know just to check it out I um as you know I have a promise with
community that I will listen to every single episode and I was dreading this one you know eight
hours of seven and a half hours sped up so it was gonna be four hours of whatever so it nearly
took me away yeah but actually and it's probably just my perspective on us because I was involved
I'm involved in the network you know I'm posting the shows and stuff every single episode I
was able to remember exactly where I was listening to it at the time really wow I went back oh that's
where I learned that tip I went back to that one um yeah that was maybe four years later I used
that tip in this other job and then I pointed that episode to somebody else and somebody asked
for stem I was talking to them about that episode and actually during during the whole show at
the end of it I was really glad that I had done it because you know even things like um oh that
was Dave Morris' first show or oh wow that where's that whole scantoo that was been so long ago I
really love to hear more stuff from them you know that's what I think it is you know if you can
brace yourself for it it is it is quite cool if you've been involved in the community but
then yeah enough about yeah following day old droid go by dodo dummy mm-hmm
do you ever even heard of old droid go nope I had never heard of that but I checked checked
checked it out on the internet and uh it looks like a very nice device yeah interesting wouldn't
be my I'm not that into games but uh I know two people who are uh to do a total for one is
particularly saying it's particularly interesting I wasn't aware of uh old droid go
until listening to this episode well I don't feel so bad thanks for recording it and spreading
the information while games are fun I like games gaming it on I would imagine coding for this
device is where I would have most fun for a long time I've been fascinated about the idea of
taking my programs with me and carrying them around using them when I want to yeah I've seen that
you can you can program that it's uh Arduino compatible so it could be very interesting and we
have another comment uh from Klaatu um it's a title particularly interesting plus one I'd heard of
old rid but this has been a great review of one with lots of useful hands-on information
thanks for this eventually I assume my pocket chip I guess it's uh something similar
will die and since the company that created it is no more I can foresee wanting a replacement
there's ultra portable systems some pie-like device with a screen and some method of input
are really really useful on the 20 hour flights from New Zealand on the East Coast of USA that I
end up having to make uh sorry um I'm going to start this sentence again are really really useful
on the 20 hours flight from New Zealand to the East Coast of the USA that I end up having to make
once or twice a year for some decombs there you go there you go and we're joined by Yirun how are you doing
hello well we can't hear you not worry we'll we'll battle on yes the following day we had a
uh Yirun has seven technical issues we had episode 2702 by Tony Hughes audio audacity set up
and response to episode 2658 wherein he thanked the guys uh Dave and I think it was Dave and
Dave's and um she stayed out yes out out out out on Dave obviously yeah there's an episode
doing the excellent episode on on podcasting and how to improve audio and some of the stuff which
I still need to come back to you as you're interesting so the next day we had to do a total
fog of war in yes-sold based games this is where Dave now would correct me on the pronunciation of
that and how to implement a fog of war in a turn-based web game yeah that's its subject it's like
3000 miles above my head so yeah another flight yeah 3000 miles above the although I did follow
along with this one because of the way the Haskell I believe it's Haskell that he's writing
I mean he's such a different format to everything that I've used up until now yeah yeah I'm looking
at the shunuts right now and that yeah it doesn't look like anything I've used before but as he
is going through it I'm finding myself being able to understand what he it is that he's trying to
do but as soon as well seems you would need to actually plan yeah I tend to uh working you
start at the solution and work my way back yes so no comments on that so we'll jump on to the next
episode which was an introduction to Scribus by Tlatu and Huka says an excellent show as usual
Tlatu does an excellent job in presenting software I particularly enjoyed when he said
you could do this but you shouldn't and it's really in many situations yeah I haven't listened to
this particular show so I cannot comment directly it's an excellent show for some reason he put
into privacy and security so evidenced based medicine by my friend and yours Ahuka and Tlatu says
smart listen to this episode made me feel really smart mainly because of the all the science
terms like control group and double blind once I passed feeling like I was now an expert in
scientific studies I realized that this topic is actually a broad topic that can even in many ways
be applied to a lot of things in life possibly software testing and usability studies I'd love
to get a job sometime where I could test people's reaction to various interface designs or to arbitrary
limitations imposed in software and so forth thanks for the series I never thought myself as being
interested in the hand care and science so it's been an unexpectedly intriguing yeah I've
I haven't listened to this particular episode but I've listened to other episodes of this series and
yeah even I have the kind of the same feeling I'm not really really interesting in this kind of
subject but every episode is really interesting I think maybe because it's it's personal you know
it's not just the he's not just talking about subjects he's talking about his experiences and
that's that's really interesting and he says stuff that's correct yes yeah yeah we have another
comment on this episode by ahuka which is actually a response to the comment thanks for the
comment clear to I guess this works because I always pick topics I'm interested in and I suspect
that it it is what makes it interesting to us which is exactly what I was saying just before perfect
so the following day we had some crazy Dutch guy don't know yeah yeah god this guy someone
who comes on the shirt keeps thrown in shows now about the AS400 key and someone
apparently cannot use mumble correctly so we don't know we're messing with you room and he talks
about the IBM S400 and believe it or not I have used the S400 in the past yeah this brought back
a lot of memories and also explained quite a lot about the S400 I think now if I was going back
to my then self I would be a lot more enthusiastic about the green screen I was at the time I guess
anyone which is old enough I won't give a definitive number but we and been in computers jobs
since a long time everyone has used some AS400 well you know you room could come on here but he
a tech fail with his mic but I'm lucky I really like this Bob says novel not AS400 it was a
novel server okay oh this is the one where he says it was built into a wall but I think the point
was well taken okay next to me reliable machines yeah never mind oh sorry so I remember we had
a our AS400 it cost like two million somehow yeah and it was in the middle of our computer room
and I was just sitting there like a you know three black fridges with you know three flashing lights
and then over on the other side were a whole gold old crappy 286 machines that we had run
CC mail you know with a with a batch script batch scripts running on you know a computer rack with
loads and loads of monitors around and anytime we would come in and do the tour of the computer
people would just stand for hours in front of these 286's because they looked cool so yeah okay
those were the good times yeah and this one is the yeah it's boring black machine okay what yeah
and now we have Raspberry Pi's that yeah yeah there might be a might have lots of computing power that
it could probably replace lots of stuff we were doing on those big machines anyway we have
another comment by Kla2 about the intro music so I love this retro version of the intro music
really cool episode two I was not familiar with the AS400 and I don't know much about
my friends so this was a fascinating overview thank you and Windigo says as certainly piqued my
interest thanks for an informative episode I bumped up against AS400 a few times in my life
but never managed to find out what they were all about I feel this was a great intro and I
will be poking around the museum to learn more so actually I would like to get some more
info about this and also I meant to comment that I'd like you room see you in a zizan
there's text files dot com will assist in archiving old tapes and stuff so they if you have
old versions of operating systems for AS400 or whatever then you can rip the stuff and put it
up on archived.org as part of the project and he has done some shows as well on here all right so
next day very so you're doing says in the chat friend of mine is nays 4 100 glue and has all his
tapes digitized and loaded to AWS perfect and you can transfer them over to internet archive as well
they keep them for posterity and they also replicate them around I think Delft is doing
not because of text files because of licensing issues they take care of the licensing issues
for you so that you don't have to worry about cool he says excellent I haven't no folks I'm not
having a one-way chat I've been talking to you in here on the you are the voice you are the voice
of urine um stegger analysis 101 by Edward Miro cypher oh what sexy show notes oh I love these
show notes man oh man oh man yeah very comprehensive search notes and be easy says great show thank you
for this this intro to stegger now for stegger now for the thingy where you hide things and things
it is a topic that I've heard of and given this little pause until the show I'm interested in what
you will come up with for your next episode yeah and Claire to say great intro thanks for this
excellent overview I find stegganography fascinating but never thought about the workflow
this episode is a great way to focus on the steps and tools involved cool so the next day ghost
script talks about manipulating pdf's with gs and pdf stapler yet again that who seems to have
miss file is under privacy and security that's so unlike that too how about honing a one show for
each show that is well missed categorized and the following day we had arrays and bash part one
where Dave went back and edited out my comment about arrays and bash this time it's personal
because he's ran out of run out of further auxiliary bash tips and arrays yes this is also
excellent series we've already spoken yeah and youtube downloader for channels this was a
blow up on the hookers episode 2675 where you can download an entire channel yeah and I love
this this series on youtube's from from many contributors actually because yeah that's true
youtube kind of shows you tries to show you what they think you want but sometimes you really want
something and it's not what they show you so yeah those those tools are the scripts and those
episodes are really interesting as a series and I certainly have learned lots of stuff
listening to those episodes cool and we're looking for episodes on people's recommendations for
youtube channels it's the same as podcast subscriptions and if somebody wants to help me out with
how to post hpr episodes on to youtube that would be super awesome as well well I can do that if
you want I can't look into it I have I have two months of fairly serious stuff going on and then
hopefully after that I will be able to dedicate more time to puttin in some planning as to how we're
going to modernize the hpr workflows a little bit so if you can hold your horses until then yeah
no problem anyway do you want to read the commenter yes of course so there's one command by
Gustaf said thank you nice one this will come in handy thank you for posting and you're very
welcome thank you Gustaf raspberry pi 3a plus review yeah by so weird guy from Switzerland is he
French is he from Switzerland yes I don't mind like that other world while he was Irish from
living in Netherlands come on do you have sweet Swiss citizenship or not without a thing not yet
I I should have I should have gotten it that's correct yeah yeah this year but unfortunately
you need to be married for five years and well I didn't stay married for long enough so I'm
going to have to wait for five more five more years and then we'll have this yeah but I know
do the cantons get to vote on us do the people have to vote on us or not are you not living that
canton I have to be 10 years in Switzerland to get this citizenship and since I'm from France it's
going to be how did you say that in English it's going to be not not automatic but simplify
process yes but I heard some some Dutch lady who didn't get her citizenship because they
uh the people in the council where she lived the actual citizens had had to vote and they voted
against her because yeah that depends where you live in Switzerland in the different areas and
it might even depend on on the the very in the not the not the town but they call that district
something yeah yeah so because Switzerland is a federated country so laws might be slightly
different from one area to the other I know here in in Chatelle sorry there's no votes I think but
there's a a a review by some authorities and you know they're they're to try to determine if
you're well integrated if you speak the the language here it's it's French here so if you speak
French correctly if you're well integrated which means if you have a a a a long time job if you
maybe here I have a house so I have a daughter so I guess I'm integrated here so it should be okay
cool okay uh the following episode was a Raspberry Pi review which was an excellent review
if I may say so not least of which because of the photos that you put in it's really nice to see
I had now yeah realized how low profile that could be which might be very useful yeah the
A plus if you if you use the the right under angle bracket it's it's it's yeah it's really low profile
yeah it's a little less powerful than the then the the the the the the B plus the B plus in terms
of memory does have the memory I think but it's still still it's got Wi-Fi now yeah and that makes
it very attractive actually from I never really saw a reason for the A versus a B you know if you
had to do everything with Ethernet so now but now this this does actually put give it a nice
niche between the pi zero and the B there's exactly yeah it's yeah it's it's beginning to float my
bolt a little bit because they the pi zero there's so many compromises on it that you it's nice for
what it is but there are so many compromises yeah the the pi zero is something that you would I guess
used to get data from from some sensors and then send those data to a more more powerful
device or our server while on the A plus you can actually do some computing right on the chip like
for example stick a webcam in there and do some some image detection on the device before
sending it to I don't know a MQTT server for example yeah cool very nice you you sold me on this
was that the first podcast now nope that was the second second to what now yeah first one was the
git my my git workflow and the following day it's not too wraps up his mini-series on stagnant
steg nerd steg a nography steg anography that's one so he says did you find that his messages
contained in tattoos previous two shows if not tattoo really reveals how to find them so it's
actually worth a challenge and confluence says did anyone win we need to know yeah and then
a shot full bull guide bull guy sorry said great episode series so it worked out too if
you're ever in this incinerity area I'd like to buy you a beer and pick your brain Scott short
and fast bull guy already has a tall lanky dude with lots of hair just just using his
handle there as a disguise yeah so I have to keep track of them on the date numbers because
because Dave is down and punches down on me if we don't if we go ahead too far so I'm having to be
nice and responsible here resources in four x games which is another Haskell show by Turo Dodo
and this is where he is going through the various different parts of building a game which is
kind of cool and it seems Haskell is a very efficient language looking at the way he's writing this
because the amount of stuff he's getting to do here building his object but I'm again
yeah he's international space station sort of level actually that looking at those those
show notes and the code in there it makes me feel like I'm gonna have to have a look at Haskell and
try to do some some stuff with it just to just you know just to know how to do it yeah exactly
then you can come on special to comment on his shows the following day we had Brian in Ohio and I
thank you thank you thank you thank you and Brian is a pilot and didn't tell her on the
of us and hasn't done any shows on piloting and how to start an airplane technical aspects of it
how to learn things you need to know calculations stuff you're bringing on an airplane
kish kish kish kish kish you think you know somebody yeah and then all of a sudden
but this was unfortunately in well unfortunately in response to the fact that there was a
aircraft crash and the people on the news have been misreporting what a stall is and this was an
excellent yes excellent guide to others I even understood it without having to go to the links
yeah I agree it was very interesting especially the the the part where when you say that
does this angle of attack that is doesn't even have anything to do with how the plane is
related to the ground yeah which was what I originally thought but I was wrong yeah yeah well
and then when he said it kind of made perfect sense because yeah yeah it's obvious so pretty cool
um about own app which was the linux foundation project and DWP I had a good fortune to get some tickets
to go to this event but wasn't able to go due to some health issues I was having at the time
and he goes a quick rundown on the on the about the networking event and then about the
ONAP basically what they're trying to do with it which is open network automation platform which
is attempting to basically do to you know due to networking configuration what darker containers
and Kubernetes and stuff like that are trying to do in the field of computer infrastructure
hmm I'm not a network guy so I didn't understand understood I understand yeah I didn't understand
everything he said but yeah it's so it's really interesting to report on the on the events and
things that are going to probably be the standard in the future yeah exactly and then we had
tasha doing a short episode on how to gather your or SS feeds from youtube which is something we were
talking about earlier yeah another one really interesting in this whole youtube series and be
easy said already put this one to use great episode have already started using this tip in my tiny
tiny or SS instance and tasha was tasha was saying that he may he noticed that I had put in
and I had staggered episodes in and that I had put another one in and a you don't need to worry
about that sort of thing because this hbr and people will have two different takes and what this
actually fits in perfectly in between my two episodes so this works out absolutely awesome
just like the stegna stegna we were three one hits in the middle of the two series explaining what
it was so I was like did they did those two guys plan that so that was it for the shows
then we had of course the new year show which was a live event going on did you manage to get
answer now no I was on vacation at my parents house and so I was not able to to join but maybe
next year I don't know what I'm doing next year but yes certainly something that I would like to
take part in if I can next year yeah it'll be go up to 70 year in a row Kevin and honky from basically
the host who also holds the Linux logcast show basically did all the work didn't have to do
anything so thanks again community members can come on and help out and there were some other
comments that came in after the previous shows so start with episode 1536 which is 150 in one
electronics arts projects which was from 2014 there's no no I do say that expiration date on
the it's absolutely not absolutely not and this is this is exactly this is exactly the sort of
thing that I love because you know huh you get a comment like this and you go what 2000 I did that
episode doing what says no three years ago or something so do you think people do you think there
are people who do you call it bench listening let go back to episode one and listen to three thousand
and whatever episode there's on the on HBO yes I know there are I know there are
you do that and that's the way to do it yeah well that's our way to do it the thing about it is
it's I've been trying to do the same thing with the EEB blog which is an electronics show on the
published two blog video blogs a week or something and it's just there's not enough time in the day
unless you're like yeah I remember back when I was a student and you know I was feeding you know
rubber duck machines that you know feeding bars into uh all kinds of blades and stuff and
if I had podcasting back then you know life would have been just so much easier the amount of work
that you you know you do manual boring work on the farm just listening to podcasts as you go
but if people are doing that but again there'd be too late now because they've already finished
but if people are doing that going back to listen from show number one can you keep up with the tags
so that's how we know people are doing it Davis is doing a great job but they adding tags to the old
shows yeah anyway Richard Harris says consultant license technical instructor in the heartland
info web pages I posted now this sounds like an ad but it was it sounded very much like spam
but Dave and I both decided that no it wasn't spam it's basically he's got a full
list to the various different types of kits where he's broken them and down so uh I'll give you
some synopsis it's a bit uh chatty it's my quick guide to the best 150 project kits with their
list organized from the most basic to the most advanced of the 69 best projects uh for people
learning electronics this should help electronics beginners and novices struggling to learn
electronics with the poorly organized manuals which starts with rather advanced topics and
gathers the basics all over the place as a tech instructor looking into hand my old kits to a newbie
though I thought I'd take the time to sort it out for him and this is the result the at the bottom
is a chart of lengthy tips collection of tips for novice experimenters whether using these kits
or not so if you're any way interested in electronics follow this link it's very good
Richard if you are listening please please please do some shows first thank you yeah it sounds
like there's uh lots of material here it's for a HBR show cool why duck book uh tattoo says
column size is the own episode yeah he said uh uh dogbook rocks and there's a link to dogbook.rux
which is a you are a httbs column slash dot dogbook dot rox it's a neat site talking about dogbook
and how great it is cool nice he's keeping up his own uh hey you read technology
this microphone didn't work on my ass for 100 yeah yeah I was installing mumble on my my own
ass for 100 and um yeah for some reason the RPG compiler just couldn't understand the PTT
door so I know I don't know I lost last last week I mean new year's Eve I was everything was
going great fine happy you know I was on mumble and we had a blast in a way and uh this this
evening I tried it and well no joy with with with the microphone uh so I switch to another
work session and of course uh and I this is this is my beef with windows it always decides that it
wants to update and it never asks you for but this time it happened with me on a Ubuntu system which
is of course uh a way better as an operating system but anyway it's so of course of course but I
couldn't install mumble because um he was updating its software so I was like tapping my uh my
desk as uh in agony and but I'm here I am so are there any questions left this is this is where
you have to always run Ubuntu and stop choosing windows so you can update your system every day and
you don't have to wait for uh 15 minutes yeah but that's it this isn't a Ubuntu system and yet
when I booted it just now it's it in the background it did an unattended update yeah
so I couldn't install mumble because there was a global lock on on the package installer
but but it could and I did does the automatic security upgrades when you boot yeah well I
I said it that way I know I could disable it but uh yeah it kind of saved the story so I wouldn't
I wouldn't I would just leave that but uh as I said I would just run Ubuntu every day 24
hours a day so I wouldn't have this kind of problem yeah well all my systems run Ubuntu
and if ever I have a uh windows need I have a visual machine facial machine with windows
stem on it sometimes you know they're always but but most of the time my life revolves around
using Ubuntu for my daily job cool so we're going through the comments for the month I'll put a
link to wherever going from into the show notes or into the chat one second do you want me to read
the next comment why do you do that yeah go ahead yeah okay so it was about an episode I bought
a laptop by uh and what was that it's clay clay clay clay clay okay uh episode that was published
in May of 2018 and the comment was by clay clay himself and they said this is an episode but I'll
answer very quickly here uh so I don't have the question but uh answer number one
invoice in piaque cryptocurrency as a medium for transferring value uh two yay that's why we didn't
do that if currency needs to be all of medium for value transfer store of value and unit of
accounting to be currency then most row cryptocurrency simply isn't currency and the third
uh answer was oh yes so I encourage you to go back to episode 2562 and read the questions and then
you will understand those response well the questions come from 50 on 50 in the comment
just write about that okay so uh you said when you paid in cryptocurrency was question number one
yeah what happens if the bottom drop is out and the third one is uh as volatility
in the cryptocurrency market affected your financial status yep okay cool and he's doing an
episode on that did you see that that that's promising me an episode so the next comment is on
a show a gentle introduction to quilt by bjb and the comment was by tattoo can't wait to try it
quilt sounds really great can't wait to try it thanks for the great episode
yeah next we have a comment on an episode by someone called german something
you know again this guy again yeah running your own mainframe on linux for fun and profit i guess
that was your first episode i guess german yes it was um and actually it i i've never made or
listened to a podcast prior to that and some guy at orcamp asked me to um let's say convert or
migrate my talk i did there to a podcast so that was my first experience ever with doing a podcast
and boy did it change my life you did great on this first episode if i'm anything so oh well
welcome to my world so the comment was posted by clatu and he said based best explanation of what
a mainframe is that's what that's title of the comment i've asked i've skimmed and we keep it
your pages but until you explain the isolation of the main cpu with controllers for other tasks
i've never understood exactly what a mainframe was so thank you also thanks for the clear explanation
of how to get started with this i heard about the open mainframe project and kind of puked around it
but i think i'll give air kudos ago before open mainframes what's that zoe it says that how do you
promise that so what do you mean it says is going to give air kudos ago before open mainframes zoe is
that uh some projects from open mainframe zoe no idea no idea no no doesn't ring a bell by me
anyway okay well probably he knows what he meant so that that's that that's all good joy is toy is a new
open source main open source software framework that provides solutions that allow development
and operational teams to securely manage control script and develop on the mainframe like any other
cloud platform zoe is the first open source project based on z slash os uh okay uh okay well
zos of course is that currently the the the go to os on mainframes because there's only one supplier in
the world uh IBM and they're supplying zos with it if you have places and the hardware so uh
well there's this there's funny there is also this other project it's called open mainframe and
it's a project by the linux foundation which of course is renowned for uh it's it's main developer
linux store vaults and um so they do a lot of open source projects and so when you you hear the word
open mainframe you think okay that's cool and they even have a guy assigned to to run that project
but mainly what they try to do is uh it's the sort of um um well let let let let's let's be not
political you let's not be political correct today and just say it's a sort of a marketing
channel for IBM to lure people to to the mainframe saying oh you look weak you can also run your
open source project on our closed hardware closed os and uh please come in and rejoice um which
is of course uh it's it's it's I think it's pretty ludicrous cool mainframe I can see mainframe
wars coming out here mm-hmm well I I won't avoid a good rent when I fr i can never never let a good
rent uh make make that an episode of hpr exactly yeah there was a comment to tattoos uh my music
production set up uh 26 61 and it was um nice look behind oh and that was told you Miranda's
show about yeah uh basically setting up basically every every tool on the world related to open source
music production and nice look behind the scenes this was a fascinating peak behind the scenes
I love hearing how open source musicians produce their music and I love the samples of the music
at the beginning the very cool which it was next there was a comment on uh mirror shades uh
slackware post install episode by clatu again a very uh very prolific in uh his comments uh comments
titled Shameless Self Promotion great episode on slackware thanks I have written a guide on the post
install process here and then he gives a URL sorry I should probably go to the slackwiki and merge it
into the official docs but I'm not sure what the protocol is for that uh for a total rewrite of
someone else's content anyway it's available in the slack made slacker media handbook and covers
most of the absolute necessary tasks as well as some gooey customizations well the funny thing here
is slackware project the project leader of the slackware project is a former colleague of mine
when uh yeah well Eric Hamelius and um he curly works at sml in felthove in the Netherlands
but we were colleagues for approximately two years back in when was that 189 yeah 8889
so long time ago but I never heard a saw him in the open source in the suddenly he just popped up
on a on a event I was organizing and uh yeah look I'm the project leader of slackware yeah of
course who doesn't know slackware you know if you've been around in in open source for a long time
yeah it's the first go to grant time you should ever yeah so that was pretty pretty cool I'm um
yeah I'm well I'm not star struck yet but I'm a little proud that I know him let's put it like that
next time you see him throw a microphone and our phone in front of his face and get a recording
oh that's a nice idea yeah we get them in with the thing you'll podcast and then we spread
the virus out among others it works that's clear um this was a comment on uh
Tlatushal Portias uh cool things you can do installing on a thumb drive and uh there was a come
there by Alesson uh and it was about live media and the question is um I would also be fond
to test drive Linux uh PC laptops uh computer stores what's that oh no it would be fun to at least
try and reboot the machine but don't things like network proxy configuration screw ups such
temps it was one question do staff not want to stop you booting up uh computers doesn't secure
boot get in the way I'm curious therefore tattoo on what kinds of systems uh has this approach
being useful older or pre-secure boot PCs to which tattoo replies
latest response better than no response sorry Alesson I only just saw your comment network proxy
things I don't have any trouble with it but I also have a VPN available to me maybe that gets around
some wonky network setups I have not had problems in airports university so tell conferences centers
or really anywhere I can really think of test drive Linux in a store I do this as a matter of
habit if I'm in a store with computers for sale I usually reboot at least one PC to Linux just
to keep tabs on what works out of the box these days it seems rare for UFI to display models to
be locked down so I open the UFI UI disable secure boot reboot to Linux test off and then
re-enable secure boot to avoid what would be vandalism I have no interest in giving
leading skigs a bad name keep your eye on that one he'll break our display models
until corporate sends somebody to fix them I've only been approached reprimanded once for doing this
I calmly explained that I was testing Linux which is required for work because I was considering
a purchase the salesperson did not stand down so I calmly rebooted and later sent an email
to the store manager telling him that Linux was a real OS that real people in the area used to work
so the sales teams ought to be made aware of it I have had a problem since I haven't had a problem
since in that store warehouse stationery in New Zealand for the record otherwise no one has ever
bothered to approach me about it I guess if I'm nervous about it I will try to find a sales
person and explain what I need to do and why and when they ask if I may demonstrate the process
walking them through everything as I did it fans throwing fancy words around like programmer
and software developer and sees plus plus might help dazzle them into submission either way it's
worth a shot end of comment that was worth an opinion in itself I have gone into medium art uh
urune and basically gone up and asked them and they went yet I know Linux and I don't care
you're brave for men you're brave for men than I am for going into medium art yeah exactly
but they have been very good about just they usually they go oh yeah uh bubble over there and
bubble come over and have a few minutes discussion about various different distrails and what
they recommend but yes nine times of the time you either get the guy you know stuff or they just
don't care because they're not paid enough to care yeah so that was it pretty much for comments
mm-hmm he gets very annoyed if we go over the comments we've already discussed so we better not do
this so yeah so next uh comment we have was uh by someone named Ken Fallon on bandit update by
ny bill and the comment is use the website you are supposed to read the website at the start of
the next level yeah I think we've already covered those last time so really we skipped all those
he has he has already not to volunteer as comments marked in green were read at the last
community news show yeah well this one this one is not green all right oh okay we'll continue on then
sorry sorry yes what did I say was it on the use oh yeah yeah you said you're supposed to read
the website at the start of the next level that's what you said my bill says who I'm not sure what
you mean Ken it's not a question if it's a statement I do read the website at the start of
the next level by the way if anyone got to above 27 last time well they changed 26 so there is a
nice extra bit of a challenge to get to that level now too currently stumped at 32 for three days
now have fun yeah and then you replied I took it to be a hacking challenge so I approached it from
the point of view that this was a system we needed to access and had to figure out the answer
without clues I don't know where I got this idea but I thought I heard someone explain it like that
if you get stuck then go to the website so I was stuck on six for a long time as a result now what
11 the problem now I searched for some tool I know I need plus something I need to answer the
result was obvious but I now feel like I cheated so I'm deciding if I should come up with
oh sorry I'm going to start that again so I'm deciding if I should come up with another solution
yeah so I'm not a solution to the way that I found out to do it my bill says webpage
ah I see I was referring to the over-the-wire link I put in the above there really isn't
any way to know what's expected of you in this level some levels leave you in an empty home
some levels you need information from the WTW page which you copy and paste in yes I guess you
were having quite a hard time without reading that yes I was I know I said that if you get really stuck
there are websites out there are full of banded solutions but I don't feel reading the
O-O-T-W website that's where it's held hosted for the level goal and then researching commands or tools
to solve it on your own is cheating how else would we learn any new stuff figure out what needs
to be done and how things work and then manipulate us and hacking so I'm currently did you leave
level 11 and went up think we can feel that you are looking at this one second yeah well I'm going
to read the next comment in the meantime so it's a comment by Klaatu on how it has problem with studies
and Klaatu said this ought to be required listening for everyone before they are
allowed on the internet or out of their front door which sounds quite maybe extreme but why not
no he's absolutely right and Kevin says who was also hooker finding the truth many years ago
I was told by a professor that all really important questions come down to
see terminology i.e. how do we know what we know I have come to see the truth in that statement
I'm glad you also see that Klaatu so cool and I'm up to level 26 I figured out why I figured out
something but I still haven't managed to break out of the something just for anybody who's done
level 26 and is that is we're done yeah we're done no we're not well there was two items on the
melt thread one was a community new show and the other was about the new year and furthermore
we if you can help with help out with a tagging that would be great if we are going back listening to
older episodes it just takes a few minutes to write some tags about what what was in the shows
and that really helps it really helps a lot actually because especially during the episode 7,000
I was able I was able to get some lot of information just based out of the tags
so as we do every year now it's a tradition we would like to thank all the contributors in 28

Yannick, the French guy from Switzerland whose handle could be a lot shorter if he tried.
Yeah, you can change that to Yannick, it's going to be okay.
So that's it folks.
That was a H.V.L.A. community news for December 2018 and Happy New Year to you all.
And there are 260 clean, spanking fresh slots available for you, the listener.
Make that.
That's right.
Go ahead.
I was going to make that $259 because I'm going to reserve, well, not reserve, but post a show
soon.
Excellent.
So if you have been struggling last year, you give up smoking this year before you give
up beer and you're wondering, past New Year's resolution, could I possibly do?
Yes.
Send us in that effing show that you've been meaning to do for the last decade.
So tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of Hacker Public Radio.
Hacker.
Yeah.
Probably.
Well, just a little side note on the last.
So I've been producing or putting out podcasts approximately monthly since my first one.
And I have one idea left and after that, I'm currently blank on the subject.
But other than that, there's one thing I will be moving from one house to the other somewhere
around the beginning of February.
So before I have everything set up again and being able to record podcasts can take a little
while.
So I don't think I have loyal listeners by now.
And I don't think I'm that famous.
But well, you know, in some time, I'll pop up on the screen again, Gerald.
You have no excuse.
You have on your pocket at the older devices you need to record a podcast.
Your phone.
Nah.
This is it.
I want a bit more decent quality recording.
And the audio is better than no audio is a little shorter and we all we ask from people
is one show a year, just one show a year.
If you do one show a year, then any guilt trip you have for me is gone.
So that's all you need to do one show a year.
Okay.
So I've done, I've done four.
So that means that I was last year again.
No, no, no, no.
It was the last two thousand and like a two thousand twenty three.
Okay.
It doesn't work like that.
Yeah, sure does.
Well, anyway, that's if if I'll wait three hour, three years or four years, that's
so much past the Brexit due date, probably maybe you even rejoined again.
Well, here's the thing.
If you're stuck for stuff to do, rewiring your new house, experiences, any tech experiences
that you're coming up against, any weird things that you have to do in the Netherlands,
that you don't have to do in other countries, moving your case, how to safely shut down
an AS400, the various different parts in the NAS400, where you could buy an AS400, what's
how to connect up the monitors, how to get that, what's the terminal eliminations that
you should use to connect to your AS400, how to go into the ring to the internet, how
to use it.
Please, no more.
No more programming.
And AS400.
There you go.
Stop.
Guys.
I know I get this question from people.
I'm running out of podcasts ideas up there.
I know there's all the HBR website, there is a list of subjects that people can can take
as an inspiration.
Yes, but if you want personal ones, I will personally give people personal based on the shows
that they've done up to now, all the stuff that I would like to hear more about what
they're doing.
Oh, okay, okay, okay, well, you just sent me an email with your personalized thoughts
and I'll be more than happy to oblige.
One last thing, I said it already at New EZ, but my next podcast will be about being a
Volative Firefighter.
I've been that for 10 years, and of course, that means training and exams and certification.
So let's say I know some stuff about helping people in need, and I think that will be
a nice subject.
It's of interest hackers, for sure, particularly me because I, yeah, cool, yeah, it's really
hacking.
I mean, you take a chainsaw and you go on to a car or okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
put it safe for the episode, yeah.
Okay, okay, okay, I will.
Okay, tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of Yerun says hacker.
Hacker?
Yannick says.
I said, Bibli, and I say radio, okay, should we try doing that again?
Tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of Hacker, Bibli, radio, yeah, happy to
be here.
Share the software, you'll be free hackers, you'll be free, Yannick, please don't delete
the recording until I want afterwards.
Thank you guys.
It's been a ball.
I'm going to go and have a beer.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
