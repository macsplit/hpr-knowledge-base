Good day and welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
My name is JWP and today I want to talk to you about a server that I built.
I had an old server at work and I needed to do something new with it.
What's the purpose?
I had an old Windows backup workstation at work and I did a lot of backup with it over
the years.
It got to a point where it was too slow and low-spec to handle Windows 7 updates.
What I would do is update it and I'd come back a couple of days later and be start everything.
It just got to be too much.
My company had switched to 365, SharePoint and OneDrive and with OneDrive I can keep all
of the backups that I would have normally kept in the email there and also over the course
of the last year I think it went up to two to a terabyte on the OneDrive and three gigabytes
or so on the exchange server.
I didn't need to backup and keep and do a search thing anymore and it had become dangerous
because I dreaded to do the updates.
With such a low-spec thing I was really tempted just to put it into the recycle bin at work
but I didn't really want to throw it away because a long time ago I had sprung for
160 gigabyte hard drive for my own money and I know I purchased on a hard drive for work
but at the time it seemed like a really good idea and it saved me a lot of time and back then
there were just four gigabyte drives in it.
I think at first of course it was run at XP until XP didn't work anymore and then I moved it
to Windows 7 and it just got really really slow and so my first problem I was pretty sure was
that it was only 32 bit and I wasn't exactly sure about how to figure that out but I had to
do some research the first before I even figured it out so it was there was no sentos which I would
normally use or Sousa both of which I use at work because I had last a really long time
Sousa and sentos both last eight years and so that means that I just do it and I could have
went for Dora but again I wanted a really long time of support so it came down to
Ubuntu 1604, Davien with the i36 or netbst with the i386 option that I could use long-term and
I'm very comfortable with Ubuntu and why why Ubuntu server versus Ubuntu desktop and again I didn't
really with one gigabyte of RAM I really didn't want to run Unity with one gigabyte of RAM
and Mate was just not along enough the support cycle for me three years I don't want to set this
up and I don't ever ever you know have to try to figure out how to install anything again I want
the next time just to take it to the recycle bin and be done with it so the
um so it's a small form factor computer and so I carried it home and downloaded the 32-bit ISO
and I had a similar problem with my transmitter box it only boots from CD so I had
but I had a built-in DVD in this little little machine already and it worked it worked and so
to confirm that it was 32-bit like I thought I had to use the you name on its A and I had to look
in the proc the proc directory under the CPU to see where it was and it had a little i if it
didn't have an i in it or l in it the it didn't it doesn't work work work work work well and so the
let's see what is it so you have to grep flags use the grep command grep flags slash proc
slash CPU info and that's just a text file and you look for the lm and if it has
lm is found in the output of the CPU is 64 bit if you don't see an lm or i at 386 or i
46 or i 586 or i i x86 output and it's a 32-bit 32-bit thing so I didn't see the lm and I
didn't see any of that other stuff and then also the the if you use you name on its A it'll have
it'll show say quite clearly if it's 64 bit or not just a simple you name on its A and
and I put the links in the in the show notes and the show notes for that and okay and so then
so that so then i've got it and and i was glad that i had it at home and i had a
little weekend and i had a a ton of trouble i don't have very good lap skills in a moment and so
i had a lot of trouble with getting owned slash next cloud built both with snaps and the straight
install and i broke the install several times i couldn't get the and it always seemed to come
down to i couldn't get the sql server uh right no matter what i tried uh and it seemed to be
a a Ubuntu problem uh it was specific to Ubuntu with the pro postgres then i i couldn't get it
right and so finally i just got frustrated and i gave up um and so so that was like well what what
what can i do i'm on my skills and they're Ubuntu in the moment i can't get it i can't get it right
and so i said uh um so what what can i do right now and what would be interesting and something
that i know will work and so what i did was i did a clean install again and i did uh put open
sql server in it uh i installed tight uh tight vnc server i i uh got an xfce4
image on there and i put ff impact in there in youtube minus dl and you get um
and i plan to only in the future play with snaps so if the snap doesn't work well then i just
uninstall the snap and i try something else if i want to play with it um i used a digital ocean
article about how to put vnc on Ubuntu and the article even that was written in 2016 it's not
100 percent so but it was close enough uh you know close enough for me to do it and what i
recommend is that you not put the vnc server on the auto on the auto load that you just sshn
and type vnc server and then connect that way because i found that the memory usage was much higher
if you had it auto start uh if you had it if i had it auto start um and if you have to kill it you
have to kill it um and why would i need it if i use youtube dl well youtube dl doesn't work
with every site whereas if i use uh you get it gets every every data and then with ff impact i can
transcode and since even though it's a slow old 32 bit uh it's not a primary driver and i can
i can with ff impact i can transcode uh all the video over time no no issue and there's a lot of
usb ports on this thing so i just put a stick in it and it transfers everything over to the uh stick
and i take it home and that you know it's my entertainment for the weekend or uh a learning block
so what is this a youtube uh dl um okay and it's uh it's it's a youtube dl is a command line program
to download videos from youtube.com and a few more sites it requires a python interpreter uh 2627
or 32 and it is not uh platform specific so it'll work on a unix box a windows box or macOS
and it's released to the public domain which means you can modify it redistribute or use it however you
like um in the future with this uh machine uh i really would really really like to get own cloud
to work and uh in another video another podcast uh i'll make the choice between using own cloud with
central west or using own cloud with the boon two but i've had a lot of trouble with my own cloud
and a boon two and it could just be me that i'm not very good at post grass or whatever
and i'm going to try my best to get it to work uh with central west and and see if it'll work
because that's what it said is it's a on the web page that it was primarily uh that they recommended
red hat server for it and uh for commercial applications and that the red hat was their primary
partner in commercial ventures now they have a lot of raspberry pie stuff too so i may give that a try
um so other possible projects is this uh uh STORJ uh storage i think and uh so what what it is
is is you get uh you sort of rent your storage on your disk drive uh to this cloud company
and they have like boxed-age storage and they'll give you like some of their
their searchers uh their currency and for letting you use part of your hard drive and uh i listen to
some other guys talking about it on the web and some of them off their 32-pit SD card
were getting like uh ten dollars every three months off of that and so i i have uh i don't know
a hundred hundred gigabytes free on that little drive and so if i can get it through the firewall
and that's free power uh i might i might give that a try just to mess around with that and see
i also have to check with the hr and make sure that that it's it's okay with them uh uh probably
it'd be okay uh to learn anything i want to with it as long as i don't make any money so i may have
to just set it up and not uh collect any any money from it uh let's just see how it works um
um and uh well that's that's really it uh so i did that project and uh i had a lot of
trials and tribulations again with that that home cloud or our next cloud server and um
uh in particular with the boom too and and and uh i had a lot of uh enjoyment with that
youtube dl and fm impact thing and i think that that's going to be really really good
