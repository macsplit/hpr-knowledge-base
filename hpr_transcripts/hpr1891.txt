Hi everybody. My name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
It's Halloween and the gremlins are out because I just have been trying to record a show
on the mumble server and a hookers having connectivity issues and then we went and recorded with
my daughter of nine years old who got 25 minutes in and I realized that I hadn't pressed the push
to talk button. So now I'm winging it on my own as Dave Morris is off enjoying himself at
odd camp. Actually he's working extremely hard. Big shout out to the guys there at
the HBR table who I believe is Macnull and Chalcom and of course through is streaming it for us
well on a webcam taking a picture every five minutes or so. So it looks like they're having a nice
time. I'm really really really miss not being there. There's some amateur radio stuff I saw
that I would have loved to have a look at. So there you go. But we will continue on. We will
continue on. We will continue on. Hacker Public Radio. Yes what it is what it was. Hacker Public Radio
is a community podcast network just for those of you who don't know. It means that we're all in this
boat and we are all in this boat and if you want to record a podcast you can. In fact not only
are you allowed to do it you're actually encouraged to do it and we're not allowed to say anymore
that you're required to do it because you're not. It's CC by SA so there's no onus on anybody but it
kind of makes logical sense if nobody starts contribution shows then yeah we don't have any shows
basically as simple as that. So what we do here once a month we take some time out to discuss
what's been going on in the community. Behind the scenes or maybe if you're not on mailing list or
if you didn't catch all the shows and you think hey I'd like to go back and listen to that
then that's what this show is all about. The first thing we do of course is we welcome our new host
and thankfully this month that Dave is away and who is not here to help us out. I will have the
traditional butchering of the names but fortunately I think this month it should be okay although
my daughter gave it earlier on pronounced all these names differently than I would have done.
So Klacky, Marlowe Kano, Just Me and the Love Bug all submitted a show for the first time
and we welcome them all with wide open arms so we'll quickly just nip on through some of the
talking about each of the shows that there were. And the first one up this month is a N My Bill
who has a icon or a avatar of a monkey holding a gun which was very amusing for my new year old
and his show was on IRSSI Connectbot and this is something that you can get from Evdroid which will
allow you to connect to IRSSI which is a internet relay chat server around if you don't know we
hang out on irc on freenode.net in the channel hashugcastplanet and there you can talk to people
in the world you can even talk to me although I am eight hours out of sync with everybody else.
So what I tend to do is at the end of the day I take the logs from the previous day then listen
to them and then respond the following day so expect to 48 hour delay in replying. So
good show my own comments about that would be I would be reluctant to do this because I would not
like one of my keys unencrypted on my phone even if it is protected with a password I just do not
give me a warm fuzzy feeling but depends on the depends on the context I guess. The following day
the paranoid among us continue with the ahuka show from the privacy and security series and how
to set up a open SSH server. I taking the same approach he has to his liberal office series
have basically gone through this whole thing in small steps and basically showing you what to do
and how to set up a SSH server. Lots of links in there very very useful and that brings us to
the following day which was HBRO community news and last month I was out with a chronic backpan
would be a word to describe it and thankfully John and Dave stood up to the plate and did the show
for us and that's basically what HBRO is all about people from the community getting up and doing
what needs to be done and I appreciate it that they did that for us and it was also interesting
just to hear this show from the for the first time as having not participated and there was one
other show that I was not before but I was listening on mumble just not participating um so it's
it's actually yeah it's it's nice to hear that and there were very very very kind to everybody
what kind of than I am more strict and the next show was Swift 110 with SimCity build it September
2015 and um discussion about the this game and SimCity and what to do and how to how to go
up buildings use. I'm not particularly into games to be honest I lost quite a bit of my life on
on the Lemmings back in the day um but I do see the benefits of the kids are using Minecraft on the
Raspberry Pi's too and there's a coding element in there and I do see it as an interesting way to
get kids involved in coding so there you go but good show and there's more later on in the year
hold on I should be doing the comments for these shows as I go along let's see if there are any
comments you see if Dave isn't here or I look at him here I make a complete mess out of the whole
thing which is which is unfortunate I must say but so there haven't made any comments on the shows
we discussed so far I knew that all along I knew that all along then we had today with a tech
uh tit radio uh 21 I thought I had better links uh 5150 saving us all from actually needing to
do any work um I find it just easier to wait for a 51's uh links and just browse through them
rather than parsing through news feeds myself then the next day was our 10 year anniversary and
as look would happen have it on that day when it was released they uh there was actually 10 years
so we we nails that more out of accident than uh by planning but it was really really awesome
to talk to doobes and this was another weird one because I never have mumble um fall out of me
like that and then just five minutes in the whole thing disconnected and then reconnected again
you probably heard me coming in and out but again I was as I don't edit the shows you know um
it was only later that I I realized I was able to sit and enjoy uh droops
droops is one of those guys who got me into podcasting in the first place and I have the
absolute most respect from and so much so that you know what he's doing now with those kids
absolutely awesome and absolutely amazing and it was actually great to go back and hear uh
what was going on because I was the other side of the the world when this whole thing was started
I'm just contributing like anybody else so I had no involvement whatsoever in the in the initial
setup and really all I've been doing since since then is just doing these shows once a month and
replying to email posting the ad show now and again so uh droops um post a day silly comment
and then we had Jay while public school supervisor hearing about all your classes makes me a
little envious to be honest uh Dave Morris said I love this interview really enjoyed it
congratulations thanks Ken no need to thank me it was uh droops who took the time out it was a
droops who took the time out to start this you know let's not forget it's easy to to keep the momentum
going once it's been going for so long the these guys set the whole thing up in the first place
and notably whether it was going to take off or not so awesome then it was great to get an
understanding about more history of HPR HPR and given further insight into who the founders were
and their motive what the motivations was and droops sounds like a hell of a teacher couldn't
agree with you more and just to that vein I've been really really really really listening to this
episode on the train and I've been making note of the the people droops mentioned in that and
it's definitely uh my intention to go back and interview a lot more of these so we can get our actual
history going on in there and then uh have this in our above page again awesome awesome stuff
okay uh following day we had text formatting options are explored and this is the Libro Office
series and this month they are this one they were doing text styles and text formatting toolbar
and this clarified a lot of stuff for me and again look in the show notes with a link to
a hooker's own website where you've got screenshots on this so very good stuff there has always
very professional you know it's embarrassing that we have shows of this quality on here and we're
just passing them off every month has been yeah this is what we expect from a hooker who you know
if he submits anything or lesser quality than this we will all be we will all be annoyed
anyway Taraki did a show 15 motivated by the 15 x 15 excuses not to record a show for
HPR done by nightwise and he had a link in there discussed the my probe log as well manifest
which is a a project that he would like to get started basically looking for a using HPR as a
motivation to get back into uh developing that and i really hope he does because he submitted two
shows so seems to be on a roll here as the following day was recording a HPR episode on the fly
and the android phone um so they um he installed you record from android and um basically gives a
review of of the software so another option there if you have got an android phone no excuse to
not use that i actually use you record as well i found it very handy for taking minutes of meetings
and then you're just hands free for the rest be easy submitted to show the following day based
on what's in your bag and um usb encryption usb stick and a mouse and uh clips share europe buds which
i'd never heard of before 60 uh 80 dollars shipping and these are uh always always of interest to me
um and has very very handy tool in there to just go back to my previous comment about uh securing
your SSH keys on your android phone there is f allocate-l3gmyimage.img which will mount an encrypted
looks partitions so pretty cool pretty cool stuff the following day we had hacking a belt to make
it fit and uh this is this is a cool uh cool episode kind of makes sense the only uh thing is i
would probably be hacking it to add on more than uh hacking it to make it smaller but uh i i'm always
interested in um in these sort of things and this um hardware hacks or fixing stuff that's broken
it really really um gives me a sense of achievement um in the previous episode that was or in the
previous attempt to record this that wasn't recorded my daughter was describing how um the last
thing we fixed were was that these earphones where she was able to fix um one of them stopped working
where the coil had uh fallen off so she was able she unscrewed it put the coil back put it down
with the cello tape and was able to fix the headsets um the one that i'm using right now so
absolutely love uh this sort of thing and now that john has meted an official thing that hackers
are interested in then uh you never know or might actually do some more shows about that sort of
thing mostly we're very light on the comments this month um as well so uh lonely been three so far
the Arduino clatu was back with a Arduino bluetooth how-to and you will get the commenters out
for sure for sure and this is uh continuing what will be soon if it's not already a series on
Arduino um and this was the super uh he's not about super basic uh Arduino controller um or
controlling arduino's and getting the talk of her boob bluetooth and migray um says really good show
clatu really enjoyed anything about Arduino in general fitting with the tronics currently i'm
mucking about with an earth transmitter receiver modules that have and have considered using
Zigbee so this show was of of interest look forward to mic doing some shows on that
clarky years on the roll my road to linux and installing watchtower on the amiga as he reviews
22 years of linux usage and described basically everything are basically the road to linux and it
was pretty interesting to see all that stuff 22 years that's all that's allowed speaking with
somebody else who uh was uh talking about stuff to computer away from laptop the mobile
computing and stuff was chasar and using an Nvidia shield tablet with wifi with a case with a
bluetooth mouse with a keyboard with a power hub and then free and open source android apps so
there's kind of few here that i had known about quite a few and didn't know about one or two that
i installed after the fact and a few that i probably will come across if i ever need to the only
thing about this was i was just wondering why not use a netbook or something where just everything's
connected and you don't have all these little bits that would be very fugly for me on the train
i think for my personal use case but yeah maybe could come on test of why he didn't you know
what the advantages of this over laptop don't know if i was that was particularly clear
nightwise saying don't get locked in and to be honest when i heard this i was going to think it was
a a discussion about not getting locked into a proprietary software but actually it was about
not getting locked into your your beliefs just uh go with the flow and uh or you know use the
best tool for the job and i will say i don't agree with them uh because he's well able to take
the fact that people don't agree with him and i don't agree with him on the point of you that if
you don't use the software then if you don't use the software then it won't if you don't use open
source software you can't report the bugs you can't report the bugs they can't be improved that's
basically when it comes down to it so yes absolutely correct uh even the hookah said that things
like impress are not as good as PowerPoint but there will never be as good as PowerPoint if people
don't get involved and use them and improve them there you go that's my feeling but yes he does
have a point use the best tool for the job so i uh there is a certain thing called morals and ethics
and your personal beliefs do come into it so it's not i don't think it's just black and white
as all that so but a good show nonetheless hopefully this will inflame them so much that you will
come back and do more shows for us more back scripting tips while apparently Dave is a genius
of many many many things and i have as soon as i heard this show i went and updated many of my scripts
particularly the ones related to dates and log files they that is just saved saved my life so much
so this is going into my most have series as always and this this got the commenters out of the
out of the woodwork first comment was by frank thank you Dave very nice piece of work i've been
trying to understand regular expressions i guess because i like puzzles in addition to giving
me a better understanding of bash the examples you gave show similarity with some regular
expressions syntax which in turn gives some context regular expressions so that it does not seem
to be quite so far in a language Dave replied regular expressions subject is a complex one i've been
wondering whether i should try and pass on what i know about it uh Dave this man is the hpr admin
and still doesn't know that should i record a show for hpr by default means yes anyway
Dave yes there is nobody on the planet who works with linux does not want to understand regular
regular expressions better anyway strictly strictly this phrase expansion topic is in an area
of using patterns to match filenames confusingly this is similar but not the same as regular
expressions in the later episodes in this not series i want to talk more about file name matching
then look at regular expressions in the context bash really the regular expression subjects could
should yes should could be a standalone and should look at what's available in bash grip
said all et cetera use paro regular expressions the most but a hesitate to go too deep there because
they are mind blowing yes they are yes they are but we also need grip said and oak regular
expressions help in fact oak and said i have the feeling that my experience with them are just
mere toe in the water of the deep abyss that would be those um tools so if you are familiar with those
tools please don't assume that everybody is record a show on Saturday thank you very much
frank replied again indeed regular expressions are complex they make my brain hurt frank
i'm with you my friend i'm with you seeking some chemistry with shell commands some indication
that whoever precipitation regular expressions did not just make it up from a whole cloth is
something comforting i recently stumbled across a beginner's tutorial with a link digital ocean
community tutorials which i went to and there's actually very very good link in the show notes
what makes it so good is that it uses gpl key found on every Linux computer or the exercise gpl
text so you can practice examples and try different options as you read along so the the text that
you use in whoops is the gpl so that's pretty good so Dave says i skim through the tutorial and
looks very good thanks for the pointers so pretty cool is this thanks to recording i really hope so
okay the following day libra office multimedia and this is something that i have wanted to do uh
and i've struggled with i really have so much soul that i just didn't bother and went video
and then all's tab to an external player but hoca goes through and clarifies it and there i think
he makes makes very good points where you know the libra office is lacking in certain things then
moral volcano first time host excellent excellent show had i had i listened to this um does not like
the fact that gnome 2 went away i'm guessing but makes valip makes absolutely valip points and
earlier i was trying to explain it to my nine-year-old daughter and i met her the kin to you're
playing on the playground and somebody some of their children changed the game is that nice
yeah sometimes it is and if they'll do it and they don't tell you then is that nice
oh it's not so uh so that's kind of what went on here but i a good do a very good um links here in the
show notes as well and where you can get various different fonts as well so cool stuff more the only
thing i was thinking moral volcano when you're doing a show don't waste all your topics on one show
please record multiple shows guys okay the following day just me slammed my taste in coffee no
actually the vast majority of coffee drunk in Ireland is uh nescafe instant so yes to be honest
i don't think i could tell one brand of coffee from the other and as it turns out most uh
studies on wine connoisseurs can tell the difference between red and white wine if they're put into
two different bottles and i strongly suspect that probably people can tell the difference in coffee
but uh i found some coffee here i found the coffee in the Netherlands the the regular stuff
is very burnt to my liking so i found a nice uh eat the open coffee that's uh is in the supermarket
and that's the one i drink it's pretty cool but a view into coffee uh i'd like to know from the
other coffee connoisseurs on here because it's now a series are you all happy their coffee is an
official series on hpr soon we'll be making kitten series but yes if people will insist on
making coffee shows then uh go ahead uh please do so oh yes dice where passphrase from
john duert duert and i oddly enough i hadn't heard about this before and then afterwards i
kept seeing come up everywhere basically you have uh whole go of regular words from a dictionary
are assigned the number you toss six uh i'm so dice and uh the number that comes out is fine the
only thing i would suggest if you're doing this is um cleft cam synod lucky you're a walk i don't know
how easy those would be to remember but yeah okay fair enough and that that's as unmemorable to me
as uh has anything so what i tend to do with my passwords is um i have several different things
inside them and then i will have i will maintain in each of them that is always a um one thing in
that series this is all it was one thing in the next series always one thing in the next series
in the next series and one of the series might be i don't know um rivers it isn't but it could be
and uh the next series could be you know types of monkeys or something and then you do the lead
lead-speak thing enough but not like just the easy lead speak um start looking at the keyboard
and go yeah if i was to pause uh it was to make a t for example be a um chevron uh over the six
like the chinese hat um with a pipe that would be a t so every time we come across that make up your own
lead speak letters and then use that so then it's a it's a phrase that you it's a thing that you
remember uh and of course you know one of your series should be heavily involved in numbers i don't
know maybe you have a number and then you are you thinkful word and you convert that to the letters
to numbers or something i don't know so yes anyway whatever works for you but it's an
interesting approach and if it works for you then good um no for something completely different this
was a shadowy figure who wanted to know if it was okay to uh uh ask was it out there yes it was
out there and uh but we don't uh we don't as admins ever um check what the shows are so the shows
that are put up there are the shows we have no um we have no we do not edit in any way the shows
there's two ways for that one that's a traditional thing as in droops set it there on the
and the ten year anniversary um you know why should i or anybody else you don't pick say whether
it's a good show or not um so um there you go it was a very period piece and i'll say at the time
i don't know if um it would pass the code of conduct taking for certain people but it did make me
chuckle i must say um awesome that that's uh that that's a uh fifty one fifty shop are selling my
my earbuds with a not enough that's i'm patent pending on that one just so you all know i've got
a lot of intellectual property tied up in that particular idea so i will be chasing these people
um so the following day was a short walk with my son Dave who is you know you know i'm not
allowed to say you owe me a show anymore which is fine i'm happy with that unless of course
you say you're going to do a show in which case you owe me a show it's a personal thing is
nothing to do with hpr or the commitment or the gpl if you say can i'm going to send you a show
now i will go yes you owe me a show so oh as he went along he just kept digging himself into a
deeper and deeper hole Dave why did you do this now i have all these shows to you to uh keep track of
although these lapel mics look really really cool i was thinking oh seeing if i could get one
but by the time uh yeah bug Dave is course from the bugcast.org
uh we're all good music meets someone's it's crazy common a metric versus imperial measurements yes
that's uh he did that and uh met many promises of different shows to have so that was it for the
shows for this month and i missed some comments from GNU Linux or TM just listened while walking to
the dog and a cloudy spooky night before Halloween love the delivery working on working in all the
hpr references and is going to learn more about the me go pad t02 they almost say the production
quality on the on the shadowy figures theater performance was absolutely awesome i was funny
because when the rain started i was going hey i know already got that he got that at free sound
dot org cause uh cause i use that as white noise and work when i want to get so i want to go into
the zone and people are being loud so pretty cool that was that for the shows let's see mailing
list discussions um two main topics uh this month both of them concerned the community news so some
months there's a lot of chatter uh more months it's uh nice and quiet there was a few comments on
previous shows from um back in august and my bills multimeter mods part one i got a comment by
nether geek nianner geek like that like that handle yes just got my uh unity ut61e and still waiting on
my usb cable i may get a lead backlight added tomorrow i'll follow up when i do one of one of the
photos had what looks like a story organizer for resistors in the form of one quarter of a circle
do groups of four of them make stackable rings are they affordable and are they useful and my bill
we tune in next month to find out what my bill says about that in the uh september episode frank
bell did an episode on introduction to w3m command line web browser there were two comments
comment number one was from tom underscore len hi i just discovered this tool
w3m and i was wondering if it would be possible to access to a page that requires a login and password
i need to be able to do an automatically from the command line i couldn't be pressing keys it's
a headless server do you know if that's possible i would need to grab some text but once i logged in
the url remains the same so he gives the uh the url according to the man page you can
automatically log in with a proxy perhaps you could bend you will see the poth argument in the
man page i'm skeptical that's what you want to do now i will reply back to tom underscore len now
saying that this is absolutely possible using uh wget and it's absolutely possible using uh
curl on a headless server not a problem um but that will save it out to a file and i don't know if
that's if you want to do an interact i'm not 100% sure you want to do an interactive session here
but then again you're saying that's a headless server so it seems to be that you want to script it
but you can definitely do that which uh curl with wget and in both of them in curl especially you
can change they use a rage and string if there's anything funky funky stuff going on there
in curl you can also do uh pushes as well as gets and you can do um i guess um you can even do
connections over ssl and stuff like that so that's pretty that's probably the way you want to go
in response to gabriel even fires a mouse in amaze on the raspberry pi the comment number two
was eric with a better mouse and here's my code for creating amaze and excel it's actually fairly
easy to make a true maze without any block to sections basically it grows out of walls from the edges
as long as you don't connect with other walls you'll end up with a graph where every space can be
visited from every other space uh acumenet doesn't seem to uh like me posting code so just describe
the acronym if you could email that eric place to um admin at hbur i'd like to see what you're
doing um basically he says you create a square of rules from x without numbers you put a w and
you tell i'm not going to describe that uh because it's a show on itself gosh hold on
perhaps eric you could record a show on this and then in the show notes you could upload the excel
document describing that that would be also is comment goes on very much to describe everything
and gabriel replies that's an interesting algorithm i can intuitively see why it works but i want
to think of how i could prove it one would put a start an end point in the maze in that case
it transfers algorithm through the maze generated like that would probably just be a right hand
rule variant since the wall would be a single connected component the truly random generation that
i mentioned in the podcast does not guarantee that of course meaning the right hand rule would just
lead the mouse in a circle forever actually if you if you want to uh can you go and please read
this or uh gabriel can you record a comment back to this general rule of thumb if your comments
starts hitting an essay then can you record a show especially if davis and here to read all the
stuff out from ham so i was going to two isper into mind it always make that cheese are scandames
and mark connected components ensure the mouse and the cheese land on the same connected component
scandames mark the connected components and make a pair of independent connection components
brick walls between them and connect on time the maze gets a single component connection your
generation or approach produces much more sanitary generally pleasing looking maze i'm looking
to see if there's a good way then to take it and shake it up a little to allow for disconnected
world segments and such a while remains while and such while retaining such pleasingness of course
there's another possibility to add the notion of teleporters to the maze as my face thanks for the
insight on the algorithm that's what i like best about my little exercises there's so many variations
you can make a lot of stuff for each of them in response to the awesome epic guide to kiddie
and get his replied to a comment from me saying thanks can glad to know that you found the article
useful and agree with the work while i'll be looking around for follow up and see if we can find
another one absolutely cool that's where he took the mimics format and read out an article
uh not just read out read it out with with feeling and there he also posted a reply back to
John Colp who had previously said really enjoyed the episode um wants to thank you and Dave for
the encouraging feedback from last month's community news episode i'm pleased that you both agree
with being a good idea and to read creative comments articles i'd like to i'll take that as
approval from the HPR community as i said before you don't need approval from the HPR community
you just do it i'll even take requests if anyone finds something of interest that i can go
virtual audio licensing permitting as you rightly pointed out hope it's not too long before i can
post another show whether it's a regional content or not no definitely if it's creative comments
and the license allows it and now go for it personally i don't think i could do that because as you
can tell i'm struggling just to read out comments here uh whereas um whereas you seem to be able to
read an article and make it like your uh just having a conversation in the pub which is an awesome
gift um Dave Morris's episode and this here is a raspberry pie that will very soon be over there
at my printer because this network printer that i spent over the odds to buy the network printing
function has actually stopped so i'm printing now through my wife's PC so it means that in order to
print i need to go through my wife's PC so i'm going to i'm having a raspberry pie on the inside of
the network to connect to the raspberry pie in the intranet which i connect to the stepping
stone server which i've been connected to from various different places yes i am paranoid but
Dave and then as i was listening to Dave's episode about this i was also down in the recycling
shop in the kringle winkels uh thanks junkled for that tip and i was looking at perfectly good printers
there that are not network attached anymore i was thinking hey if i had done a little bit of
research or just got lucky there are printers down there for a tenor uh probably don't have any
cartridges and then refer to my continuous in supply system printer find a good printer there
make sure it works with continuous in supply system slap on a raspberry pie that you have
anyway next to it with a usb connector bob johnkel mech johant and tom's your first cousin
yes indeedy anyway back to the comments for the episodes because i'm 100% sure you have no
interest in me listening to this so um we had a whoa remote scanning comment previously from
john kulp and at the time i was thinking i think he was thinking why would you ever do that
and since then i've been thinking yes we'll give you a lot more control than the printer itself
if i can control it remotely with a scanner because i do have a sheet feeder on this thing and then
would allow me to take it the problem with it is the sheet feeder thing has a it works and then
i have to it saves it to a particular file format and there's no control you basically don't
have any controllers just dumped on a on a network location whereas if i'm scanning that in using
a piece using a linux machine i can then set up our toolchain where i can scan and then do a
worc perhaps on at least put file names in that our mean something to me anyway back to the comments
meanwhile back to the comments dead morris remote scanning exception thanks john i like that
rousers can turn can run printers like this boss suspect the features are limited and john was on
about getting a rouser that he got in a in the good will shop back to davis comments i have plans
to experiment with kulp's perhaps configuring other cues for a different size stationary for
example i also have a very old deck ln03 monochrome laser printer circa 1987 which i'd like to
hook up if it still works it needs a serial connection which should be fun the scanning capability
is good to have and has been used more than i would have expected quality is not particularly high
but it's good enough for most purposes then we had a comment by turtle nice show here is the kulp's
ppd for the deck ln03 just proves that people are subscribed to the hpr feed as well yolts has the
manual and only need is a usb to serial adapter looking forward to hearing about getting it running
and putting that on the pie and other printer cheers turtle dav morris replied deck ln03 thanks
turtle i had not got as far as checking drivers and manuals very useful from my initial researches
this is with anything with dav you just dangle some tech in front of him and he's gone
anyway and i will not have other people use dav in such a manner that i use him on hpr
from an initial resource back to the comments from an initial researches i was sure i wasn't sure
whether a serial adapter could drive the printer i didn't know if it needs flow control for
example however i should continue to investigate i also have a hundred and thirty two column matrix
printer somewhere in the attic but i think it has a centralics parallel connector wow that
takes me back so i suspect that there will be a challenge to get that work in bob evans
replies connecting to legacy printers hi day thanks for this timely episode i'm considering a pie
to serve my hp laser jet 2200 printer on my home network the deck nln03 uses rs232 rs422 for
a serial connection you should be able to use usp to serial converter i used an ln03 with pc
clones and i was able to run a serial link as fast as 19 200 bold user manual wind case how to set
serial parameters via dip switches near the data connector excellent i suggest verifying the
print engine still works by printing a few test page before trying to connect to a computer i
think there is a small square white button on the back that indicates printing of a test page
it is probably difficult now to get toner or replacement parts like feed rollers for the ln03
when the nln gears inside my ln03 fractured i finally ditched the printers after about 20
years of use in the home office columns there would it now not be possible to print off a replacement
part on a 3d printer perhaps be an interesting topic for somebody anyway be aware that there are
a few different ln03 models mine was the rare image printer that would only accept
post crypt the model will determine the driver and the settings that need to be used the ln03
always keeps the fuse a unit hot this is a big hour consumer and harsh on the mechanics that
transport paper and the photosensitive band there used to be a usp to parallel converter available
if you can find one of those you might be able to easily connect to a matrix printer bob dav
replies thanks for the information bob i haven't checked the ln03 works yet it might not
sense it sold i'm pleased to hear there's a good chance of running it from the pie though
if it does though the university i worked with both the pair of ln03s with a wax cluster in 1987
and i had a job of setting them up back when then under vms i'm pretty sure neither of them
were image printers we later brought a lps 17 i think with a lps 32 much faster higher volume
printers with duplexers i didn't offer to take them home when they were phased up though i might
have some supplies for the printer but not much of anything so might be a sure lived experiment
even if it does still print i need to check out the printer matrix the matrix printer as well
though i don't really have a use for it anymore and only one box of line printers by the way people
before you throw anything away don't throw the way always check with computer museums and
other places i don't know actually where other places would be if you have ideas of other places
before you throw out stuff just check and see if somebody else might be interested in
having it as i said those older pieces of kit are probably getting quite
fair fairly difficult to come in contact with now kuvno had a comment which i missed
actually you know it was an awkward talk with two young computer users and this was
hosted by kuvno himself how with his children and response to frank we said it was absolutely delightful
combiner agreed and said yes it's not awkward it's just as natural as a podcast can be
and rehabilitation keep it up someone in the euros is waiting for more stuff like this
wow there you go laugh yes library makerspace by john cult there was one comment by
someone called 3d print great program thanks uh lookspot is open harder the other one
i think not stl files as far as i know are not edible edible for binaries problem of
open washing in websites original CAD not available use free CAD to do more magnets use a tight
tolerance to go in but use a large chamber inside magnets use a tight tolerance to go in but
use a large chamber inside oh yes yes i think he's talking about the the modifications
forward the stand perhaps one comment on uh ahuka's home ssh server which i apparently skipped it
over um by kady marie ssh passers just quick clarification on a point made just after the 14
minute mark with regard to remote logging to an ssh server from the internet who can make
the comment you're transmitting the password in the clear according to the ssh man page all communications
between client server including password verification are done using public key encryption which is
correct finally and this is in quotes finally if other authentication methods fail ssh prompts the
user for a password the password is sent to the remote host for checking however since all
communications are encrypted the password cannot be seen by anyone listening on the network
and in court when using open and possibly hostile metrics something to keep in mind is to watch
for the warnings for server-sector get fingerprints as changed this comes up for a server you use
regularly be very very suspicious he loves hearing about security stuff so keep it going smiley face
yeah got a lot of points there and that's pretty much it for for today i think um sorry uhuka
could enjoy us and also sorry that my uh little helper i wasn't able to um yeah filled recordings
happen all the time we're afraid folks that's that's just it i don't have anything else to say at
this point in time there wasn't a lot on the on the mailing list other than to say the four
doors of our camp they um it's been a while since i've been in the uk to our camp and they
tabled a lot that we have over there it's absolutely covered in signatures of people who have contributed
shows to hpur this is uh really really cool thing so if you want to be one of those people who
whether it's on the uh in the us or in the uk or here in europe comes across a hpur table uh you
will be able to sign your name on that table by simply recording a show for a heck of a degree
hot more motivation do you need so also please consider if you're not involved in hgur of no
desire to record a show see if you can get more people to record shows i'm particularly interested in
other types of voices that you might not hear on hpur as much so read into that whatever you mean
whatever you like but the more the merrier that is what we need okay and tune in tomorrow for another
