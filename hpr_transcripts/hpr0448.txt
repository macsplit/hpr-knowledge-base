Come celebrate 40 years of UNIX at the Ohio Linux Fest from September 25th through
the 27th.
If you use GNU Linux, BSD, Open Solaris, or any UNIX or UNIX-like system, you belong
at Ohio Linux Fest.
Register free today at OhioLenix.org.
We are listening to Hacker Public Radio.
It's September 5th, 2009, and once again, it's time for TIT Radio.
Hello, I'm Monster B, and this is episode 8, and at the round table, will the TIT round
table with me tonight is Asmeth.
Oh, good evening.
Cla too.
Hello everyone.
Art V61.
Good evening.
J-Man 83.
Hello.
Peter 64.
Good eye.
The Zokes.
Hey.
Hello.
And Pegwall.
Hey.
I'm glad you didn't call me Peggy this time.
I was getting ready too.
I noticed.
Let me start off with some feedback.
This one here is from Tom Monks.
He's been listening to Linux Crank since the first episode, and he's really been enjoying
the new TIT radio format.
He says, I have to say, my favorite crank moment is still the one about the savory biscuits.
I was doing some work.
I still don't get that one.
What?
I don't either.
You said he was doing some work on the house.
And you said he was laughing so hard, he almost fell off the ladder.
I would like to actually apologize to him for every episode I've been on, and I would
like to apologize and gas.
You'll get that apology one day.
And you guys want to hear about this live CD I'm using?
Yeah.
I'm doing this show right now with the live CD.
It's called Jibby.
Is that a new cool Linux live CD?
No, it's a new cool NetBSD live CD.
NetBSD?
Yeah.
It's firstly built from NetBSD 5.01.
Can you run this off of the USB stick as well, or is it just a live CD?
Oh, you probably could.
What's that program you can use to convert it?
You have to.
You have to.
Yeah, you probably could.
I tried PC anywhere, no, BSD anywhere, sorry.
And I tried to make a USB stick out of it, and then I read the documentation when it didn't
work, and it says, yeah, you can't do that.
So I was wondering if I was talking about it being BSD and having a different, you know,
and its sequence or what?
Can you install that one you're talking about, BSD anywhere, or is it strictly a live CD?
It is strictly a live CD.
I tried putting it on a stick, on an SSD card, basically the same, you know, same result.
I guess I could have tried some kind of DD thing, you know, and just like literally copy
it over to an SD card or something, but I didn't think that would work.
I could try it.
Yeah, this one here seems kind of aimed toward experts who, you know, need like a rescue
disk, or it's probably good for nubes that just weren't like a working Unix distro just
to play around with.
You can install this one either yet, strictly just a live CD.
What do you have running on a desktop, I presume?
Yeah, I'm just running a live CD right now, on that same box that I have free BSD on.
It all has all Intel parts, and I tried it on an AMD 64 system, also, and I mean everything
works, and it's fast.
It's got the XFCE desktop.
And when you first boot the thing, it puts you right at the shell prompt, using corn
shell, and you have to type in start X to boot up the desktop, or, you know, fire it
up, fire up X, but it, I mean, it's really snappy.
The only thing I notice, okay, on the AMD system, everything just works, but on this Intel
system, I don't know if it's because of the graphics driver, but terminal won't start
up.
I have to use X term.
I don't know why or what's causing it, but...
Why terminal is the trying to use...
How did it, did a fault one in XFCE?
Okay, that is weird.
Yeah, it is.
That sounds vaguely familiar, though.
I don't think it was with XFCE, but I remember some terminal not starting on some BSD system,
I think it was.
I could be wrong about this, but it sounds very familiar.
It might have been in XFCE on Linux, maybe some library didn't get installed or something.
But it's really snappy, it comes with everything you need, I mean, for a live CD.
How's the package manager in that?
Uh, choosing the package source.
Okay.
But I haven't installed anything, you know, on the live CD.
Right, yeah, that would make sense, I guess.
But I'm...
About the expand line, it seems the package manager is a little gooey with it, or...
Well, it's a support system, just like, it's very similar to...
Just like...
It's not for BSD.
Yeah, it's very similar.
But I'm running it right now for the chat room and, uh, talks to you.
So...
Cool.
And it's been running...
Let me do an uptime right now, because I fired it up earlier today and it's been running
for a while.
Let me just see what the...
It's been running for 4.5?
4.5 on it.
No, it doesn't.
I mean, let me do a U name.
Yes, yes.
How is the hardware support, then, so you haven't noticed anything, uh, not working on
just basically a boot from the live CD, or you're having any issues.
No issues at all.
I mean, but I'm using on a desktop.
I haven't tried it on a laptop yet.
I just have weird issues with that, uh, Intel HDA sound driver, whatever it is, I don't
know.
I forget, on which systems, but just random ones that I'll try will not have sound support
until I really go to extreme measures to get this Intel underscore HDA, underscore
driver, or something like that, or reconfigured.
On just on the BSDs?
No, no.
It was BSD, Solaris.
I want to say the PowerPC version of either Devian or Fedora, I don't remember.
No, it wasn't PowerPC.
That's a different issue.
Yeah.
It was BSD and it's Open Solaris.
Yeah, this one works just fine.
Okay.
Cool.
I'll have to try this out.
Kind of nice that the BSDs are starting to get into the live, uh, speedy thing.
Seems like they weren't really doing that for, like, better, or maybe I should never
hurt them.
Yeah, and this one, Future plans to have a, uh, installer, which would be nice.
That'd be pretty cool, yeah.
Because this is 100% that BSD.
Yeah.
Let me pull up real quick to this link.
I can find it.
There's also another one called Wi-Fi BSD or BSD Wi-Fi.
It's a live CD with all kinds of, uh, Wi-Fi drivers.
That sounds really cool.
I mean, that sounds like something one could potentially obviously run on a laptop.
That'd be kind of neat.
I wish they would do the whole live USB thing, though, or maybe I should try with that.
You can get booting again to see if it works.
Well, I'll throw that link in the show notes if I can find it.
Are you basically loading the whole thing into RAM and then just running it, you basically
off your system RAM?
Yeah, that's what it's doing now.
Because I have free BSD installed on the hard drive.
Right.
And I just threw this on here just to play around with it.
But, sir, it's pretty quick right now because it's all, it's all just stashed in your,
like, eight gigs of RAM or whatever you've got.
Well, in this machine, it's got two gigs.
And it shows, it's using 400 megabytes right now.
That's what Firefox open with 10 tabs.
Yeah.
And I have two X terms running.
It's not doing too bad.
It seems smooth.
Cool.
Um, this fan is too loud, isn't it?
The box man, I have a running.
Ah, head wall.
Yes.
Something kind of tacky.
Yes.
Well, it has the tagline, the polyster of all cast because it is.
It'll be turned off and then I'm done smoking.
It just keeps getting tackier.
Yes.
All right.
I'm done talking.
What do you got for us, Claudio?
I have a really cool little application that DeepGeek can actually email me about asking
if I knew of a command line way to examine, like, video and audio files and things like that.
And it turns out that there is a pearl script called Exist tool, EXIF tool.
And it'll be called something different in each distribution.
If you just go, if you've got software and you're doing it from, like, the FBOPKG, I think
it's just Exist tool.
If you're doing it off the door, it's like, Exist tool, dash, image, dash, pearl.
And it's something different on Debian.
I forget what.
So it'll be a little bit different, but the idea is the same.
The program is the same.
And you can simply, in a command line, type in Exist tool, EXIFTOL.
And then the name of whatever video file or audio file you need to analyze.
And it will read.
It's only reading the metadata, so if someone, you know, for some reason, got the metadata wrong
or is spoofing the metadata, then I guess you're going to be getting false information.
But assuming you're just trying to find out what, you know, what a mysterious video file is or whatever,
then all you need to do is type in Exist tool, that file name.
And it gives you everything you could ever want to know about that file.
It's really nice.
It's really handy.
If you don't have, you know, if you're doing stuff and you don't have EXIFT started,
and you can't get into VLC to analyze the streams and everything, this is a really cool tool for that.
Does it have a website?
No, it does.
It doesn't make any, it's not like they didn't go to the trouble of getting like a site, you know, as such.
But it is on the interweb somewhere.
Here it is.
It's www., you know what?
Let me just paste this in the IRC, because it's just, I think it must be some guy's like academic email or something, you know.
It's just kind of somewhere.
Like I said, I found it pretty much like we had it in FBO, PKG, Fedora Havett, and Debbie and Havett in the repositories.
I could just find the chat room that I want to paste this into.
Here it is.
No, SNO.phy.pleanfu.ca slash tilde fill slash EXIFT tool.
I was spelling it wrong.
I wonder I can find it.
Yeah.
I wasn't putting the E at the beginning.
Ah, sorry.
Yeah.
EXIF.
I mean, I honestly don't use it that much, because typically if I'm doing work on video stuff, I've got X started, you know.
But there are those odd occasions where you need to just find out what format someone sent you, a bunch of files in.
And rather than having to start X just to play this thing in VLC or in player, you know, read what it's giving you in its output.
EXIFT tool helps a lot.
And I mean, it doesn't care what file it is.
I mean, it'll just read the metadata on pictures, you know, like on photographs, on music files, on video files, whatever.
And it gives you all kinds of information, the MIME type, the file type, the codec being used, the container that it's put into,
whether it's joint stereo or mono or stereo, what sample rate, the bit rate, everything you can imagine, really.
I mean, you know, anything that's the metadata of that file, it's back up to you.
And this is end curses, or is it got like a...
No, it just parses it and it's it out into your terminal in two columns.
You know, on the left it tells you what it's telling you, and then on the right it tells you the value.
You could obviously pipe it to a text document or something if you needed it for your records or something like that.
Typically I just piped it to left, look at it really quick, and then I've got whatever I need.
Which is usually what codec is really being used or maybe what sample rate, you know, something like that.
So Cloud2, when I wanted to know stuff like that on video, have you ever used that TC Prove?
I think it comes with M-Fail or MIME code or whatever, this does exactly the same thing I take it,
but you can use it on what everything, right, you see, features and everything.
So this is going to tell me what this tells you the resolution, the movie's done in, what audio and video cadets, all that sort of information.
Yeah.
Oh, that's pretty easy.
But I wonder what your program is reading, because this one only reads metadata, which is one reason I don't really use it that much.
I prefer just because I don't want there to be a risk of forgetting false information.
I prefer to use DLC because from what I can tell that's reading it from the actual stream, you know.
What's the name of the thing that you're talking about?
The TC Prove, it might be part of the Transcode package.
Okay.
Yeah, it's where I use a lot on video.
When I find, you know, a video that looks pretty good, and I want to know how they've done it.
I just run this TC Prove and dash-eye for the input file and obviously the file name.
Yeah.
You can tell a lot of useful data.
I'm not sure if it's part of...
Yeah.
It looks like...
Yeah.
It's called Transcode.
I think Transcode, yeah.
Could you put that command in the chat room?
What is the TC Prove?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dash-eye.
Oh, when it looks dash-eye for the...
It's one of...
I've used it for ease.
And now does this work without X being launched?
So it doesn't need to see the video's playing, right?
No, I'm pretty sure you can just...
Yeah, do it from the command line at X.
But in saying that, I don't know if it's all about drawing and that way, plus two.
It's like I say, not something I actually need a whole lot.
But when I do, you know, it's just such a pain sometimes to have to launch X.
If you're not...
You know, if you're just working on something and you don't want to bother with it,
that's the one reason I use XF tool.
But I'm going to look into the TC Prove.
I didn't know about that one.
Glad you mentioned it.
Yeah, I don't have a lot to do with Friday.
It's really fun to play around with this one.
You just mentioned it.
Yeah, well, I mean, that's a good point.
I mean, I use it on photos as well.
I mean, I know that there's probably a way with image magic or something to figure out the size of a photograph.
But I don't know what it is.
And there are so many commands in image magic that I can't be bothered to try to figure.
You know, out the one that I want.
So, again, XF tool, just to find out that kind of information on a photo.
Yeah, that's great.
Use that a lot.
All right.
Pretty cool find.
Anything else?
No, not for me.
Because I'm kind of excited about this next one.
Hannah Montana.
Yeah.
I've had a death shot.
She's known there for a bit of time now that doesn't really get used because my wife,
she spends all the time on the laptop.
And as a few people know, I haven't heard of daughter.
Well, she turned out just the other day.
So I thought, well, what can I put on here that might get her a little bit more enthusiast with lineage?
Although, in saying that, she's not too bad.
She has the little OUBC.
And I've heard about Hannah Montana's lineage.
And as anyone who has a daughter about her age knows, Hannah Montana is just hit at the moment.
And I'd also heard it's a Tom and Larry on the...
What's going on here?
Going along.
Yeah, they had talked about it and actually called it evil.
Because in the song, it does say something about what RM, Dash, R, whatever, you know, racial hard drive.
But like, when I looked at that, I didn't think that was that big a deal.
Anyway, I can't see my daughter ever actually looking at the words to this song.
So anyway, I put Hannah Montana on.
Now, virtually all that is...
And this is the only thing I couldn't understand is it really is just John T. Jackalope,
a Ubuntu with a Hannah Montana thing.
So I was a little bit disappointed that I went to the trouble to download the whole distribution.
And I wanted to find out that really, it's just from the boot up, the grab menu right through the splash screen to your desktop,
you're going to get glorious peak of purple.
I'm not sure what color it's supposed to be.
It's only vibrant.
Sorry.
What a beautiful feature.
Fischer.
Fischer, okay.
We'll stick with Fischer.
I'd also read that you were going to get a few way files.
And I was really disappointed to find out that I just got the normal KDE start script
and had to go and make up a few way files for, you know, Hannah.
Like it sings Hannah Montana songs when it boots up now.
But anyway, the fact of the matter is it did what I was hoping.
My daughter was very enthusiastic about it all, jumped on it.
The other thing I was disappointed in that it really doesn't have any...
It's obviously aimed at young ladies.
No, more of your own.
Young boys, I don't know.
There's a few young boys said it wasn't true.
But I think if they went the same as troubled, they met this well.
Maybe they should have, you know, installed a few applications that the young girl might like.
I mean, this play he said that he developed that, you know, to get young ladies interested in Linux.
It should have went a little bit more trouble, I think, and installed some applications.
The first one, of course, I put on there was that J2E that we talked about on Linux.
Thanks.
Because my daughter loves that.
I would imagine any little girl is going to love that application.
So, if you do have a spare computer or a young lady that you want to get interested in Linux,
I think you could do a hell of what was the Panamontan Linux.
So you're going to forget with all your modifications?
Well, from everything I read about too, that it was supposed to loop the Panamontan songs when they booted up.
But I couldn't find any way of it all or anything.
Of course, a really music file suggested that there was a Panamontanath link to the audio.
It's because you're too old to operate it, Peter.
Yeah, probably.
But definitely only had the Ubuntu boot up noise when it played it.
It's not too bad.
Of course, I installed OpenMolar on it.
Because I wanted to be the first wake to install OpenMolar on Panamontan Linux.
And I think I do some screenshots.
I want to hear more about their song.
The song?
Is it the song they made just for this distro or is it a real song?
No, the song is just her scene.
And she does that?
She does are in that scene.
Oh, no, sorry, in the song.
Oh, yeah, that's what you're talking about.
No, I think the bloke wrote that song.
Hello, I had the words to you.
I can see it for you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear it.
Oh, yeah, boot up.
Yeah, you get the gooey out front.
Yeah.
Out of stars, every theme, every color.
Yeah.
I don't know what, but you suppose to sing too.
That's obvious, Peter.
Your roots can be kind of fun.
Okay, yeah, as well as your password is never discovered.
Okay, that's fair enough.
Now, this is the line I think that Tom or Larry had trouble with.
But text reports call because nobody knows.
Here you get to be a Windows loser.
But big time when you RM-RF Wildcard, you get the best of both OSs.
Run Windows, take it slow.
I mean, hi.
Who cares?
Oh, I love that song.
Yeah.
How does that song get?
I'm trying to think of a song if I knew the tune I could sing.
It's so much better.
Oh, yeah.
I'm glad we got that recorded.
Yeah.
Why should I get my daughter in it to sing?
Yeah, I'm surprised Peter just didn't put it for the tune of setting on my John Deere.
To read my hair, John Latter.
But that's the other thing.
Yeah, you're obviously not going to give your eight-year-old daughter the root password.
Like, there's no need for her to know it.
Even if she sang songs and typed the whole theme.
But I don't think there's going to be much damage.
So it's highly recommended, uh, little girls and little boys.
Take one.
How hardy are hard.
Does anybody read, uh, planet.dom.org?
No, I don't.
Okay.
The third story down was posted on what's today.
Today is the fifth, right?
So this is, uh, yeah, this was posted today.
Yes.
Now, is this a developer?
Who are you talking to?
Anybody wants to answer?
From GoTV to Danielle.
Yes.
Is this for real?
This is for real.
Oh.
Where are you?
I'm sorry.
Go to planet.dom.org.
Go to planet.dom.org.
Yes.
It's probably a developer.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Because he went to Gwadak, he says.
She says.
And he's going to be a woman.
And he comes back from vacation.
Correct.
Got it.
I think I'm going to get it this time.
What are you talking about?
This sounds like one advanced.
No, it's the official GNOME site.
Yes, for real.
It's the official GNOME site.
This is it.
Okay.
Mono, now, trainees.
What's next?
This is why you should use KDE right here.
You know, I mean, if you want...
I'm on panel 10.
He wants to become a girl.
It's his prerogative.
Yeah.
He's doing on planet.
Not GNOME.
But, I mean, people's personal posts get onto the planet because they...
They want it to be on there.
Come on.
Yeah.
I mean...
We each of us have them to talk about the 20-year-olds and look in the mirror.
Huh?
Come on.
Oh, friends.
Oh, friends.
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, that's all right.
I'm glad you're on that.
I'm glad you're on that.
I'm glad you're on Australia, Peter.
And that's where this guy is at.
Or Daniel, whatever his name is.
He's a Melbourne.
Is that it?
Oh.
That's what you're looking at, right?
Yeah.
Well, he has one way for me, huh?
He talks about being in touch before he moves to Melbourne.
Well, definitely Australia.
Where the hell are you straight?
I don't think I want to write this anyway.
I'm putting this in the show notes.
Something about a neighbor, Peter, right?
Well, yeah.
I see in the scene.
Four of them.
Five seats on them, which is a Pokemon.
If you use mono, you'll be able to write it.
It's not transvestite.
It's transsexual.
It's gendered.
It's gendered, whatever.
What does that mean?
It's confused.
That means confused.
Well, this is all very interesting, but I must say I'm wondering what way to talk about this
on here.
I don't know.
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, yeah.
I'm doing good.
I forgot to tell you about Google outweigh.
Yeah, honestly.
You know what?
I'm just trying to prove a point that Katie eats better.
Sorry.
I'm reading some of the comments.
Better than it was.
You're married.
What's your wife think?
Maybe she said, I think I need to start seeing other people.
And you thought, I could become another person.
I just wanted to make everyone aware.
Oh.
I'm uncomfortable.
One of you is seated.
Oh, sounds like everyone's all for it.
Okay.
Let's move on.
I mean, it doesn't really matter.
I mean, if she is contributing to Linux and doing cool stuff, then great.
Now, I don't really know what this person does, you know, so I can't really even comment on it.
I'm not making fun of her or him.
I'm just saying, you go, girl.
That's all I'm saying.
All right.
Peter's brought up Google OAS.
Okay.
If you guys were on the marketing team, how would you market Google OAS to kill Microsoft?
I wouldn't.
I would market something else, like Linux.
Well, the question I thought about, I think real Linux.
You're right that, um, wants to be, was, why do they have to?
Like, Google gets its revenue from advertisements on the web page.
Correct?
So really, what does it matter to them what OAS, um, it's running on?
Because that's the nature of businesses.
They always want to expand into every possible, um, you know, market or whatever.
I mean, isn't that just how it goes?
I mean, you would have said the same thing about, I don't know, Apple.
You know, why do they care about cell phones?
Because it's just more money.
If they get their products, if people are buying their products, then that's more money for them.
Yeah, and, yeah, well, that's where I was going to lead to about food.
That they're not going to make their money from there like OAS.
Right.
But if they started to release products like netbooks and their phones and desktop computers,
I take it to this Google Chrome, it's going to be a free operating system.
But the next logical step to me is to start to sell the hardware.
And they could sell it pretty cheap, I reckon.
Like, how much money do they have to make on a netbook that's going to run their operating system
with all their apps in the cloud that is then going to continue to generate revenue for them?
Is that where Dell is going?
Isn't that where Dell is headed with these phones?
But, well, I'm not sure how Dell can continue to make money after they give away or sell their hardware
with an operating system if that's what Dell's doing.
But Google would continue to make money purely through advertising on their OAS that they've given away
on the hardware that they've sold extremely cheap.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, well, I think you're right.
I think that's what they're doing.
I mean, I don't know if it's technically vendor lock-ins because they're not really locking people into anything.
But I mean, that kind of that sensibility.
It's like, everything you run needs to be Google.
You know, we'll brand some hardware and call it Google.
We'll get brand DOS and call it Google.
And then you'll start using all of our little apps.
You know, just kind of get people entrenched in all of your, in everything you offer.
What?
And then you have to get money from everything possible that you can.
Yeah, and hit the thought.
I see about that.
I mean, they want everyone to use all the Google stuff everywhere, sign up for all of that.
Why not give, or give either a discount or the hardware away for free?
We'll give you a free computer.
And you have to sign something saying that you know, you have to use all Google stuff.
No saying that's a good idea, but it's one, you know, people love free stuff.
Yeah, you know, I mean, actually people now that you say that, people were talking about the same thing when Apple was doing Apple TV.
Because it was, I mean, Apple TV is basically just a front-end for their iTunes store, you know.
So like, why not give it away and say, now go forth and buy all of your media from iTunes store.
But obviously they didn't do that.
I guess in Apple terms maybe they did sell it for a lot cheaper than they usually sell hardware for maybe.
So yeah, I mean, that would be a good idea if we were on Google's marketing team.
Give it away practically for free or whatever.
That's what I reckon.
Make, give it the hardware away at cost.
But the other thing too, and I don't know if I haven't read it anywhere,
sure Google, so is, is going to run the Linux kernel.
But do we know that you can install any software run?
Can I go and even put open office on this operating system?
What happens when this thing comes out and it's only got all Google applications?
But you can't put pay office on it.
You can't put open office on it.
You have to only use Google Apps.
How do we know?
Has anyone even seen that you can install different applications on this thing yet?
No, I don't think so.
We know it's probably going to be possible.
It might not be through some kind of elaborate hack or something,
but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't make it terribly effective to that.
Yeah, that's right.
Because they have to protect their impression.
They want everyone to sit down in front of a Google branded OS
and get the same kind of experience.
So if you sit down in front of my Google OS and it's hacked a bit and has chaos
instead of Google Docs, then that's not going to reflect good on their brand.
That's typically how companies, software companies, think about things.
Yeah, and also the fact that Google isn't targeting me or you or anyone on this call.
Right.
They go after, and like once we said, how they market it,
well, they get a market at the new user, aren't they?
They're going to try...
Logically, everything suggests to me that they have to sell this on...
have it on hardware.
Because me and you aren't going to go and install this on your computers.
New users aren't going to install it because they don't know how.
And that's the sort of people they are going to target.
I reckon they have to put it on hardware themselves.
And then those people who go and get it, the mums and dads or the ex-windows users
who really don't know that they're getting another operating system.
All they want to do is get on the internet.
You know, that's true.
They're going to be after.
No, it's not going to want us.
It's for life and office really.
Yeah, not sure you're right about that.
I'm sure you're right about that.
They can't sell it without the hardware.
Because people aren't going to install anything.
I don't care how easy the installer is.
It's just not going to happen.
No.
And the fact that no one else does.
Yeah, that's right.
And geeks aren't going to be interested.
Geeks are going to put this on.
Look at it, like me, with Hannah Montana Linux.
Five with it for 15 minutes.
And even that time.
What was it?
Green OS or GOS OS?
Yeah, I mean.
Yeah.
Everyone looks at all our geeks.
Look at these things.
But we certainly don't use them.
I think like a Windows Power user might install it.
You know, they might go to the website.
You know, the search for something they might say underneath.
You know, download our free operating system.
You know, it's virus-free.
That's true.
That's true.
You're probably right.
You could market it to the Windows Power user.
And I bet you anything, the installer is going to be an executable
that you would install just like a Ubuntu thing that will be.
Or maybe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's one way to market it.
Just to get it out there on a lot of PC magazines.
And stuff like that, where.
Yeah.
You know, that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought, yeah, certainly the web app approach.
So it's well with netbooks and that.
And originally I think it did when the original PC come out
with a few giga-ram at that.
You know, that was a niche there for the web apps.
But these days, most of those netbooks, they got bloody,
what, you know, 300D cartridges in them, don't they?
So, yeah, practically.
Yeah.
So you're not really saving anything having web applications
anymore, right?
Like, space is no longer an issue.
But I just, I don't think it would be a stretch for anyone
to tell me that they can actually live off of web apps.
I mean, that's just, that sounds right to me.
But obviously they're going to have, I guess, sort of more of a thinking scenario
or you've got your local copy all the time so that when you don't have Wi-Fi
or internet access or whatever.
Yeah, and that would sort of be invisible to the user if that's it or not.
Yeah.
That's why that would be a lot of that sort of thing.
Yeah.
And it would be interesting.
And what can't you do in a browser?
I mean, look at Quake Live.
I mean, you can actually play, you know, an open GL game inside of your browser.
I mean, so there's, I don't know, I think they can do pretty well with this.
But so you're, you're, you're going out the assumptions that Chrome OS is the Chrome browser.
Is that what you're saying?
Or, or you just mean in general.
I think it's a powerful platform.
I just think that they're going to probably integrate, you know, their browser
as the operating system.
So when you fire it up, that's your desktop?
I don't know.
I'm just guessing.
Yeah, I don't, I, I mean, I, the name suggests that, but I just, I can't see that.
I can't, I could be wrong.
I always picture the more like that GLS, where you will sort of go to a desktop,
but the desktop would have your icon of the link to all those net applications.
But certainly, but you're saying, once in a while, I could, yeah, I could see that too, you know?
Yeah, I, I, I just picture as what your desktop is.
One big browser with no, you know, tidal bar up there.
It's just full screen and it's got tabs.
And then when you want to use your office program, you just hit on that tab
and it would open it up.
If you want to browse the net, you hit on the other tab.
Yeah.
Yeah, I, I, I guess I could see that.
Yeah, that would.
Because didn't you see something about creating your own window manager or tyling?
Yeah.
Window manager?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, at least, yeah.
So back to that quick life.
Has anybody tried it?
Yeah.
I had a Mac RAM with it.
I mean, I had any Python for desktop, but certainly RAM, well.
Yeah.
It runs really good.
What I remember, what it was like when I played it all those years ago.
It's placed on the Quite 3 engine.
It said, what are these?
It'll place on Quite 3.
It looked like Quite 3, didn't it?
Yeah.
It is Quite 3, isn't it?
Yeah.
I only played it twice, but, you know, but it ran really nice.
And there's no lag or anything.
I mean, you got it right on full screen, didn't you?
Yeah.
It works a lot better than I expected it to actually.
Usually you have problems getting things like that to work, but obviously they tested it quite a bit before they released it.
And Linux got it quite a bit later than Windows did.
But yeah, it does work great.
So I don't know.
I mean, can someone just...
I don't play games as you probably know, and I don't really have ever really done the whole online gaming thing.
So you go to like QuakeLive.com or something, and you find out for an account or something.
And then you just...
You're dropped into the game, and you just start playing.
I mean, is that kind of like what it is, or...
Yeah, there's a little delay between signing up and getting decked.
Play against people.
They need to download a Firefox extension.
Okay.
So it has to be Firefox then.
I'm not sure exactly what all it works with in Windows.
It would be like an MSI file to install.
I'm just looking...
I'm there now, I guess, on Conqueror.
And it's definitely not loading properly.
Yeah, I wouldn't imagine if it was Conqueror would work.
Was it like a Java interface or something?
How does it work?
Well, they download their extension.
And after that, you get signed in.
And they have to download some of the game data, which takes...
Oh, depending on your connection, it'll be like 10 minutes maybe.
Sure, okay.
And they make sure that they don't make you wait a long time once they get some initial data in.
While you're looking over the site, it'll be downloading the extra stuff that it needs.
Cool.
And part of it, they'll even put you in the training mission to get the rest of the data downloaded.
All right.
The training, basically, you go through and you play against the bot.
And based on how well you do, they put you in the ranking system.
Wow.
And they can figure out which person would be best suited to play against on the multiplayer.
So you're going to get a bunch of people that pretends to be really crap, just so they can work the floor with something new.
That could be a problem, yes.
Although pretty well, if you do that, it would be great to you up.
Oh, I did.
I don't know. Some people seem to find it fun.
Generally, they're the Halo crowd, but...
Well, the thing is, you know, Quaker is an old game.
And a lot of people that's been playing all this time, and, you know, they know every single thing about the game.
Like, exactly where to fire.
And you're probably not going to beat those people.
It's going to take you a really long time to get that good.
You should try it out, Claudio.
I don't think so.
They don't just throw you in, necessarily.
They have a page that you can look at the tips and, you know, figure out certain techniques on how to play.
How do you play with a keyboard, or can you use, like, a...
Dine can use a controller, or something, or...
That's all I'm telling you about.
Yeah, DineTruck 5 on the left top with a touchpad.
Oh.
Messing the keyboard.
Yeah, it's a fast game.
I mean, first-person shooters are generally fast.
You need to...
You know, you have one hand on the keyboard.
W-A-S-D.
Pretty movement.
And you've got to move the mouse pretty quick.
Just to bring back all memory soups will have to die.
I mean, they have one guy fighting.
Right?
Come in.
What do you use now?
Are we 12 or something?
Anything?
Yep.
Played a lot of LAN games on Quick 3.
Yeah.
So I'm assuming this is, you know, free and stuff, right?
I mean, just in terms of, like, cost.
It's not like World of Warcraft where you have to pay your 15 or 30 or whatever it is, bucks a month to get that.
Right.
You're just logging in, and it's all free.
You've got a big red button in it.
It's about to play, man, out and free.
And it keeps track of all your stats.
Cool.
Which mine says I was killed 300 times.
It's fast because as soon as I join a game, I'm like splattered everywhere.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
It's like so fast.
Well, don't you get some seconds after you appear like to kind of get your bearings?
No.
You get a few seconds to watch everybody's shooting everything.
And then when you respawn, I mean, the bullets are flying.
I mean, one time I didn't break loose, and I got to jump.
But as soon as I jumped, I got shot.
Wow.
That sounds kind of strange.
Yeah.
So you're ever, so everyone's playing against each other, basically.
Was it Death Match?
So everyone's together?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody for themselves.
Well, maybe if he tried something a little bit more, I don't know, goal oriented, like, external of just shooting each other.
If there is such a thing, maybe that would work out.
So this will give you an example that one black in here has played 5.6 million matches.
It's quite cool to reach that.
Well, what's that?
Completedly.
4.6 million.
And so, oh, OK, because Windows had this a long time before Linux did.
Oh, yes.
It's 1998.
Oh, quick live.
No, well, Quake 3 is from 1998.
But this is the exact same game.
Well, Quake live is only what I'm rolled.
That might be frags.
5.6 million still alive.
OK.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm trying to read.
Yeah.
I refuse to play anything like that with Monster B, because every time I have, he just team kills me over and over and over.
That's him acting out like a fantasy that he has in his life.
That was an urban terror.
I remember that.
Yeah.
So then I just started shooting him.
Good time.
It is fun.
Before we move on.
Well, you download probably like 8 megabytes, and then while you're doing the training, it downloads in the background.
So it's probably what, like, 20, 30 megabytes altogether for this extension.
It's not too bad.
No.
Well, I'm sure.
I mean, if you're really going to play it, too.
I mean, that's obviously a great thing, because then you get all kinds of, I mean, I must increase the speed substantially, not having to pull down data, you know, via the network all with the data on your computer.
It can reuse all that data.
That seems pretty cool.
I don't know.
That's probably standard procedure for games these days, but I've never really thought about that before.
And it says on their websites for Firefox 2, but it runs perfect in Firefox 3.5.
Cool.
Yeah, it actually looks like the top slide should play about 1100 games.
5.6 megabytes, and the better they will stick with that.
Yeah, it deals like 5.6 million.
It's really only 1100.
It was 1100.
But that tells you that they get into it.
Yeah.
Anything else on Quake Live?
We'll move on to Art B61.
Oh, okay.
I have getting back into the new Linux users, like I usually do.
I found an article in Linux Journal titled Building Linux Audio Applications 101.
It's a multi-tore user guides.
Of course, this is part one, and I'll post the link in the IRC.
And it seems to be a really good, basic set of instructions.
The guy gives some background on why you would want to build audio programs.
Also, some video, it says in here too, but basically what he says is,
anybody who's looking for newer versions of a piece of software
that you can basically build your own.
And again, he talked about why you would do it and why you might not do it.
By building, you're talking about compiling, not like programming a new application.
Right, compiling, yeah.
Where you would get a newer version that might not be in the package manager.
Like I said, he gives you reasons why you would compile one and why you wouldn't.
And he gives you right down to the steps on what to do.
If you want to get it from SVN repository or CVS repository, he writes it out for you.
When was this article written?
September 1st.
Yes, September 1st, this came out.
I just pitched Linux journal an app thing about compiling software.
Like two months ago, and they turned me down.
Oh, they might have this one in the wings.
Yeah, I hope so.
I hope they didn't just reassign it to some other author.
Oh, you might want to do that.
No, they're actually a really good magazine.
Well, this seems to be a really good article.
I'd be interested in reading the next parts of it because the guy sounds like, you know, he's very down to earth.
And, you know, it really breaks it up pretty well on what you have to do.
Yeah, feel really nice.
Yeah, and you know, like, you know, this goes along with what you've been, you know, talking about.
And you're cast and stuff with the different letters on what, you know, like, with the XJVF, you know, on what each one does.
Yeah.
It's just a nice command line for new people.
I mean, you know, it takes the scare out of it.
Yeah.
No, it feels really nice.
It looks like it's talking about, like, make files a little bit.
Yeah.
And it gives you, it gives you, you know, towards the bottom of the article.
Yeah.
It tells you what tools to use, like, auto tools and make and pre-make and...
Yeah.
It seems like a very good article.
I said, I'm looking forward to the next part of it.
It's supposed to be in soon.
Doesn't say one exactly, but...
I'm also talking about Akbar, but it's at the very bottom of it, too.
Cool.
And that's my quick little tip.
Package.
Note whatever you want to call it.
And you guys get the printed magazine for a learning journal?
No, I don't.
I get it off the shelf.
I don't subscribe.
Yeah.
I've been a subscriber for a while, but I'm thinking about just going with the digital purchase.
Digital purchase.
Next time.
I start getting magazines, and I end up with so many of them.
If you miss reading it a couple of years, you get a pile of them.
Yeah.
And that's exactly why I don't subscribe, because I'll do the same thing.
They just seem to...
They come so quickly.
Whereas if I just get it when I happen to be at the bookstore, I'll pick it up.
I know I'm probably paying more for each issue or whatever, but it just...
It works for me.
Because then I got the magazine.
I have to read it.
You know, and I do read every article, every little part of it, so.
Yeah.
From private back.
And a lot of times you'll look at one on the shelf and go, oh, you know, you...
You're not interested in that article.
You're not interested in that article.
So you would only read half of it anyway.
Yeah.
It was like that.
Like, why pay 1095 for a magazine that you're only going to read a few articles.
Yeah.
And you can always print out, I mean, if you get the digital or, you know, looking online,
you can always print out the sections that you want to keep.
Yeah.
Or print the PDF and put it on your note.
You need 800.
Ooh.
Yeah, there you go.
Or your phone with that kind of horsepower.
Yep.
Peter, 64.
I need to follow up with that TC probe thing that you're talking about.
Not too crazy about it, actually.
It doesn't quite give as much information as I would like.
These playing with Hannah Montana leave me alone.
I should follow them.
It's probably trying to figure out how to sing this song.
Yeah.
It's getting the timing down right and everything.
Getting the right beat going, you know?
I mean, TC probe seems pretty nice.
Apparently, if you install transcode, that includes TC probe.
But, I don't know.
It doesn't seem to be quiet as exhaustive as the other one.
But, it is analyzing the stream.
So, in that sense, it is kind of better.
Given you accurate information is what you're saying.
Definitely.
Yeah.
This is really, really the information.
Not just the metadata.
So, I guess, obviously both are definitely good to have.
Well, you said you could use that off the command line too, right?
You know, I don't know.
I need to switch over to something without X.
Let me just switch to a different TTY and actually test it out.
TC probe.
In TC probes only for videos, right?
No, no.
It will do audio as well.
And, yeah, you can do it without X.
So, that is kind of cool.
Yeah, I guess I'll just say both of them are pretty good, actually.
I take back what I just said.
Okay, he wasn't listening anyway.
Yeah.
I don't know.
There are some things.
Yeah.
I guess you just need those.
I mean, that's the thing about these kinds of tools.
You can't just say, okay, I've got this one.
I don't need anything else.
Because, like, it just failed completely to analyze the .slv file,
whereas, the egg of this tool, you just look at that and tell you a lot of information about it.
Like a lot.
Yeah.
It's a nice port about Linux.
You can have them on your machines.
And, as long as you remember that they're there, you know, you can access them easy enough.
Yeah, exactly.
Like you said, you just switch to another terminal.
They've been a little command, and Bingo, there's your configuration.
You can back to the other terminal and do what you're doing.
Yeah, yeah.
Does anyone here use X-Term?
Yeah.
Not on an everyday basis, but I use it sometimes.
When you launchers, have you ever tried this?
I'll put it in the chat room.
With the dash, FN, 10 by 20.
And it actually looks pretty nice.
Well, it doesn't look very good on my system.
No, it doesn't look good.
No.
Why was it look good?
Yeah.
Are the fonts too small or too big?
Too big.
But I just compared it to a normal one, so now I see where you're going with it.
Well, what size is your screen?
12, 80 by 800.
Okay.
The one I'm turning on now is a 12, 80 by 1024.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Well, maybe because I'm 40 and the big fonts look better.
Better, yeah.
Like you could see them.
Yeah, the FN just stands for font name.
I don't know.
Yeah, if you do X-Term dash dash help, it shows all the commands.
So let's put a peg wall on the spot.
You said you didn't have a story.
Yeah, I mean, you've only had like what, two hours to come up with one now.
I bet he still doesn't have one.
Sure don't.
You said last minute stuff is sucks, so I didn't bother.
Tell us something about 330 that we don't know.
Yeah, story.
Something that, when you finish, she's going to punch you that hard for tolerance.
To be honest, there's really not much to tell, because he's the same way on the show.
He, as he is in real life, is just more cussing and yelling very strange things.
How could you live with a person like that?
Uh, usually because I'd cuss all the time, like a saver.
That's where he says a big buck's man in the room.
So he can turn that on, put his head by it so we don't hear anything.
It's a castle curse.
He said cuss.
Yeah, people say cuss, but it's really cursed, but it's the American curse.
It's cursed, it's cuss, yeah.
Are you swear?
Are you swear at all or not?
People swear all the time here, Peter.
Where did you been?
Yeah, yeah, I realized it's swear, but I was wondering you called it swearing or cussing.
Cussing is the polite way to say it.
Okay.
It depends on if you want to sound like a snob or not.
No.
But I don't, it's not even cursing like a sailor.
A curse like an Australian.
Well, you know what, let's go around the table and we'll just say our favorite cuss words.
Clot 2.
Go ahead.
I think darn and heck a lot.
There you go.
Probably way too much.
I say fiddle sticks a lot.
Yeah.
What about Jesus?
I go, I go cheese and crackers.
That's what I go holy cheese and crackers.
What about you, Peter?
Croixie.
Croixie, Mike.
How old are you?
That's just dirty Peter 64.
I'm going to have to change the rating on this show.
We can find out who's got kids right now today.
I say bloody, not that bloody is a swear word these days anyway.
I suppose I say bloody word, anything.
Let's say I often wonder about how many swear words really are swear words anymore.
I mean, they seem to be so common in the everyday,
at least in the group of the people that I hang out with.
It seems pretty much just common language now.
You know, are they really still considered like,
I guess they are because movies still get rated based on, you know, the kind of...
The seven words you can't say on TV.
Yeah, exactly.
And they're still there.
Can you get a story about this?
This is when I decided that the world isn't a nice place anymore.
I just delivered mail.
This is going back in the mid-80s.
I just delivered mail to this house one day.
And there was this kid and he must have been about five or six ten in the front.
And he's waiting at the letter box.
And he said, postive, you got any rubber bands?
Because, you know, you get rubber bands and you flick them and all that sort of thing.
And I said, I haven't got any spare ones.
You know what I said?
You didn't get it yet.
Yes, and so you post it.
Oh, that is no word of a word.
This is coming out of the mouth of a six-year-old.
I felt like getting off my bike and kicking him back through his front door.
But I thought the world has changed.
You know, back in my day, if you didn't say please and thank you, you've got to hide.
Now he can say, yeah, if and see if they don't get what they want.
Yeah.
What a world.
Very well.
Just sort of cheer that with this.
I still, mate, my oldest one is 23 and every time she swears,
I go over and whack her in the back of the head or something and say, excuse me, what did you just say?
And it's like, you see, I won't cuss her in my family or around old people really out of respect.
But that's the key respect.
Yeah.
If you're my age, then it's going to fly.
Well, I just have to slap you.
But when you hit your collar with adults, Mr. Mrs. Anymore.
I still do that.
I would say, I still call my father's friend Mr. and Mrs. from back when I was a kid.
But I cannot think that I've ever been called Mr. Crossed in bloody by anybody.
You know?
Let's look on you now.
Yeah.
Well, let's start looking from the father.
I'll turn around and look for dad.
Yeah.
There you go.
The world has changed.
And I don't know that it's changed for the better.
The problem is, Peter, is that there's nobody around for some of these kids to teach him right from wrong.
Yeah, not done that bad over there, but have they taken the kinds out of school?
Yeah, they don't.
Yeah.
The teachers, the teachers, these teachers over here can't even holler at a kid.
Or they go down, you know, they make a report out.
Yeah.
It hasn't impressed society.
But getting a kind that would never did many of them.
I'm not used to getting the bloody thing once a week.
Yeah.
Thank you.
May I have another?
It didn't help either, did it?
No, but it was a stupid thing to show you a tap you were.
You know?
I got waxed three times as well.
Yeah, I did it.
Be back.
Shit.
When I was in school, the teachers, you sit again in the hallway and throw you up against the lockers and tell you they're going to kick the shit out of you.
You don't straighten up.
I had a math teacher that would throw a stapler at people.
Yeah, I just had a math teacher.
The teacher did the same.
He used to throw whatever was closest.
He'd made out how hard it was.
Hard of the meta.
He also had a racquetball.
And he was really good at bouncing off someone's head and catching it from his desk.
That's crazy.
We've seen your borrowed bloody tape.
Well, it wouldn't be hard to bounce off yours.
That's why people say, what are you doing?
I thought that was a school photo.
Yeah, that was me when I was 20 in the ninth grade.
You were on a 15-year plan?
I think we've got our topic, Tommy.
What's the topic?
We were talking about it.
We were done.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Well, since we picked on Pegwall so much, what's the name of your podcast?
So we can call it even.
Okay.
All right.
First off, I'm going to say sorry to everyone that actually might listen.
Because it's terrible.
It is something to tell.
Yeah, it's fine.
Yes, especially when that 330 gets on.
He fucks it all up.
Yeah.
And I'd also like to say thanks to Clotty for the one episode he was on.
Ever publicized that again.
This is the first time I'm here in this.
What's up with that, Clotty?
You know, Peter 64 told me, oh, come on.
There's a podcast out there.
You know, jump on the end of the call.
And I did.
And I was just shocked.
I was amazed.
That was nice.
Didn't we get it?
You didn't think I-
That might have been Peter 64 anymore.
You never did.
And you can find it at something kind of teching.org.
And Monsterview, you're welcome anytime.
I love having everyone on.
330 said the same thing.
Too bad I got to work that night.
You know, it's probably worth mentioning, Pegwall,
that you-
That something got a tech you went on only.
Oh, you did, right?
No, you're not.
I'm still working on editing all the episodes and getting the, you know,
intros out.
And we also have a theme song now too, which is kind of awesome.
And I'd like to-
I'm going to be from the Linux cranks chat room.
I think I'm pretty much bored.
You're not going to sing it, are you?
No, there's no words to it.
Can't be any words good, either.
I'm going to have him make a song.
I'm going to have him make a song.
I'm going to have him make a song.
Come on, Pegwall.
We had all the words for it.
Something kind of techy.
Doodly doodly do.
Jamie wants the incident.
What are we talking about?
Always chat room.
The incident with hungry room?
You know what the incident is.
Someone you got to talk to when they shouldn't do.
And that's about it.
I'm not going to say anymore.
I want ops monster B, please.
You guys are in probation right now.
What did I do this time?
The incident.
I wasn't involved.
The whole entire channel got shut down that day.
You were the same.
You instigated the incident.
No, I didn't.
I can stigate things Peter, I remember I instigated them.
I remember what happened.
Can you play more in the better than a one day shut down the chat room?
Clot 2 gave Andy Meals.
Pull ops.
I will never forgive him.
He was only ignoring him.
And he started thinking people like crazy.
He didn't just kick people. He just like took over the channel or something.
I have not seen that through the chat in ages.
Well, I haven't either, but I wouldn't because he's on my ignore list.
I would ban if he signs on as Andy Meowth.
He's on somebody else.
He could be married, wouldn't he?
Yeah, he's married now.
He probably doesn't even go near a computer anymore.
He's finally got lucky.
So that's why Mr. Zulk is all because of Clot 2 and Andy Meowth.
Yeah.
I hate to be in the same sentence with that guy.
Because of Clot 2 and my anarchist ideals that totally and utterly failed in IRC land.
But where is Clot 2 still on up?
Yeah, why?
You know, I've reformed my way.
Yeah, right.
Totally not to trust those cat people.
Yeah, exactly.
Speaking of Clot 2 reforming his ways,
the government fed him three states and a small child and he ate them gladly.
That's true.
There's yours.
Oh, and Mrs. Zulk, I forgot how to make people opt.
Yeah, yeah.
So, I don't feel like looking it up.
That is so convenient.
Well, she can look it up for you.
Yeah, but it's the command she needs to put in here.
I'm kind of busy right now.
Why do you guys want apps so bad?
So when people start being an idiot,
she can kick them herself.
Actually, doesn't really matter.
I just get soaked. He does it for me.
I refuse to let him have more control than I have.
If we kick idiots off the channel, it'll be empty.
Oh, man.
I'm not referring to idiots.
I'm referring to stupid prick.
Have we said goodbye?
Have we finished?
We have finished, don't we?
No, we're still rolling.
We may be more finished with that.
Yeah, really.
We have to vote kick somebody.
Don't we?
No, that's not a show, isn't it?
Yeah, but let's do it tonight.
We got sent to the ban all night long.
That's because we're voting tonight.
No, it's because Vogue had me on mute the whole time.
That's probably it.
That might behave tonight.
I'd like to nominate myself to be kicked.
No, we can't fight, keep on this show.
That's cranks.
Yeah, it is cranks.
I want to kick them off.
It's the same way my shoes.
What if we all kick peg wall?
Yeah, let's just do that.
Get it over with.
Well, ask to just send him to the beat.
What do you think of that peg wall?
Yeah.
Come on here and pimp that show.
Come on.
Selfish.
No story and then he comes on and pimp the show.
Yeah.
I'm a whole new like that.
Why doesn't Misha Dan like this anymore?
He never comes on any show.
Misha, we still love you.
Yeah, he hasn't been on my show either.
Are you guys like me where you're pretty busy during the week?
And you really need to meet up with people?
Have you tried go to meeting?
I'm going to go to meeting.
I put it on Twitter.
And you started following me.
And put in promotion code, Titi.
And you will get a 10% discount.
You'll get your 1.2% discount.
But in promo code, Titi, and you'll get nothing.
We should probably end this.
Go on to the after show.
Safety first.
So next Saturday is Lennox Cranks.
And in the following, no.
When will we do another show?
I don't have a calendar in front of me.
You don't have a calendar on your computer?
I'm doing it right now.
NetBSC doesn't allow calendars.
It's a big deal.
Oh, that's right.
He's compiling one right now.
The next tip radio will be September 19th.
That's when we record it live.
So it'll probably be posted around Christmas time.
Yeah.
Well, I'll show a half the show.
We're still waiting on episode 7.
No, I'm going to post that on Monday,
because I do have posting powers for at least a week now.
So that is going to get posted.
And then this episode, whenever you're ready,
let me know and I'll post this one.
Okay, cool.
So I'll see you guys next week for Lennox Cranks.
And...
The following week is a little less, right?
No.
Don't complicate matters.
You know what?
Let's forget all these dates.
Yeah.
Yeah, because we live in the now, man.
Yeah.
I'll send a plan.
I'll see you guys in the after show.
Good night.
All right.
Yeah.
Happy Father's Day.
That's right.
Happy Old Australian Father's Day, Peter.
Yeah.
Happy Father's Day, Peter.
Um...
Greg, when did I do it in Europe?
Uh...
Same day.
It's in the US, but I can't remember.
It's in June.
It's in June.
I think it's the first or second Sunday in June.
I know mothers say it's different in the US and the UK.
To all the Australian fathers out there, I'd like to say good job reproducing.
All right.
See you guys later.
Later, everyone.
Night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Goodbye.

Frippin' to him and all with the clothes we're wrong
This is the hate, it's you, the reason we're wrong
Ego's the power, the praise, and the power comes to us
I'm starting to shake the seal of the throne, and I stop my strength
Ego's the power, the praise is you, the praise is you
Ego's the power, the praise is you
Eat with a bow to mold, and don't seek it, don't tell me
more fruits of sewing control and distance, to remain the left
Āpavaa da da da da ca fertileited
I'm sitting. There's no time now
And let's just keep on, and let's just keep on
If for the wrongful one day, for the evil one
Let's all of each other, we're the thine
And we're real, we're the ones known
And let's just keep on, and let's just keep on
If for the wrongful one, and let's just keep on
Let's all of each other, we're the thine
And we're real, we're the ones known
Let's just keep on, and let's just keep on
If for the wrongful one day, for the evil one
Let's all of each other, we're thine
And let's all of each other, we're thine
And let's all of each other, we're thine
and let's all of each other, we're thine
