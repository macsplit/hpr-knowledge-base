Hello boys and girls from Zen Flotter, your favorite magical forest squirrel, farmer human being
converted into squirrel by aliens in the 1960s and atheists and free software enthusiasts.
I use a lot of free software operating systems and I thought I'd just make a blog if you will,
a audio blog of my progress since investing in Chromebooks and I made an audio that I posted
the first of the year about my experience with Chromebooks. I'm still enjoying Chromebooks.
It seems that Google is providing an update to its Chrome OS like every two weeks.
It's providing an update and of course you know if you're a part of the Play Store and Android apps,
you get a stream of updates. It seems like every day you get two to eight updates every day you check
for the Play Store and of course the Google beta and flat packs where you get updates every week on
that too. So if I can say one thing about Chromebooks, it is rather intensive just trying to keep them
updated because you have to update like four different sources at once. And I didn't mention
that I think I mentioned in the last audio that I joined the Google One program I guess or Google
Plus whatever it is and got what is it? 20 terabytes of hard drive space and used their VPN and some
other services for the Chromebooks for what is it? 99 bucks a year or something like that?
I forget what the price is. Just something like that. Anyway when you look at it, when you look at
$99 per year cost for 20 terabytes, for a lot of people that is actually cheaper and I did the
computations and running an Open BSD server which is what I'm currently running. I'm still running
my Open BSD server. I haven't turned it off. It's still being used to store files.
But I'm experimenting with Google and if you didn't want to play with setting up your own server,
then Google One and you know Google Drive would certainly be one of the more affordable alternatives
that you can still have. And you know the news is out that there are more Chromebooks in play
and the global populace than there are Macbooks now. You know any of the Apple products is just
like what happened with Android. There's more Android phones now than there are iOS Apple phones.
So Google has pretty much dominated the market as far as the PC market goes and you know they've
taken over from Apple even though they're still behind Windows of course.
They're not behind anybody when it comes to cell phones. You know Android I believe is king of
them all. And they attribute that to the COVID-19 thing mainly that Chromebook sales took a rise.
And really I am impressed with my Google Chromebook that I bought the big one. It is an impressive
device but it does keep you occupied more than Slack work times. And you know what I mean by that.
You know constantly recompiling applications and stuff. You know it's a it's a high maintenance
device. I I don't feel at ease with it. Also I'd like to switch conversations and talk about
my Dell Mini 10. If you recall last year I made at least two audio podcasts about my lovely
Dell Mini 10 with the Intel chip that it has in it which is immune to specter attacks.
And the Intel what was it for 50 processor I believe. I'll have to go back and look.
Anyway unfortunately I haven't been able to run the Dell Mini 10. It was running OpenBSD,
the 32-bit version, i36 version of OpenBSD. And I had been went browsing with it and
running G-Pottern everything. But you know as all operating systems become it got so big that
the Dell Mini 10 can't run it. In fact the last efficient operating system it could run
was Connochet OS which was a 32-bit free liberated version of Slackware, 32-bit Slackware for 14.2.
And of course the German people who maintain Connochet OS turned it off because I guess
lack of interest and that's a shame. I cry for Connochet OS and the people that made it. Thank
you so much for allowing me to join your world if you're listening to this. The people
Connochet OS we miss you and I thought what you did was innovative and thoughtful and it worked
really well. I enjoyed it and it's just too bad that it came to an end. But I gather that 32-bit
operating systems are coming to an end rapidly this year and the next I understand
freeBSD is discontinuing their 32-bit efforts. I don't know about OpenBSD, haven't heard anything
about it. I'm sure NetBSD will not be discontinuing it. Their efforts with 32-bit for a while longer.
But you know for every port that they have at any operating system eventually is a death.
I did find it unusual that the Alpha test of Slackware 15, the one that Patrick Volkordink mentioned
on DistroWatch did not have a 386 DVD ISO to test. It was just a 64-bit.
Now I have not downloaded that DVD and tried it because I've been busy with the things but
yeah I don't know if Slackware is going to offer 32-bit version that you would think they would
offer the 32-bit version in an Alpha if they were going to do so. So maybe we're seeing the end
of 32-bit Slackware as we speak I don't know. Time will tell but I did find it unusual that there's
no Alpha there. Maybe they've got one over on Alien Bob site where he's actually the one I believe
that's building the the office for distribution. Well at any rate you know the Dell Mini-10 sadly
and it's Intel N450 processor is sitting their idle in the drawer. It's been running for I don't
know 12-13 years and operating systems have become too big for it. It's not that the machine's broken
it can still run today if it had an operating system run and you know if I put tiny correlinics
on there I could probably run it or maybe I could run it under NetBSD there's a possibility I could
put NetBSD on it and maybe I should just explore NetBSD for the sake of resurrecting the Dell Mini-10
because NetBSD their 32-bit variant is lighter and smaller than OpenBSD uses less memory
but as we all know it's the damn web browsers that keep getting bigger and bigger you know
you you functionally have to have at least a gigabyte of RAM perhaps more 1.2 gigabytes to
effectively run a damn web browser. Now you might be asking well are you still using Figuita?
Well I couldn't run Figuita on the Dell Mini-10 because you know Figuita loads the entire
operating system in RAM so you'd have even less memory to to work with. Now I can't expand
the Dell Mini-10 I believe someone said to two gigabytes of RAM and extend its life a little
further and I'm gonna investigate that. We're gonna I hate to crack the case on it because the
case has been sealed from the factory since the day I bought it and I may just do that and change
out its little 250 gigabyte hard drive was something bigger a spinning hard drive preferably because
I don't like SSDs that much they're kind of expensive and I don't know I kind of like the
the spinning hard drives I like the older things it's like I I still like to burn DVDs and CD
ROMs with burners even though everyone has gone to DDing an image to a USB portable memory stick
drive I've still like to burn images even OpenBSD has discontinued the ability to burn DVDs
you have to get you have to actually get a DVD that is re-writeable to use OpenBSD system to
burn an image record an image to a re-writeable DVD now it has to be re-writeable DVD
they they set it up that way so k3b and base row and and except burn and whatever else you might have
had there they're gone from the utilities you can't burn a DVD without OpenBSD anymore they
you know and I hate to call them fascists but they are they're people that push us on
it's kind of like the story with the Dr. Seuss books you know let me just tell you a story about
Dr. Seuss from the perspective of an older boomer you know Vietnam era boomer one that actually
wrote code on mainframes from the 1960s as a teenager when when we saw the first
books from Dr. Seuss and we started reviewing them as adults that they were proposing to
have our children read these books and I look through some of them I thought it was really
quite bizarre and that the person that wrote them must have been of the same mindset as Timothy
Leary that he was on LSD or one of these high-prior drugs from Los Angeles and I was just sort of
out of his mind and you know crazy and we were all against it and then when they came out with
the live action cartoons you know and we're talking about the 1970s sometime I forget exactly when
but when they came out with the live action cartoons for instance the Grinch who stole Christmas and
I forget what the cat in the hat and I I forget all the others we thought it was even weirder
you know and we weren't sure that this is a good mental thing to be feeding our children you know
there were just certain TV shows and things that I would ban around my house you know I won't
mention some of the others but you know that was the era of Bob Keegan Captain Kangaroo and
if you liked him he was okay but you know even back then I thought strangely of Big Bird and Sesame
Street even though it was an educational program I thought that I felt uncomfortable with some of the
fuzzy references that they were making strangely though I didn't feel uncomfortable about the
muffits I didn't feel uncomfortable about the muffits they were anything that was a comedic you
know I had a little comedy base to it I seemed to adapt more than I would just strange people with
strange characters not being comedians not bringing any levity to it I don't know it's just maybe
a personal problem of mine so I noticed today the the far leftist you know the extreme leftist
are banning all Dr. Seuss books from anywhere they can find I noticed the the story on Timkass
today about how the leftists have got all of Dr. Seuss's books thrown off of eBay people that
tried to buy and sell used Dr. Seuss material it's been thrown off so you see in in my mind is a
boomer some of these people who are I mean ultra leftists what I'm going to call them communist
that find that they have problems with Dr. Seuss and and even Disney and their problems with
the muffits I guess and whatever else has been going on it does reflect back to a somewhat
right-leaning boomer from the 1970s you know a person that carried a rifle for a few years
just I'm sorry but I had to put that out but it does kind of explain my my love affair with Open
BSD and some of the more console-based Linux distributions does not explain my love affair for
Chromebooks though I mean my love affair for Chromebooks is certainly weird and doesn't fit that
that paradigm if you will well let's move on I've got some news to tell you as of Open BSD68 I was
just cruising through the Open BSD website and I noticed in their facts that they are admitting
that you can now run the webcam in Open BSD and I didn't think that they would ever came
to come so I made a video and I've posted a delivery and bit shoot on my Zen Flutter 2 account
of me making a screen recording using Open BSD the webcam and recording server-political
videos of which I'm not going to post here I'm not going to post links to them on Hacker Public
Radio not because I'm afraid of doing it but because the the medium of Hacker Public Radio
I think has always been known and it's been defined that this is a technology-related
website and not so much political and perhaps I go too far on the political sometimes
but it was exciting to be able to do an Open BSD what we have done in Linux for years
so they'll be a studio anyway I wrote a bunch of scripts got the webcam going finally
on this one Dell laptop it's an older laptop and I found that I could do the same thing and
figure it to pretty easily and started recording using this blue parrot microphone that I bought
the USB microphone that I'm using right now to make this recording which hopefully the audio
will sound good I know you can hear a a the sound of an ultra spark fan in the background
that's not actually an ultra spark it is the the house air conditioning I make my recordings from
the downstairs which is a basement and that noise that you're hearing that I should probably try
to filter out using audacity for I post this recording is not an ultra spark processor fan but
the the house they see coming on because it's still a little cold here in Oklahoma it's not freezing
but it's the the heater and the heat pump has to kick on so anyway I made that this multimedia
recording on Open BSD and it lasted for almost an hour I made a couple of them and I posted them
up to my video site so you know if you're curious as Zen floater number two just as I spell it
here in hacker public radio you can easily search it on the bit shoot or library and that's the only
two alt tech sites that I'm on as far as videos other than gab and you might wonder why I want to
be on gab because I'm a brain sander supporter and it does sound strange but really I'm on gab I
guess for the same reason a lot of people are on on on on their independent social sites is that
they don't have to watch others be censored off like what's going on on Facebook and Twitter
and and previous to that Google plus you know you you might not like your neighbors and you can
mute them but you don't have to worry about finding some group of oligarchal madmen who are
and I call them madmen even though they in many cases as with I've just pointed out with
dr. suce books they act just like I did back in the 70s so I guess if they're madmen I'm madman
but you know there has to be a limit to our power doesn't there I mean we we can't just walk
all over people and expect them to like it anyway I'm kind of dedicating this audio to three people
really the first of which let me just get my web browser up and I need to go to hacker public
radio site to look up the names of a couple of people but and I want to make sure and pronounce
this name I've got it on the tip of my tongue it's haku no that's not right let me get it correct
Jesus I'm so horrible with names sorry about that people let me find the home latest shows
the first one of course is mr ex a long time friend of hacker public radio talking about
upgrading his lubu to on my samsung n150 plus netbook at hpr 30 to 85 I just finished listening
to that and it was an interesting performance and mr ex and I have the same opinion on old laptops
and and older you know Linux operating systems and also stuff like midnight commander which is
you know basically a clone of norton commander from the 1980s back when they introduced that on
DOS if you recall you know they gave us a midnight commander clone norton commander that was a
freewire application as you could use which everyone was just thrilled with because none of
us back then wanted the command line we wanted to menu driven this and that because we're all
from the commercial in the mainframe world you know we I don't want to type in anything on a console
so I mean we're all hot potatoes about stuff like midnight commander and I still use midnight
commander from time to time even though there are are certain younger hacker people who are
anti midnight commander anti debian and and it shows all right and scrolling backwards again
there's another one I wanted to give kudos to who's some guy on the internet who's posted multiple
shows but hpr 32 82 was his last one hp laptop with AMD Ryzen 3 mobile and radian graphics and
you know it's always interesting to hear people toy ran with it and toy ran with linux and older
machines and I hope that that spirit never dies and then the last one is let me look his name up
because you know I always botch it ahuka there we are my Chromebook experience 32 65 then he
posted on the second of February of this year 2021 thank you ahuka you know ahuka I tried to
post a comment to your you know show thanking you for the comments and finding them very interesting
I'll just have to do it in in person here my own audio cast because I was unable to post the
comment I got some strange message back anyway I don't want to go after the the people that run
hacker public radio about the comment system as you know I'm against pluses and minuses from my
google plus days or youtube days when I used to have you know six to eight thousand people follow me
I still have one video up there that's got like I don't know what is it now 32 to 40 thousand views
or something like that that I never deleted anyway I'm I'm anti grading social grading I am
even on bit shoot I tell people not to leave comments because I'm not going to read them I
and I'm happy that the the platforms that I'm on don't have pluses and minuses well gab does
they have a plus they don't have a minus you think they'd have a minus they had a plus but I don't
look at them I mean if you the best policy is if you don't like somebody just ignore them don't
try to eliminate their free speech or meet them but I I just finished listening to bad voltage
and they had john abacon on there and his pal and I forget his name he sounds like one of the
characters from around the world 90 days I forget his name and then they had the guy from
Ubudo on there filling in for for for one of their people let me pull up bad voltage here
because you know I've forgotten all their names isn't it mr steward isn't his name let me let
me look it up here bad voltage here we go I'll get this in just a second that's one of the
beauties of having a web browser you can look at wall you're a weaponized rooster here we go
let's see who's who's listed in there yeah Alan Pope was the special guest car steward
legrange and john abacon and they were all talking about social media sites you know and
what they would do to make twitter and facebook better and Alan Pope suggested on
that their latest podcast here which happens to be the weaponized rooster 3x24
from bad voltage Alan Pope suggests that what they should do is create more localized for your local
area sites that aren't global or national in basis and that way you can exercise free speech and they
they all gave a high five up to the notion that if you had somebody that was making political
commentary in a bar they should be thrown out and and told that they cannot return to a bar
comparing a social site to a pub so anyway and great Britain at least with a significant number of
people they believe that the best way to maintain peace and order is to violently throw people out of bars
anyway let me move on here what else did I want to talk about oh yes this particular laptop that I
have here is a seven or eight year old Dell with an i5 in it and you know I've been trying various
Linux distributions and as you know for door 33 I think it is has been out for a while or whatever
the latest version is and I decided well you know it's been a while since I gave a door 33
a spin I can afford to put it on this laptop and see what I think about it and you know I wasn't
going to run you boo-doo because you boo-doo I wasn't going to put 2004 on here or 2010
because of snaps and stuff like that and and they're trying to get away from Debian packaging
and save money on and having to package applications because they're going to let people
independently do their packaging using snap and you know having thought about that that's not a
bad idea except it could create problems for for distributions like Triscoe who doesn't want to
engage in flat packs or snaps even though if you notice on Triscoe 9 you can actually install flat
packs on Triscoe 9 it's allowed now whereas in Triscoe 8 they had been banned because flat packs
are full of nastiness you may not install flat packs you know you couldn't you couldn't install
flat pack at all on Triscoe 8 and somehow magically they changed into Triscoe 9 to where you can
now install flat pack and so I I was experimenting with Triscoe 9 a month before and found that out
and I just like to say basically the the same thing applies towards snaps and anything you
boo-doo's come up with I mean let's take a look at you boo-doo as a battleship a canonical as a
battleship on the high seas from Great Britain as opposed to say maybe red hat which is another
battleship from America on the high seas and you have these three battles that they've had in the
past you've had the wail and mirror battle you've had the upstart system D battle and you've had
the desktop battle known three to unity and an all three counts are British allies have withdrawn
and now they're going for the snaps and the snaps just sound like a revolutionary ideas of course
so does flat packs and we'll see where that goes but you know the more I think about snaps the more I
think about the play store on my Google Chromebook because essentially that's the same thing oh you
know it the play store is in reality what canonical would like to see snaps become
anyway I I think you can guess what's going to go on from there but yeah it's already here on
Chromebooks we'll see if you boo-doo manages to make anything of it you know all the more power to
them but I I wouldn't use you boo-doo distribution because of that and so I tried up Fedora and you
you know you boo-doo had started the the tradition that they weren't going to allow programs like
shutter on board because they were still written to compile against GTK2 libraries and they wanted
everybody to modernize to Python 3 level and also to GTK3 and dump all your programs that still
rely on GTK2 they're trying to clean the operating system up and you know I have to give them kudos
for doing that for wanting to do it Fedora has been trying to do that as well and so programs like
shutter you'll find don't exist on you boo-doo and they don't exist on Fedora you can't get it
so you have to download a flat pack or install something else for a you know a different kind of
screen capturing cutting and pasting program you know if you want to make snapshots of your screens
or windows you have to find another program because shutter is no longer there
well I I happen to go over to slack builds and I saw that they still have the slack build to build
shutter there I don't know if it'll still be there for slack or 15 when it finally comes up but I'm
assuming it will because slack or 15 slack work you know those people over slack work Patrick
Vulcardink he doesn't throw anything away you know he's very pro midnight commander even though you
might not be so I mean his operating system has all the old goodies and I might be giving that a
try when it comes out on this particular laptop but but for now I noticed when I installed Fedora
on this laptop I found out I couldn't install MPV it wasn't in the repose you know they had
other programs in their VLC as a recall I think they had audacity and adacious but you know
there were just certain programs that were missing and many of whom have been replaced by some
sort of strange flat pack that it wasn't even sure if it was free software or not you know I
do they even put on there you know and your flat pack is it is this flat pack totally free
software or not you know what's in what's in the flat pack I don't know I have a hard time going
through an auditing some of that stuff so anyway I got angry and threw a what they call an Australian
demi spat trying to go international here and I got out my my memory stick that has
uh burned on at a copy of LMDE for Debbie which is a Debian based distribution and I know a lot of
you don't like midnight commander you don't like Debian so I installed that on here because it has
all the older software and much to my surprise after I got it uninstalled all installed I found out
that they removed a shutter from Debbie as well it's gone so even the Debian people are being
fascist I can't believe it I should check Dev1 I've got Dev1 installed another laptop over here
and see if they have shutter on that uh yeah I don't know it looks like shudders a thing of the past
I guess I don't know if it shudders even on Gen 2 anymore anyway I think shudders probably a thing
of the past that's a shame of course and up in BSD I used screen grab or screen fetch
and that's how I would get it if I wasn't running om3 which has its own screen capture program
you know if you're trying to build you know pictures of your console or something for a document
you know you need something so at any rate here I am I've got LMDE for Debbie and I've
did all the updates got it installed it only took me a couple hours to set this thing up I mean
it's a breeze and it just works so perfectly I mean the cinnamon desktop is always appealed to me
I'm being pampered I feel the hand of authority on my my my hind end here patting me along as I
push buttons to make software come to life and install software and I'm being I'm being held
by my mother when I'm running LMDE literally
even the flat packs you know installed from the software store without me having to do anything
to the system other than install flat pack of course
I've got two or three flat packs on here installed a bunch of software and I'm using it to
make this recording right now LMDE for and I realized that LMDE is a rolling release and it's
had a bad history of you know when LMDE for becomes LMDE 5 and they come up with another name
for it and we have to roll into that as an upgrade it'll probably fail that's been my experience
of LMDE well that'll be a pity I guess I'll just have to reinstall at that point time
but I sure like it I mean it's it's nice and it's smooth and it it's familiar to me and it doesn't
bug me like Nome 3 does even though I was running Nome 3 on an Open BSD it is a nice desktop and
all that we don't have cinnamon on Open BSD if we did I'd probably run it but they they don't have
that I believe they have plasma 5 them even though I've never installed it but I will take
and figure it out I mainly just when I do the DTJ setup thing that you know the utility that
just type DT and hit the tab bar from Figuita you'll notice if you when you're logged into root
it'll take you to the desktop setup and you can pick a non-windom manager like the Icewindom
manager and he's got a really beautiful setup for that and I run the Icewindom manager most of
the time when I'm getting Figuita it's what I really want to do so anyway getting back to bad
voltage and Ellen Pupp's comments about how we should you know make these small social sites
that only cover say maybe the area of London or something and and don't allow a whole lot of people
into it other than locals over the internet that would be really hard to manage but you know it's
not really the social side in my opinion that's the problem or the people that's the problem you
know I know many of you say that well we've got bad people got to get rid of them no you're not
you're not going to imprison or put in a mental institution 70 million Republicans that's not
going to happen any more than apparently we're going to imprison however many BLM or Anifer out
there that's not going to happen either but rather what I want to point out to is that the internet
has provided mankind for the first time ever in all these centuries gone by the ability to
communicate on a global basis and really get to know your neighbor and now that we have the
capability of getting to know your neighbor we don't like our neighbor we don't like this and it's
we're clashing and it's funny because you know I did mention that I was a hammer radio operator
still am from the 1960s forward and when I talked to somebody in Europe or Russia you know I
back then it was a sub union you couldn't hardly get anybody in China to come on they didn't have
any hammer radio operators in communist China back then because no one had any shortware
videos except unless you were government station you know back then Israel had like
three or four operators so if you managed to get a hold of somebody in Israel it was
functionally an act of God you could talk the admins and Scott station on the south pole
which I used to work routinely through the 70s allowing scientists to make phone patches
and communicate with loved ones here in North America on 20 and 40 meters I did that for decades
until the government put up the cell phone satellite that allowed the scientists to make phone call
phone but it used to be that they would patch right through this house and I'm standing and I
have all the radio gear over here in a special room that's still sitting there with the phone patch
equipment and the antennas and everything are still up and we used to run operations for the
US government and also embassies overseas deployed military on Mars the military amateur radio
service so yeah I've been into it in and out even space communication satellite space communication
so I've been all over the board on it and the internet is really the problem it's not the
social science it's not necessarily Twitter even though what they're doing with Dr. Seuss
seems perverse to a lot of people I'm at ease with it because I know eventually they'll quit
doing it and they'll let people sell Dr. Seuss books again they they're just going through these
phases of where they've discovered that they have a special power that they can use to to censor
people and disrupt what had been considered the normal course of social conduct and try to
insert something else you know I kind of view Twitter and Facebook the same way that I view
maybe the Catholic Church being a former member of the Catholics you know my mom was Irish you know
my mom's relatives were all members of the IRA or Sinn Fein whatever you want to call it
you know in the past my great grandfather was an IRA bomber who was banished from Ireland and
ended up moving to the United States to work on the railroads
so yeah I'm well versed in familiar with all that and I'm certainly an atheist today I'm not
a member of any of those things but yeah the problem with with social media is that we were on the
internet doing it and the internet's a wide open field just like shirtwear radio was and you
know back in the shirtwear radio days if you if you contact with somebody in Japan you talk about
the weather you talk about what kind of radio you're wearing what kind of antennas who you might
have worked in the last week you know and got a QSL card from which is confirmation contact
and you'd have some rather light conversations they would warn you in the FCC regulations that
you know you you were self regulated in that they they would discourage you from getting into
political conversations the people overseas in fact in the oblasts in the Soviet Union they would
have a watchdog walking across the different radio tables because in the Soviet Union if you were
a hamburger operator you had to go to a government station and there'd be three to eight shirtwear
radios set up on different antennas and there would be a member of the Communist Party watching
over you as you operated the radio so they were very limited in what they'd say and if you got a
hold of somebody in the Soviet Union it was generally just high by your signals five nine and the
weather here is you know whatever in centigrade you know because they weren't on Fahrenheit
that reminds me I heard somebody shame us for still using Fahrenheit and measuring distances in
miles feet and inches when everybody else has gone to metric so they're really trying to go after
everything and the last time I remember they tried to implement the metric system in the United
States was in the 1970s and kind of fell in its face no one wanted to do it because we had so much
already tied up in our current um imperial system that uh we didn't want to to switch to the
metric system not even for temperatures so you know there's all kinds of differences between you and
me uh and those differences are probably not going to go away so trying to engineer new bullet
proofs social sites is not going to be the the ultimate answer to everything uh what I find the
ultimate answer is is called tolerance it's a very simple word a very simple word it's called
tolerance you you have to have tolerance if you want to be able to interface with your
neighbors because your neighbors opinions are going to be different and in some cases in your
judgment maybe an educated ill-advised uh opinions or maybe um you uh want to create a social
site where it is basically just a giant echo chamber of ideology which is what Twitter is becoming
for leftist extreme leftist I mean if you're a centrist Democrat you're being banned from Twitter
you forget Republicans uh they're just taking ideology to um unbelievable level
anyway I'll conclude and say that when slacker 15 comes out I think I will try it and see if I
can compile shutter on that because I'm afraid um compiling something by hand maybe the only way
we get use of such software because shutter is not available on LMDE and it certainly was never
available on OpenBSD you know um OpenBSD is really just just forthcoming in eliminating what they
consider to be rubbish like k3b or basero or exf burn you know the ability to burn a DVD or CD they
they just throw it out throw it out throw that stuff out we're not doing it uh just like you
Buddha is throw out anything that's based on GTK through it throw out anything that's based on
Python two seven or whatever throw it out get rid of it we need to get rid of this old junk
and modernize and you know they have a point they have a point so maybe we'll see shutter again
someday under a GTK three uh linked against GTK three libraries and it will return someday who knows
who knows anyway let's all say a prayer I know I'm an atheist but let's
say a prayer for my delmini ten I mean you've served me well baby you're still so beautiful
and shiny there's not a scratch on that thing the battery still works great it's just that the
humans don't like you anymore they don't make any software that will run on your Intel N450 dual
atom CPU in one gig of memory I can still run a console 386 open BSD and of course you know
Linux you could do that yeah but the days of running a web browser forget it forget it in fact I
wonder if maybe the next big step for me and I know this is just silly talk because I've got a
Chromebook sitting over I've got two of them sitting over here and I've got plenty of machines with
with more than one gig of RAM but I get so radical and so tied up on this that for two days I was on
i386 Figuita just using links and Delo the how with Firefox and Chromium
because that's what Kyle mode is using over in nipon japan the the the man that creates it he
uses those he doesn't fire up a large web browser not not at all so that would mean that there's
a lot of sites that I couldn't use I might not even be able to upload a follow the hacker public
radio maybe we should try that maybe somebody should offer a tutorial that knows something more
about hacker public radio can found or somebody that is experienced can you interface with hpr
and upload content using links the text-based web browser or Delo is it possible could we
maybe make a subset community that is just going to walk away from Java and stuff like that
java powered you know all the tracking one one of the ways that you can avoid tracking is just
to avoid the web browser right I mean that's that's a concern of course all my commentary is starting
to sound anti-social isn't it even though it's not I mean I could still if I could upload files
and stuff using just links then why would you want to fire up Firefox you know
if I could get the links to certain youtube videos and use the youtube downloader
then why wouldn't I want to do that you know well I got another tip for you before I cut it off
um the youtube downloader program and up in bsd of course is obsolete I mean it's one from
earlier last year it won't download anything off youtube so what you can do is if you have
that installed in up in bsd just go out to user local bin and delete youtube dash dl just delete it
and then install the youtube version from youtube download was website using the witt command
and do a change mod on it and on the top line change that to what it says to user local bin
slash python 3.8 get rid of the environment variable just have it directly call python 3.8
and you'll find that it will start working again I know many of you probably have wondered
how to do that but anyway that's how you get it done and and make youtube work again even though
there should be somebody from open bsd should have put out a more modern youtube downloader on
the package ad you know on our sites and allowed us to upgrade naturally didn't happen
anyway I can't think of anything else to talk about and it's coming up on
close to 50 minutes and you know that's enough
farmer human being converted into squirrel and atheist commentary for I think one podcast
and again let me remind you the date of this podcast is the fifth of march 2021 on a friday

um section see if it's if it's going to be posted a month later or whatnot
