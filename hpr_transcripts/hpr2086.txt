Okay, that's the coffee in. Hello everybody and welcome to another slightly delayed edition
of Hacker Public Radio Community News. Join me this evening is Dave.
Hi everybody. Okay and for those of you new to HBR, this is a community podcast network
where the people who listen to the shows are the people who contribute the shows that
includes us to guinea pigs for the moment and this show is open to anybody at all to
contribute to and to join. We normally have it at the what's the very complicated algorithm
Dave. It's the Saturday before the first Monday of the month. Yes and if you think that's
easy to tell computers then yes please do a show about how you how you can do that how
you can put that into your calendar. Yes. So where are we? Yes so this show is basically
an idea where we go through the episodes and the new hosts that have joined in the previous
month so that and anything else that's hit the mailing list if you haven't subscribed
to that which you should or anything else that has been posted on the OHS feed if you haven't
been subscribed to that which you should. So do you want to introduce the new host Dave?
Well yes that's going to take a very short space of time because there are none this particular
month. Yes here we are in the shark fin times Dave you know what I mean by that we get a lot
of shows and then we get no shows we get a lot of new hosts then we get no new hosts. It's
the summertime in the northern hemisphere at least and this is fairly typical of this time of
year but again lots of shows come in and shows trickle out one thing that never stops is the
out trickling of shows. The in deluge of shows comes from time to time but what I would like to
see is regular shows coming in all the time from people and if you have you know if you want to
burst up a small series or a whole bunch of shows that's fine you can just space them out over
the coming weeks every two weeks or so but more information is available on the give shows section
of the website. So shall we go through the shows for this month starting at 2065 which was a what's in
my bag show by Tony Hughes and he's carrying a Lenovo 201 a Lenovo 200 tablet a Lenovo 61s some
Raspberry Pi stuff portable SSD and a sign off. It's good to carry those. You got to carry your
sign off the internet it's in this box. All internet. Anyway good show there from Tony who
I think he got donated these Lenovo's if I'm not mistaken. Yeah I think so yes he seems to have
got some some older machines from various sources which sounds quite desirable. Yeah and I
mean press that he has bags for every occasion as well he mentioned. Yeah he does a lot of stuff
with the Raspberry Pi run the Raspberry Pi's jams and stuff like that as well you see. Yeah good
space in the community. Yeah I think Blackpool and Manchester and stuff seem to be very strong
on Raspberry Pi jams. Yeah cool stuff well done Tony and no comments for that show if ever you
want to give some feedback to shows please do so either email the host directly or leave a comment
if you go to the shows link on the website you can leave a comment to those shows right there.
So the next day was the community news there were two comments on that Dave. Epikannis was telling
us this is a thing of beauty I haven't listened to the episode but I must say the inclusion of HTML
and the feed makes the community news entries much easier to read. They used to show up as a
smash together master of text and the feed reader spiffy work well thank you very much you
replied Dave. I didn't actually know I just replied to the fact that during the show we took
best a series stuff and I got confused between the series page that I'd improved and the tag and
summary list the one the one is dynamic the series pages dynamic and the tag and summaries is
regenerated with a spokesperson every time there's a change so but it's probably nobody noticed
and it's it was just me but I thought I'd just like to be on the record as having made a mistake.
No that's that's nothing I thought at the time it was a bit strange which we were saying
but actually you make a good point that coming on the record and correcting stuff is something that
everybody should do I always think it's a bit it's a bit strange when we criticise politicians
for what for what we admire in scientists but sorry you changed your mind yes well new facts came
to light and I changed my mind why would you not yeah exactly so okay the following day was
John Duart with a haste the piss bin alternative never ever heard of this and took it from John
Coulpe's show notes on blather intro and I completely missed it back then maybe I didn't but it
seems easy enough to install and you got yourself a a quick server where people can post all
sorts of dangerous stuff randomly yeah yeah yeah I had to come across it I followed it up when I'd
heard John talking about it some while back but and it looks really nice I don't currently have a
use for it being on an ADSL link my upload speed is incredibly low so I suspect it wouldn't do
me any good to try and run that at home but yeah worth thinking about if you if you want to do that
type of thing it's like actually quite nice I think for a if you're an internal team and you just
want somewhere to put put this sort of stuff that you don't want to be putting that on paceman
because quite often like you just want to dump some text when you're on a conference call or
something like that so I might actually install this on work on one of our servers pretty cool
pretty cool one of these things where you know you're going to spend two hours sometime in the
future going I know I heard a show about that where was yes yes this is why we need tags on our
shows and to be able to search them that's exactly was that was that the right did I say the right
thing there you go yes and if you want to help out with that then you can go to the contribute
section of the HBR website and find out how to contribute tags the next day was podcasts I listened
to and how I fetched them which was interesting actually I always like these shores and I think we
should think we should have a opium l feed of these recommendations under this series I wouldn't
mind keeping that as well in the series you know in the series summary Dave if you can make a
note to remind me in the series summary to have a link there whenever people get to this that we
maintain a list of all these podcasts would be pretty cool to do I think don't want to step step
on Dan's the Linux link.net but some of our recommendations have extended beyond that I must say
oh yes yes no you're quite right it would be lovely to have a sort of generic file of
all of these sorts of things yeah cool good idea all righty and through lots of them the
Duffercast which is well due for a new episode any of these terms lots of these have heard before
some of them I've never heard before either which is always great and there was an um
but oh by the way there's a new podcast I'll call you random done by the book club and I'm shocked
that the book club have an announced that podcast on this feed and I was just listening to those
during the week actually and in the third episode they they commented that I was they I was a nice guy
and all the rest but Dave I think you can attest to the fact that I am a garbage item so don't
don't anybody be falling under the delusion that I'm a nice guy I am far from us thank you very much
okay I'm not saying anything you know because I've got the I've got the the goods in you mate
so the comments there were three comments here one was by cyber grew would it be
grew cyber grew I read that yes cyber group g-patter was slow in my case because it was indexing all
the files in its folder to maintain an internal database you can set options in g-patter to
delete after an x number of days you can manually clean up files in the application that said I never
delete the underlying files because it's a cause causes the g-patter database to become desynchronized
which causes its own set of problems I you know one thing I regret actually is deleting all the
podcasts that I've downloaded through the years yeah yeah why why particularly because people say
oh once it's on the internet it never disappears and that's not true once it's on the internet
the metadata never appears disappears but the reference to the files themselves the files
often disappear and are gone and are nowhere to be found so I mean we make an effort to put
them on archive.org and you know hopefully that will continue as a very worthy project if you
want to help out you can always throw them a few shackles but quite often I've been looking for
files like and the site's gone off there and turned into a porn site and you know
the files themselves are nowhere to be found yes yes I do I have seen this yeah you're right you're
right and it's a big job that I would have thought yeah but I mean at the time yes it was a massive
amount of data but I'm thinking now you know a four terabyte disk drive is like you know it's a lot
of money but you could have all the open source podcasts ever created there but anyway archive
okay yes next comment comment two is from Frank and he says as a slackware user I sort of kind of
new of the church of the subgenius praise Bob but it's a meaning I don't get I'm afraid but I
have not stumbled over their podcast all I can say is have very strange as an aside I use pod
get to get my pods I used to use pod racer until it didn't like me anymore none of that fancy
gooey stuff for me yeah I pod catchers I'm very tempted to do so much stuff with XML I'm very
tempted just to use you know XML Starless and pull it down with that but the problem is
then you have to build all the other stuff where people are doing it wrong because the
OSS spec is such a terrible terrible specification oh yes that yeah everybody has implemented it
because it's so loose everybody's implemented it their own way they seem to be a bunch of
services that you can sign up to and some of them have done the the podcast thing very very very
strangely indeed yeah so yeah they they they cause me enormous amount of grief so what
essentially is a two-line bash script turns into like a 200 like mash potter basically pages
upon pages of workarounds and stuff and yeah the next comment was by Falky thank you for the show
I to use pod get talked about it on app 111992 my pod get sales nearly all files and folders
named with the date and he puts in the date setting there that way you can listen chronologically
and easily delete all you listen to without and needing to know it for every file you don't have
to use a cleanup function on pugget either did you set the most recent equal xx and pugget rc to
set it to 30 and it works on the questions I was thinking between devices he recommends using
rsync and he's wrote a script which is up on github called bpack pod for inspiration
so have a look at that why don't you yeah that's that's quite good it's it's amazing how many people
sort of done their own stuff around this this sort of barrier and yeah it's it's a fascinating
thing to go and look yeah what I've done it's one of these things how difficult could it be questions
yeah yeah been there I was explaining to a lady with the other was there was a
disaster while not catastrophic there was a lot of coming home on the train one day the other day
and they're doing maintenance on one of the lines in terms of now and the other line out one of
the other lines out a train broke down so then you know people were they didn't know where they were
she was going oh but they should know where all the trains are I said yeah they do know where the
trains are and that sign is calculating how long it's going to take the train to get there to hear
under normal conditions yeah but if this was an airplane they I go okay this no stop it's they
it's the traveling salesman's problem it's extremely difficult to solve this issue
really much more difficult in your imagine yeah yeah yeah that's what you're saying you know if
this happened in Skippel all the planes will be falling out of the sky and I go no because the plane
doesn't have to travel on that specific piece of air yes you it's you know which plane has got the
most fuel in it or the least fuel in it well let's land those first and yeah basically divert the
other ones to other airports and feeling that you know pick the ones that have got the most people
in them and try and land those first you know it's it's cruel but cruel but fair oh yes so yes
yes I wouldn't want to be in that that line of work but not necessarily either but the computer
algorithm if you take all the motion away from it is fairly simple it's a lot simpler than you've
got a network a network with trains on it that you can't physically it's even more difficult than
internet routing protocols because you've got physical trains that need to move you can't just
dump the packets are you enough enough enough enough about that sorry JK John Colp did county stuff
in Libra office calc and it's amazing how many people are I don't know is it time in your life
when you start getting fascinated by Libra office calc but John Colp and on you you random
poke it was also going on about how how how he just finally finally saw the light of spreadsheet
it was pretty pretty cool yeah yeah it's John's manifesting manageritis it'll be PowerPoint next
different careful absolutely it'd be right if you're doing Gantt charts but this is actually
this is actually quite useful stuff some of products and counting if which I've never known about
that I yeah I did know about count if yeah but I didn't know the other one so you know I just
found count if cause I needed it and then you know you don't look any further but these are the
count ifs is also rather cool and some product is great yeah and be easy also had very good thing
about some if which is similar instead of counting your son the values and the given range
so I know whatever you say about anything you know we I quite often will produce a you know
big problem we solved it there it is and here's a text file explaining what's come around
and unless you put it into an x file spreadsheet with a graph and put it on some sort of visual dashboard
it's it's okay for engineers it's not okay for mortals yeah so sometimes this stuff helps
okay absolutely so one comment from be easy that you just alluded to which who says
thanks for the quick tips I already know about count if there's also a function called sum if
which is similar instead of counting it with sum up the values of a given range if criteria
is met should be armate sorry sorry pedantic criteria armate because it's a plural in another range
so he gives an example of how a spreadsheet might look and how you would apply a sum if to it
some product was new for me I've already started to use it keep up the informative shows
cool so the next day was adventures with Jonathan solcom join me in an audio and visual okay fix
the pronunciation before we go on as you can say it's slocom slocom fine join me with an audio
adventure for captain slocom and another Robert W service ballad which is happy birthday David
third third time doing a show yeah great idea yes I always like to like David's idea of doing this
and absolutely why not why not we only need two hundred and ninety other people to decide to do that
and we solved our problem there absolutely yeah that's kind of cool all the stuff all the links are
on there to the various different pages and even a youtube movie frank commented on this it was
nice to hear the project goop goop and berg and librvox get some publicity and there are two of
the most worthwhile projects on the inner webs I wholeheartedly agree with him about that project
goop and berg been public putting putting stuff into the public domain and librvox taking that
stuff and converting it to audio books so project goop and berg any books that are out of copyright
and should go into should go up there our authors can choose to put it up there straight away
do you know what I would like to do Dave I was just walk up the other night the way you do with
a revelation I would like that if you are not able to purchase our veil of a piece of copyrighted
work within a year and a day it should be made public it should go automatically into they
into the public domain I think that would okay so for example a show comes on you for books and
stuff so you want to you want to you know what the Disney films not that are more kids wherever
into the Disney films they release them so you can't get snow white now and then in five years
time you snow white will come out and it'll be 24 euros for a thingy and then the following year
something else and something else but it should be it's supposed to be you're giving you're giving
these people a copy right so that they have the right to make copies but equally the public should
be able to avail of those and purchase them you would think you would indeed yes I would like to hear
people's comments on that views on that particular statement how it would work it's like
that there's a a law in Ireland that you know for public paths that if you put a public a right
way but you get a right way if the public are allowed to travel you know if the people are taking
a shortcut to your phone garden or something and if you if after a year and one day of walking
through your phone garden then it becomes automatically a public right away yes yes I've come
across this I'm not sure what the situation is in Scotland but it's somewhat similar England is
much more restrictive than my my understanding or was at least not sure now yeah but so yes
you're in a day of similar questions yeah okay following the bow thing the bow bow phone I should know
this you five or radio which let me hug me said clear I do not possess one of these because that
will be illegal and it's in the qsk ham radio episode and this was our good friend mr x coming
back again with a some other hidden features that he had found on his radio and I would love him
to do a whole episode on taking each of those words and functions and describing what it is
why you would need it to use that because I was screaming at the radio going oh this as he was
going through this is this and then it has this feature why do you need this feature and
no do that even for the basic on off stuff basically turning on a radio tuning into something
I love those especially as I'm getting into harm radio myself yes I I listened and thought
oh that sounds interesting but I was sort of filtering it out as a as a non-ham and thinking well
that's really for those guys but it would have been nice yeah to to have had a little bit more
introduction to for the naive like me yeah and also the the naive like me who has been do I've read
a lot of ham radio books in the last a few years because ever since I've announced I want to
become a ham radio enthusiast you know it is not enough for me to just learn the exam I want to
understand it hence it's taking a lot longer than I then I thought because I keep getting distracted
but only yes we love ham radio people so people come on get ham radio we need all our
almers just do the basic stuff as well the following day episode 2072 the awesome time I
deleted my home directly cyclop deletes are home directly only to recover one important file
who among us have not been there which of us has not experienced this yes yes I as a
rookie admin of a multi-user unique system oh yeah I have I have not quite done that but I have
done really really bad things like change the permission on the temp directory which causes
everybody to blow up because everybody uses temp why is this machine doing this weird thing
and the finger points at me oh sorry yes we've all been there also a very good tip for
how to recover it actually absolutely yes it's fascinating and platoon has a lot of
has some episodes I think on hpure related to basically getting rid of the rm command and replacing
it with a generic put it into a temp directory which kind of makes sense so yeah very good both
those of us who have not been there should should not stand on the sidelines and laugh we have this
thing in work when something like that happens you know you're required to buy tart for every team
that's been affected and you're not allowed to have a slice that seems quite just yes yes it's
well yeah unfortunately the lot of tart has been purchased over the time due to that
also I've had to buy a lot of tart over time as a result of that but it's it's it's quite good
everyone makes mistakes time amounting or jumping a lick comment by Frank I hope I never have to do
this but I'm glad to know what's possible yep and Brian follows with that I've had my best results
with test disk but I'm definitely going to play with this that's interesting I'm not
heard of that I think my son and I did a forensics thing on on a broken laptop of his using
photorec yeah which is a more generic you know look for anything that might be a file type of
thing and then you have to pick the bones out of that which is not easy but yeah this is much more
targeted and sophisticated I read a there is quite a few for recovering SD cards which can
actually be a lot easier because they on the SD card itself completely lies to the operating
system and actually doesn't delete it because it doesn't want to wear stuff out so your files will
happily be there and you can bypass all of that and even go down to the SD card and recover some
files from there and I remember somebody writing a script that will look for typical headers in
files so we'll look for the start of a jpeg photo header or a word document or whatever
and then scans through the files and it might not know where the file ends but it knows where it
starts so you'll have there might be two a jpeg file and a data file so you'll have the jpeg file
and then at the bottom it'll be a whole go of gobbly gook bottom yeah it's pretty good pretty
cool approach you can't remember what that was nice quite cool stuff I once wrote a thing to
recover broken magnetic tapes back in that that takes it all but yeah you already knew that but
I mean tapes all full of tape marks and and you know start of start of headers and stuff like that
so if you just wound forward till you hit something that was looked like something then you could
start determining if it was a file or what what the hell it was so yeah nice to happen lock
was taped with snap in tape read tape I know tape devices I got a lot of DV tapes here that are
completely I need to go through them again and try and recover them somewhere you know photo
video cameras dizzy oh yes so the following day we had GNU readline part one and never one to
disappoint Dave you introduce me to a few new ones that I didn't know but did you did you know
that you can do control home and control end and control you know they move one word back
as controlled right arrow did you know that I did well I will be knowing it because
probably part two or three will I think I said I didn't want to throw too many of these
out in one time because you know if you're listening to it you might be able to pick pick the the
odd one out and but if I could hit you with 50 of them you'll probably turn off way before I
didn't I didn't know about the control lump score either no neither did I do it doing this
controlling it's quite handy it's like the boss key controller yes if you're if you're doing all
your command line console stuff you know control out oh the screen just happened to clear
right there
anyway power of GNU readline experience with a neighborhood cat this show about a cat warning
repeat warning contains content that will be disturbing to some I I like these shows I don't
know obviously the story was but I liked Brian's approach actually I did yeah yeah to which I
applied this show is definitely of interest to hackers don't be afraid to share more now it's
it's it was a rough ride I thought but but still a worthwhile one to to follow him on and it was
yeah it was it was quite an affecting tale I think we're all a bit a bit scared of death I mean
I'm terrified of it because hey yeah what what what is this you know they were all right you're
going to go to hell forever yeah what's that the life of Brian aren't that Monty Python film where
they they go to Valhalla and the monk yes yes I'm opening the doors here remember that one I don't
know it's not the holy grail could it be the holy grail or something where all the Vikings were there
and they they're all experiencing the detours of death but there's one Christian monk among them
and he's gone yes yes yeah there's really doors here and I'm really opening the doors he's
opening the doors of Valhalla sorry sorry guys I will try and find a link to that and put
them to the show notes which I hate doing because now it means even more work anyway Frank said
you want to read that one oh sorry yes I was just writing down Monty Python to
to remind you while I read Frank one then okay Frank says so okay a tale of kindless
gentleness and truth especially the truth that we must accept death as being part of life as birth
this calls me to remember an experience we once had though the end was happier my wife and I were
going to visit my parents for Thanksgiving which is at the end of the November in the States thanks for
that and the youngest sister was watching the house sister allowed the cat to escape understand the
cat was detailed and most decidedly not an outside cat cat did not come back later on in the spring
across the street and they were called me over and there was Mittens curled up next to his chimney
and narrow shadow of her former self when I brought her back inside my wife's street and ran away
the poor thing looks so bad the happy ending was that she be cat fully recovered and
Ling lived long enough to tame the Labrador we got several years later so nice good good space yeah
yeah I'm sure many people have stories like that it's the most fascinating to hear though yeah
just thinking I mean I grew up in a farm and you yeah you have a responsibility to animals
but they're not pets they're you know they're they're animals but at the same time there is the
the husbandry element of of animal husbandry and I remember when times are off on the farm you know
and my mother would spend would spend the profit for the year going to the vet to to you know have a
calf or a cow taking care of and I never really understood that from a profit and loss point of
view but now being more mature I think I understand that from a human point of view yes yes yes
there is an ethical requirement to do these things I think yeah but there's also a certain point
where you go okay this is it and I also think myself as a here we have a euthanasia is legal in
the Netherlands it has to be done approved by three independent doctors and my mother-in-law passed
that way she had terminal cancer and was you know looking at two years of extended you know life
extending stuff and then she had she had that happen and it was in her own house and all her
kids were around her and stuff and it was a yeah nice way to go to be honest yes yes it is I can
kind of answer that and I understand a lot of people will be screaming at the
microphone for her now at me for approving of this and you're perfectly entitled here on
opinion and I do apologize if that in any way brings up sad experiences for you or whatever but
in in that case it was it was a choice that they had and they met it and they're comfortable with
okay good I'm more cheerful things episode 2075 skin cancer a recent experience with
sin skin cancer and a primer on UV tintor oil who is not a doctor just so that we know when
give some very very good advice this is this is definitely 100% of interest to hackers and
went through how he had the Australian BOM what does this
ring skin cancer there was an imaging technique that he was describing where you take photos of
your body and you compare growths over time and you found one of these and his GP was able to
take care of it in a few days so very good stuff and absolutely of interest hackers we need to
group these somehow yeah tags yeah yeah but yeah medicine sort of a medical tag or something
of that sort of life this yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's very cool I've been to Australia and one of
the guys I stayed with had just come back from having a melanoma removed because because of that
very you know it was just early stages and they can be operated on my my mother had one as well
because she used to love to sit out in the sun all day long and used to say should you not be wearing
some hat or you know but she didn't and then she got a melanoma it was removed and nothing came
with it so it's very good to catch and catch them early getting at it in time that's the thing
you go straight down my wife had their had one and she just went down had a look at it and turned
out to be nothing so fine so great yes and always yeah better better safe than sorry I say but then
again I don't have to pay for visits to the doctor so well I do help insurance but I can just go
down as often as I like the following day magazines that I read Linux voice Linux format micro
mart raspberry pie the magpie full circle magazine and pc linux os mag this is another show by
tonnews and I read two of those yeah me to actually three occasionally read full circle it's
yeah it's you can be on an rss feed to get it that way yeah yeah great idea for a show
like this yeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely magpie is something I've not been reading and listening
to Tony talking about it really should because it sounds to be very full of good stuff what I've
done is I print them off and work on a you know on the color printer on double sided so
four four sheets and then stipple them together and just leave them in the at the sort of
coffee area on our floor and yeah people come up and they read it and the amount of people who
have asked me for oh did you put the magpie or the thingy there and I just give them a raspberry pie
then to to try stuff out and it's one of the most red magazines on the floor it's so that's
pretty cool thing very cool I like the sound of that yeah yeah oh and a plug for linux voice I
was having a little drink with the certain podcasters I'm fighting including one of the linux voice
uh editori team how cool Andrew um Gregory yep yeah there's a cool guy and it's prepared to come
to glass go to I could not afford that day if I really could be a show you couldn't yeah we would
have liked to see you there but yeah it's a long haul yeah I'm I'm thinking for for three days
of camp I can I can justify that but uh and also I am I was never really into pub crawls I
I'm more I go to the corner and have a chat and then start singing sort of go-missile
yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm a lightweight and I I'm bad after pub number two
about three hours I think it was no that's not too bad no no no it was it was it was good don't
we had a had a really good evening I haven't heard the what happened to everybody after I left but
sure the the story will come out in due course as an HPR show I believe very good yes that's why
I'm not going to be asking you any more questions away liberaniel dot net self-holsting for friends
and family a talk I talk a little about my network and how I can hold services for in your friends
and family excellent idea I'm very happy that he does that and if he wants if you want to this
Christopher M Hobbes of course and Christopher I'm happy to donate a server a Raspberry Pi to this
that I put here on my network if you want to however I do not do any of this stuff because as soon
as you go on holidays the first thing that happens is your network falls over which is why I outsource
my networking to some ex colleague who is far better at us than me yes yes now I thought it was a
great great great show and a very interesting thing to be doing and there's a lot of information
in that show too I made the note to go back and listen to it again I haven't done so yet
just to get a you know full picture of what Christopher was talking about there yeah very cool
the open wireless dog I have that here on my on my Wi-Fi I just have open wireless dog available
and which is cool thing go have a look at that as all if you haven't had a chance
and then all of these thing all of these services will be interesting to have a show about Christopher
how you set those up and what what you do the most interesting one I think will be the DNS
because in this day and age of monitoring and all sorts of interesting thing you know
monitoring and metadata would be interesting to be able to make sure that that is coming out
in different places and that you're able to manage your own DNS services but there you go very
cool mail servers again mail is one of the most federated things you dev you random dot info
you random dash podcast dot org is it they also did a quite a thing about federation they could
also do with an email address on their feed by the way so the next day 2078 dev can you put in
the show notes to put a link to that you you random podcasts from Poké and X110 and Taj what's
in my bag choice summary of the crap window go logs back and forth stainless steel coffee mug stainless
steel thermos uh canteen one foot micro usb one and a half foot micro usb cable ethernet cable
sony headphones sd usb 64 gig primary on the keychain magnifies ballpoint pen lunch mason jar
metal box backup drive tell mini nine with AC adapter and uh a zerisen uh very a lack
verix laptop with an AC adapter first point i'd like to say is you don't get dehydrated from drinking
coffee theoretically you do but it is so minuscule the any effects that you get from
being dehydrated with coffee are made up from the liquid water that's in the coffee that you're
drinking so you would need to drink thousands upon thousands of cups of coffee without water in
order to get actually i'm not sure about that last time but i know that the that's a you can't
get dehydrated from drinking coffee so but just drink water as well have you gone Dave sorry sorry
i was just writing things um yeah it's i like this show and um uh we need to go with sort of
slightly apologetic that he was doing this off the cuff well oh yeah do more do more like that
please because you did a brilliant job of absolutely a natural speaker really nicely nicely put together
so yeah yeah and they uh i like the idea of having the 64 gigabyte drives yes we do live in the
future having all these devices there it's absolutely absolutely awesome i have a little usb thing
with a that are put in a sd card and right here it's tiny but it's amazing actually uh 64 gigs
just going around on your keychain it's awesome it's just unbelievable i believe we live in the future
no no i was just about to reminisce and that's what all people do so i should check out
no dude this is this is hbr this is what i actually you like shut up and do a show bottle thank you very
much it's coming it's coming i'm gonna do another one of my life history in in computing thingies at
some point uh fairly soon so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now let's just add it to your initial i'm like
maybe i've like beat reduce you say you say it three times in your initial and up pops can yeah
where can his finger uh good mini nine ha our old mini nine is still kicking her good to hear it's
still been put to good use to which windiggle said in the voice of Dave my favorite not only
still kicking but it's been my primary machine for the past three years while traveling in fact i'm
typing on it right now because it was in my bag how meta pretty pretty cool pretty cool everybody loves
asset house apparently according to singflop who demonstrates how to get asset house quickly
she uses techno box two and simulates a tb 303 is there on a tb 30 tb 803 tr 803 is there anything
this woman can't do she she's a brilliant programmer she's an artist of her pictures that she
she sent to me are amazing and now she's into techno music seriously on the other hand
she has her own issues as well so yeah but this is a good episode this is fascinating i'd love to hear
how music is put together i can't say i actually understand what asset house is but it's probably
just a case of googling the answer but oh my god my son is
slender or nothing no i haven't i haven't lived with my son who had or
nothing nothing like this but lots of music production things on these mac mac book you know so
so dad listen to this you know so yeah yeah it's very nice but no i prefer a bit of bark myself
but no no i actually enjoy all manner of types of music but yeah this is not a genre that i
have sort of singled out particularly but you know so it's the first time for some reason the
the Netherlands is big into electronic music and i think the reason was and again you random
come come up with this link where philips in eindhoven did a loss to promote electronic music
so that could be why electronic music is very very big in the neverlands oh that's cool
my my kids my son being very much into music uh i'd we'd started on doing a holiday many years ago
and i said where do you want to go you said Berlin why Berlin well that's the the home of trance
and dance and all that stuff and we got there and it was the last example of the love parade
techno music thingy on in Berlin at that on that very day oh very cool yeah yeah we didn't
pile into it because they were young they were too young to go in and and and sort of be
lost in there in the vast crowd but we went home and watched it on the telly and went into the hotel
and watched it on the telly so they were broadcasting it simultaneously on the television so yeah
i think we all had a great great day just sitting in the hotel watching that
so now in the next day was kiddie in live effects and transitions the massive massive amount of
work by Geddes to convert these to audio and i love i love this i love the fact that kiddie in live
this series of articles is absolutely excellent because it just allows me to go into
kiddie in live and go okay i know this can do this and i refer back to this series
and find out how to do stuff and Geddes is doing a really good job on translating these to audio
for us which is very very professional finish he's he's he's producing there it's really good
unbelievable yeah absolutely speaking of from professional to ultimus hacking fixing my daughter's
laptop my daughter broke the headphone jack in her laptop and i tried to get the remains out
this is oh dave dave dave dave dave dave did you have something underneath
the laptop in case it fell out of the workman oh you did you had a yeah yeah yeah the chair
says says i stood it on a chair which just happened to be the right height to hold it up oh yeah god
yes if if it fallen down smashed while she was out i'd have been killed and murdered and the question
is why didn't you just take it apart and you know unscrew the thing and just get to the socket
well you can't because it's a it's a closed unit i mean you can get right down to the motherboard
that's that that's not a trivial exercise the motherboards about the last bit you get to after you
been all the way through the the keyboard and everything else so i look through the disassembly manual
to work out if it was possible and then when you get there it's a completely closed thing
you'd have to desolder it and put a new one in because you can't poke the the the bit of
plug out not like jack plugs used to be in the you could just look inside i had a real
real tape recorder with with plugs on and i did do that um and you know open the the inside wow
it's fascinated what was inside it you know um but uh but not this one no no way
yeah i'm getting more and more envious of the tools and stuff you have in your house
oh right yeah just having a look although you're a washer needs to be changed too
oh there's the tumble dry yeah yeah still needs a bit of this hadn't been emptied yet
yeah yeah you you don't see the rest of the crap in the in the house i was i cropped off the
the the revelation of Dave's house of crap but uh but you notice i've got a vi oh yeah there's a
vice bolted to the kitchen table and that's they're all the time you know so seriously go
yeah it is i think i never remember to take it off again it's just a clamp on the vice
but it's just useful to have body in the way i have one right here but that's under my work bench
what so you laugh what what you don't have a vice in your kitchen
yeah yeah yeah spot the battery yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay next um we had a comment by
0 X f 1 0 e nice work with a smiley face yes it is and there is an amazing amount of joy to be
had by you know doing a hack like that and then actually works but it could have gone wrong
It could have gone badly wrong Dave. I know I know I started off thinking well
Should I take some pictures of it might manage to make you show up this but what if it goes wrong? All right
Well nothing ever happened
Well, I'm more thinking about did you take a backup?
Of the laptop
No
Who needs a backup of a laptop?
You know when you're working with it with a drill that could generate heat that could start a fire within the laptop
Yeah, no, no, I'm a I'm a I'm a craftsman. I'll happy
Yeah, you can see I can see that it's the vice attached to the kitchen table that gives it away a day
Okay, next day basic audio production by Natu Jordy and
Odacity order and talks about
The compression and this is equalization. Yeah, just listen to it just today and
He's saying that he might not be able to continue this series, but that's absolutely fine. Allow somebody else
Audio production is a good series to have so if anyone else wants to
jump into the frame feel free to do so and
Two things they're actually one on that is any of the series that are marked public not specifically private
Then you can contribute to them and when in doubt just ask the the primary primary host who started the series
Or ask us and the second one Dave to your comment about if it fails do not be afraid to put on shows that failed
For example, my bills are oscilloscope kit that didn't finish was one of the most entertaining episodes and
From my point of view when you do get it working. I'll have another show
So all the better and fail multiple times
Yes, yes, absolutely. It's I would agree with that actually
Because I think people are too hung up and everything being absolutely perfect, but I'm I'm also quite interested in
How things fail is you know, you try something in a dozen workouts well, then you just save somebody that amount of time
So it's a learning experience indeed. Yeah, exactly just me
18th HBO beer podcast in the beverage issue and this time it was a
Imperial IPA flying dog single hop warrior Imperial IPA if you're gonna name it you should really name it I
Don't like IPA is per se so there you go
I'm a fan. I'd quite like to try something like that and yeah
I thought we had this rule that you were gonna have to send us a bottle just so that we could confirm
I distinctly distinctly remember not being sent one so
Not happy about this
Although that might be a bad idea
Cleaning the throttle body of on my pickup truck and a really I'm so glad young got this
This vehicle because we're getting so many shows
hollered as the thing breaks in multiple ways. I laugh while I have owned vehicles where
Base yeah driving down the road and the front wheel falls off and
Yeah, you have to replace the whole the whole housing and stuff
So there he I don't think you got this one fixed in the in the episode but
Poki replied in email on an email thread
Do you have that right there in front you Dave hold on a second
It was in total John Culp's truck. Are you talking about? Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Poki says or Patrick daily as he puts himself in the email is says John
If you're rough idle symptoms persist it may be a stuck EGR valve the idle air control I see valve or a coolant temperature sensor
CTS
So shall I read all of this? Yeah, please do yeah, yeah, okay
Cleaning or replacing the EGR may do the trick
There may be a way to test the IAC and the CTS with the scan tool often the parts stores have those to lend out
I'm not sure if the Bluetooth OBD2 test as somebody did a show about that recently
Yeah, I'm performing diagnostic tests, but it's worth a shot if you have one
If it's none of those things then it may be a vacuum leak
Or worn out plug-wise a vacuum leak can be found by listening for a hiss
Then spraying the area with your throttle body cleaner if the idle smooths out while you're spraying then you found a leak
Just don't spray too much at once. It's highly flammable and
The engine and engines are hot. So from the exhaust with it
Yeah
This could be quite amusing
Vacuum leaks can come from cracked or disconnected vacuum hoses don't mess with the mass air blows sensor
Except as a last resort. They are very sensitive and often fragile devices
So because it happens after driving for a while I'd start with the EGR valve and the coolant temperature sensor
Some cars have EGRs that just get dirty and stick open and cleaning them fixes the problem
Other cars have EGRs with weak solenoids and need to be replaced
A little research will probably tell you which is more likely for you
The throttle body cleaning was a good start and you probably did a good enough job to eliminate it
The butterfly and side passages are the most important
Those got cleaned then you're done there dirty clean and walls are relatively unimportant
You may wish to pull the IAT and clean it and its passages
Wow, complex, eh? You could also look to see if there's an adjustment procedure for your throttle position sensor
Bad plug wires can be diagnosed by misting them with water from a spritzer bottle in a dark and garage
Or in the evening if you see little blue sparks and it's time to change the wires
Be sure to do them one at a time so you don't mix them up
If you change wires do plugs cap and rotor if you have them too
The last thing I can think of is dirty fuel injectors are not atomizing fuel properly
Sadly, I don't know if a cheap DRA remedy for that or diagnosis for that matter
Black smoke even very faint from the tailpipe the car dies would hit at injectors
The IAC or a faulty coolant temperature sensor
Let's have a look let us know how it turns out
Wow, that's a manual in itself that is that's amazing
That is a show and did we know that Patrick Daly was an expert in automotive vehicles
No, each of those paragraphs is a show right there, wouldn't you think Dave?
Absolutely, my best son, my best son, what's it used?
What's I layer control valve? It's its use
A year
Yes, I have to say that in listening to John show I was thinking what an earth is a throttle body
I did use I have done engine maintenance but in the days of carburetors
Yeah, nothing of fuel injections
And so I was reading about it and the whole business of cleaning and stuff
And there's so much
Yes
As Poki was was alluding to us so much so many senses so many controls
You know, it's a hell of a thing but to if you can master it then good for you tell us about it
Exactly
John replied to Patrick, thanks so much for the detailed feedback
I'm going to save this for future reference
Great to get this analysis from somebody with your level experience
I'm glad to report that the truck has been doing just fine
Since the throttle body cleaning so I'm considering it solved for the moment
Yes, excellent
And the final show for this month was pengukan 2016 report
A nice chilled out relaxed walkthrough of what pengukan is
And hookah's experience of it
Very nice
Yes, yes, I like these from from a hookah
Sound like a hell of a conference
So it's a tremendously interesting stuff
Funny how all the different consequences have different fields to them
That's kind of yes
Yes, strange that the conference with stuff about insect electrophysiology
is that's not a thing I would have expected at all
Yeah, I was thinking about that
Yeah, don't worry about it, you'll grow back a leg
But you might be bloody sore right now
I don't feel pain
No, they don't feel pain
Caron teeth, no, no, no
They've never told me don't want to feel pain, feel pain
Amazing that, no
Yes
Some other comments
Mr X
And I'm presuming seen as this is posted on the 7th
The third of this month we didn't cover it in last month's show
I'm guessing
And so yeah, yeah, we should have, we should have
We said we were going to try and rationalize this a bit
Yeah, for this episode
But I have no
No, duct tape and chips
No, duct tape
No, the chips are definitely down
This is the first one where Mr X did a show
And Mike Ray had asked, does it talk out of the box
And yes, it talks out of the box
Playing with the radio I noticed that not all functions are spoken
The band function button for example
Which changes from VHF to UHF function only beeps
But you can go to any frequency directly at any time
When in the VFO mode
Which is spoken
And you can type the frequency directly
The VFO AB is the same
But again, the same applies
Would imagine and make an excellent radio for the blind up
Wouldn't go too far around with the price
What does VFO mode?
What's VHF, UHF?
What's VFO AB?
All shows Mr X
Ah, Mr X follows up in comment
Three, saying just read your comment above
Again and realize that I haven't properly answered your question
Yes, most if not all of the menus are spoken
When you push the menu button it announces menu
And then shows you on the display which option is selected
You can find out which option is being displayed
By pushing the menu button the second time
You would then push exit
To change to another menu option
You can either use the up down keys
Or use keypad entry
Which is which unfortunately only beeps within the menu option
However again, you can find out what option you are in
By pushing menu a second time
Hope this isn't too confusing
And I still think a blind operator could use it fine
Particularly if you upload a pile of frequencies to it
Using the open source chirps on the way
Hmm, also another show there, thank you
And the only other comment are that we haven't spoken about already was
Test driving to the one
Ah, I got this wrong last month as well
By Frank Bell
And that is the Debian version without system D
And crayon says slim
For your information slim simple login manager
Should allow you to cycle through the available DMs
Which is display managers by pressing the F1 key
You simply stop at the desired DM
And then login slim config
Within ETC somewhere for example ETC slim
Or ETC slim for such slim.com probably
Can be used to define your choices
Never heard about that one. Thanks crayon
Yeah, that's good
And I think we've covered all the other comments on today's show
Due to the slides
Yep, so yep
Yep, so I think we can use our brains
Rather than having to rewrite that
Was there anything else on the mailing list, David?
Well, we've had a problem with the mailing list for the notes
Yeah, Jay emailed you about
But just to explain to anybody listening
I make these notes by parsing stuff off the G-Main website
And the site's down at the moment
It was when I checked it to an hour or so back
So we'll have to fill them in later
But yes, there is an amount of stuff on the
That was talked about on the list
Okay
And I'm just you've got
Yeah, I'm just going to call it up here in an hour
In a second, let me see
So I mentioned about that the guys had a
not-friendly computing device
And crowd supply and EORMA68
And the reason I put this on the list was because
I did an interview with Hema Fostem
And I completely lost the interview
It was so, so annoying
Because it was a very, very interesting project
I don't
Very technical guy, but he has
It's hard to get an idea of what he's trying to do
So I don't know if you know the old
Pop-in PCI MCIA cards from days of year
Remember those as you buy
You can get a laptop and you could extend it
With one of those that you put an additional
letter card or a modem or something
And you know, there were the hackable things of the day
You plug them in, you take them out
And you've got
You've got
You could have a modem or you could have a camera
Or you could have other all sorts of things on them
Now those form factors
So this guy was sitting down thinking about
Okay, I want to make portable computing devices
And he was saying that
These are going to use standard components
And this is a standard component
It's been mass-manufactured
All the dies and all the equipment
And all the machinery necessary to do that
Still exists
There's still in large quantities
Available out there
And they're cheap
So then they've got all
Something like 64 connectors at the back
So he's going to dedicate certain number of connectors
To HDMI, certain number of connectors
To HD USB, certain number of connectors
To GPIO, etc, etc, etc
And certain number to power
With me so far, Dave
Yep
Those connectors are
By definition within the standard
So he's saying this is the standard
For a computing device
For making a small computer
So you have a laptop case or a computer or a digital camera
And you can your PCIe MCIA
Formatted device
Is your computing device
So you can slip it into a mobile phone
And your mobile phone now is your computing device
You can put it into the back of a TV
And your TV is now your computing device
You take it out, you put it into your laptop case
And your laptop is your computing device
So essentially you walk around with this thing
And if you get a newer one for your laptop
You can take the older one and put it into your camera
And you can do a daisy chain down
They're all going to be backward compatible
So as a newer version of the USB becomes available
It needs to be backward compatible
Right down to USB 2
Hitch, same with Hitch, HDMI, 1.4, 1.3
The whole way back down
So the device will always fail
Even if you're running a newer version
Of this device on an older software
It will, it is required to fail gracefully back
They're not sharing any of the eye opens
So that there's no confusion with the hardware
That in this implementation it's this
It's in that implementation it's that
It's clearly defined in the specification
So that there's no disambiguity
Sounds like a absolutely awesome device
Because as I said to him during the interview
Which died
You could get an aluminium laptop case
Designed for yourself
Exactly how you want to spend
For a grand on that
And know that you will never ever need
To update it again because you can
To update your computer
You just update the
Slip out that standard device, slip it back in
Maybe you want to change the screen
But the size of the screen, the laptop
Everything to do with the laptop
Could be custom designed for you and hackable and updateable
Pretty awesome device
Does sound impressive
Yeah, yeah, it's a great idea
Yeah, similar to
That idea has been kicked around in science fiction
Yeah, it's actually, but it's coming to reality
This is
I think what they actually need is a good marketing team
To give the essence of what they're trying to do first
Without the technical stuff
It was grand for the learning sling tech show
I mean the audience here and there
Are more than capable of of understanding what he's on about
But you know the need one of these
You know green eco things
With lots of
Flying in butterflies and stuff
To sell this concept to the average person
Because it's I think it is
A cleaner implementation of the
What they were trying to do with the
Fairphone and failed
Due to the fact that the hardware was not open
And that the software
Therefore could not be open
And therefore you bought a device
Thinking you could upgrade it but you can't
Because it's locked down
So yeah, pretty cool thing
And yeah, technically the specs met a
Nor for a lot of sense
So, you know, I was kicking myself that I lost that
Yeah, I've not heard the TLLTS
episode yes
The deadly 666
Still in my queue, right?
But yeah, I'm looking forward to that then
The audio is terrible quality audio
So if you can struggle to
I need to
I need to have another word
Oh, we had a lot of updates on the
Contributors map of the world
So we found out what that was
So that that was an idea by
Let me see
Who was it started it off
I think it was Clinton
Clinton right?
Yes, yes
Brilliant idea
And we put if you go to mapm.net
Which I hope is there on my pm.net
You will map map
Not my name
Mapm.net
You will guess
Three people on the website
So quite
Quite simple thing
And then you click on the link
And you get to the correspondent and their
Their shows
And so pretty cool
I think we can do that
And I want to know if that's
People can reply on
That's something that you want to put in
Or should I just put
That as two fields on today
On to the host page
From your uploader show
What do you think it is
Well, I think it's a nice idea
Personally, I
Well, as you know
I've contributed my
details so
I'm more than happy to
To be part of that
And I think it would be a really good thing
It was interesting to see
Where Clinton Roy is
Spaces for example
Yeah, yeah
Pretty cool
I didn't even know he was over in the part of the old world
And you're up in the sticks of Edinburgh, Dave
Far far away in the North
Yes, yes, yes
On the best room
I see, I think
Kevin Years would win that particular
Thanks, so yes, yeah, yeah
So did we have anything else
That month
Let me see
Hitchcock on the world
Yep
There was a bit of chitchat
About the community news
Coming up
Recording yesterday that didn't happen
Yeah, that's all really
That's life, basically
All right, anything else that you want to share with us
So we got to hang over
I did pretty well actually
Yeah, yeah, it was fun
It's a good thing to
Meet up with the guys
And there were seven of us this time
At one point, anyway
So as opposed to four last year
So some of the people who
Seemed to be
Better to come never
Never did
For various reasons
So yeah
Yes, you know, people like
Saying, oh, I live in a different country
I don't know how am I going to get there
Exactly
This is the kind of price of a
Let me just waste the price of a laptop
For an evening's drink
For a little
Totally reasonable
Still, yeah
Given that I got there for free
Because I get
I got a bus cab
It's you that's been
Scripping off this economy
That's why we've got the recession
Oh, I know, I know, I know
All my fault
I drank your beer too
So there you go
Yeah
All right, Steve
Let's call it a wrap
And tune in tomorrow for another exciting episode of
Hacker
Public
Riding you
Join us
No, I'm jealous of you
You'll be free
Okay
That's the death metal version
Thank you very much
Yes
