Today's show is entitled The Hope Conference.
It is hosted by Murph and is about one minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.

Hackers on Planet Earth.
Now it's an annual conference inspired by and put on by the folks behind 2600 magazine.

workshops, demonstrations, vintage computers, ham radio, and a wide variety of topics that
would be of interest to hackers.
