Hi my name is Dave the Loveburg and welcome to another exciting possibly episode of Hacker
Public Radio. What you're about to hear is just showing a 50 minutes of a combination of
soundscape random netter and a concerted effort to find something we've never seen in a place
we've never been. I hope you find it both useful and enjoyable into the woods we go.
Oh how much miles how much was 0.14
Hi everyone my name is Dave the Loveburg and as you can probably hear we're out in the open.
We're at Saddlebeek Park in Donkasta and we thought we thought we'd take the advantage of
the bank holiday Monday of being such a gorgeous day 28 degrees and if I take part in this
does this mean that it's my I'm conjured my first HPR? You're contributing to your first HPR
but you won't be your first because I'll be happy. Please watch where you're going named.
HNHNHNHN I'll be my name here how very do I. Well you haven't gotten accounts so anyway
No we have no video meant recording so part of what we're doing as well as getting some vitamin D
and some fresh air and probably getting burned as well is we're geocaching and that is
what I want to talk about today. So geocaching, it is a game, it's basically what it is, it is a game.
And a challenge?
It's a pastime, not the same as a game? No, a pastime doesn't have to be a game, does it?
But a game is typically a pastime. And it is a challenge.
How can it help you pass the time? Oh well done, thanks for that insight.
Oh good job card to see it. So the idea of geocaching is that someone has put a thing somewhere that you need to go and find.
Now typically this thing is a container of some sort. Now the container can be tiny about the size of a pen or it can be clever.
It can be clever. Yes, a snail or a little. It could be disguised as a leaf but it's still a container.
Or it could be as big as a one litre top of a top of a box.
Or a treasure chest? Yes, we did. We found an army treasure chest.
Also we found there wasn't in a container.
So you use an app provided by geocaching or you can use one of the third party apps.
We use CGO because it's nicer to use and it's better.
So we are currently on a search for a cache called Saddlebeat Part 1 cache 3 Samson's Stash,
which according to my app is 367 feet away.
So we're not far away. We're walking at a slow pace towards it.
And Alex is going to help us find this one.
Yay!
I will find it on my own.
The last one was a little bit downhill and a bit more difficult to find.
I will find it on my own. It's a micro cache.
Well the last one was literally downhill.
It's a micro cache.
What this one is, is it a micro cache?
It is a micro cache, you're absolutely right.
I have to find it all on my own.
Yeah, you're going to find it mate.
This one was a bigger one but it had to get changed from the school to the original.
Yeah, this is the problem with geocaching.
The idea is that your cache is trying to find a hidden.
Now they're often hidden in plain sight but it's such a way where somebody who's not playing the game
won't necessarily find it.
But unfortunately sometimes they do get muggled, which is the official term of something
getting discovered by someone who's not playing geocaching.
And in this case it was stolen.
Which is really sad because the cache was actually put down in memory of the cache owners dog
who died a couple of days previously.
So really cheery but also very, very sad that somebody thought it was nice to come along.
Steal this item and well we don't know what they do with it.
Nope.
Stole it destroyed it.
140 feet, we're still, we haven't gone past it, we haven't missed it.
We have come to a down and up bit.
We have?
I wouldn't go across the log, I don't think the log would actually...
When she's saying log people, it's like a trap.
Yeah, it's a twig.
Alright, come on out.
I'm not going to go that way.
No, you're not going to cross the same way as we are.
It certainly wouldn't hold my way, that's a fact.
Right, so it looks as though we keep going in that direction.
Oh, hello?
Oh, it's bad.
Yeah, and there's literally a long side of the railway line.
Well, I don't know, we may not get that far.
45 feet, 38 feet.
It's going to be in this ditch, isn't it?
Yeah.
Which hopefully is a ditch, not a very thick leveled river.
15 feet, it's going to be on this side, isn't it?
Please note that I have this unique road in the school game.
Yum.
Well, that's lunch sorted.
So it's...
Everybody put the bed here.
We're going down here.
I don't think we need spiders.
Hang on, I've got a spider nest around me.
I like spider.
A spider web around my beard.
Are we going down here?
I don't think we need to.
We're 7 feet.
It said behind the tweet, isn't it?
It said the clue was behind the tree.
So it's probably years down there then.
I hold back.
Yeah, that's close.
Sorry.
Right, Caroline's got the corner.
Wait a minute, let me go first.
So what's happening is because that little boy is only six.
I'm very adventurous.
Dave's just trying to help him so he doesn't do himself an injury.
Well done.
But we're going to now let him look for it.
So it'll be a micro cache.
Which means it'll be small.
Hang on, don't start grabbing your things.
Now what happens with deal cache when you're doing this?
We'll just be looking at it out for muggles.
So not to make it obvious to other people,
what they are in case you get more people stealing things.
What if it's too far out to look at those trees?
No.
It says behind the tree.
Oh no, it's right, I've got a torch in there.
We can go behind that.
The torch is out now.
We're getting serious.
Serious business.
It's not metal, that's slug trails, mate.
There is a tree up here.
Behind that guy around just in case.
We're now looking for that's a tree.
And it's over there, mate.
There's a gap in there, Dave.
In where?
I've looked in there.
Alright, you're looking in there.
No.
This is the bit where...
You start to think, oh, where's it gone?
Oh!
That's why there are trails.
There's family slugs here.
They're nice.
Maybe the family slugs are resting on the cache.
We would not disturb them.
No.
I'd...
Have someone check the history for logs?
Yes, see.
I am on it.
Yes.
Someone said this is still there, but needs a new wire.
Please replace carefully, I've ordered a new one.
Why are these?
Why are these?
Now that's interesting.
And there's an image.
Of course, if it's wire, then it may well be suspended from something.
So I wonder if it's over by that fence.
What feet are we on from where we are at the moment?
You don't want my device, my device.
Nine feet.
So it could be over here?
No, no.
It's not really.
You've got me in the back.
It could be out.
It could fall out.
So there is a tree.
Ah, Dave.
Can you see the tree it's talking about?
Yeah, look at...
Scooby-peek while this is where we're doing the technical bit.
There is a bit where it shows you a picture.
But it looks like a paler tree, which I would imagine is that one behind you where Alex was looking.
Because it's paler than this one.
We're comparing tree barks now to see which one's the most likely.
I think it's that one behind you, Dave.
This one.
Well, what happened?
Yeah.
You said I'm finding it.
You said I'm finding it.
Can I come down and find it?
I'm not seeing the markings.
So this just shows you it's not easy.
Go down if you want Clara.
It's not easy.
It's not meant to be simple to do.
It's got to be a challenge.
Is it dangling from a height or lower down or...?
No, it's attached around a pole or a branch.
Oh.
I did ask Clara to look at that one.
But again, I'm not seeing the markings on it.
There are markings on this tree.
Looks like a huge chunk of bark has been taken.
That noise you just heard.
What about that one over there then?
I'm holding cars fun.
Because one of the pictures below that had a funny chunky bit of...
I'm not seeing the single branch coming out of this one.
I'm finding it.
There's a single branch higher up.
Well, I say higher up.
But didn't say bottom of tree.
I don't know if they said bottom of tree.
Behind the tree.
Behind the tree.
I mean, there's some more trees higher up.
That bottom photograph is taken in that direction.
Right.
It's a lot way there.
So, we've now got lots of people with different decisions
and different ideas of where it might be.
But this is the one where, if it's a microcash, it's really small.
It's not easy to locate due to the size of it generally.
Difficult to find.
I'm just going to go off an attendant now just in case the satellite coordination's off
to see whether I can see any other options.
So, because sometimes the GPS is a little bit off.
So, when it sits a few feet, it's actually not quite as close as that and it's a bit further down.
So, I'm coming from a different angle now to see whether I can find it in case of the description was off.
But interestingly, this is like yuk, sludgy, pudgy.
Hello.
I said I was just coming from a different angle to see.
That's a birch.
That is a birch.
It says behind tree, doesn't it?
I'm behind a tree down here.
I don't think that that is it.
No, that's just a bit of a...
If I find it, I'll let you know.
And you can do the bit.
And help it out.
If you go further.
So, yes.
This is actually probably a good way of showing you how sometimes you can be so sure you're on the right track and then it all goes a bit wrong.
I have no idea what I am as well because this is like underneath a tunnel, which is really weird.
There is actually a tunnel here, which is weird, but it's like half the height.
Oh, Alex, you're right.
Really?
Alex, don't step on things, mate.
Alex just stood on a twig that really came up into his face.
Yeah.
How was it?
All right.
I've got you.
Alex, look under there.
There's a tunnel.
I won't go in it, but it goes all the way to the end.
Right.
Alex, look at the back of this because you'll get in a bit more than me.
You and Alex have a look.
Don't put your hands in gaps so you don't see things, Alex.
It's really scary.
Alex, don't stand on things.
I'm probably snowing.
He won't be that far round, Alex.
I know we're not going to stand on things.
I can't help it.
Yeah, my husband's saying don't stand on things, but when the whole ground is lots of different twigs,
it's very difficult not to stand on things.
It's not that far, Alex.
So...
We might have to meet to feed this one.
It knows in a nice spot.
Yeah, just be careful, Alex.
Yeah, this, my dear people, maybe what is known as a DNS.
Did not find.
I'm having a quick look to see.
A second pair of eyes on the bits that they've checked.
Just in case.
But Carr is usually really be-be-de-eyed on these kind of things.
And finds things quickly and easily.
That is a compliment, dear.
I can see something under here.
What can you see?
Beam.
That's a slug, mate.
I'm back, mate.
Yeah.
The rule is, Alex, unless you can see what you're looking at, don't put your-
What is that there?
Why is this going this way?
Hold on.
I'll come with you, Father.
I'll come with you.
I've got a tweak here with a funny-looking coloured thing.
And it is literally a gap.
There is no dangling wire in anything.
So there you go.
Experience first-hand.
Have some time to just don't find what you're looking for.
I think it's like a squirrel, a little squirrel.
Do your question, by the way, can be quite-
He's lost.
It's worth it, though.
It's worth it.
But now comes the challenge of getting up.
I've got a bit of Alex now helping you up, so...
No.
I don't need you.
So, this looks like it's going to be our first notch find of the day.
I know, but I'm not mind if the holiday.
Yep.
So I'm going to give you today so I can get up.
Hold on.
I love it, I love it.
Right.
Okay.
What I'm going to do,
so I'm going to pause this here
and when we get closer to the next one,
we'll have another look.
One male little.
So we're about 400 feet from the next cache.
Really gutted.
Alex is just showing off his muscles.
Alex is showing off his muscles.
Right.
Really gutted we had to
did not find that last one.
Yeah, it was too sneaky.
Hmm.
It was sneaky.
It was either very well hidden
or very badly hidden.
What if someone...
What if someone...
What if someone actually saw it again?
The might have done, I suppose.
It's possible.
But someone did find it a few days ago.
In fact...
In fact, the cache owner owner
found it a few days ago
and said it was there.
It was a cache owner.
Yes, the cache owner.
Well, well, if he got...
Well, if he got um...
stolen the day after.
It could get?
Oh, stolen the day after.
Ooh, stingy nettle central.
Do you want to go in front of me mate?
No.
Well, back to the scratchy recording daddy.
You are recording.
You've been recording this whole time.
You've been recording this whole time.
No.
Daddy, now you're just walking through
in that field.
Probably daddy.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It is a beautiful day.
We're actually out in the open now.
We're not in the trees.
Alex, if you keep your hands to yourself mate,
you won't get stung by stingy nettles.
Stingy nettles.
But this sun is like Uber warm.
It's like 28 degrees centigrade.
Sorry, it sells this.
What's 28 Celsius in Fahrenheit?
No.
No.
Hot.
What is 28 Celsius in Fahrenheit?
28 degrees Celsius equal 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
There you go.
Hot.
No daddy.
Oh, hold your horses.
Back up.
No.
Back up.
No.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Yeah, keep going.
I don't want to go in the head.
I don't want to go in the head.
Let me go and see.
There is a trodden path.
Right, less than 100 feet.
We found a trodden path.
Oh, oh.
Oh, I say.
Hey, what can we do over here?
Well, there is a nice expression
of political temperature here in the
United Kingdom at the moment where
basically we're outside this red brick building
and someone has decided to write the words
Brexit can go fornicate itself.
Yeah, we know what it says Alex.
We don't have to take it out there.
Oh, hang on.
No, it's not out there.
It's not in there.
They can say it says Dave.
Oh, done.
It says Dave.
I'll take a photo of that.
I can go in the
Dave motivate.
Right, so
the clue.
Right, so
We found the place by its coordinates
and the full description,
well, there isn't one.
But it does say
outside.
What about that?
Like a path of people.
So the details, it says
other.
Size other.
Judicial cash which means it'll be
container of some kind.
And it says other.
It doesn't say magnetic.
This is a magnetic thing.
I'm quite sure what it is.
I think it's one of those things
they have to put around trees to protect the trunks.
That tree done gone.
You're absolutely right.
It doesn't seem to be
anything.
Yeah.
I'll have a nosey around there in a second.
Let me just
ship the logs to make sure.
So five days ago,
the cash owner.
Oh, it's not the cash owner.
I like to kick over a rock and rock.
That's nice.
Bit of a search.
Bit of a search found it.
No, we haven't found it, love.
No, we haven't found it.
Second time.
So I'm just looking at the previous find
to see if we can identify where it is.
So I think what we're going to have to do is
have a walk around the outside.
Alex, do you want me to go first, mate?
There are lots of stingy nettles around there.
So everybody else is chickened out.
Despite the fact.
Despite the fact,
I also have no legs on.
I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Hang on, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, we're going away from it.
If you go by the coordinates,
we are going away from it.
Okay.
So.
Hey, what about it?
Well, Alex, you've just rubbed up against stingy nettles.
There is nothing
to indicate
a clue or anything like that,
apart from outside.
So if we
just do a quick
GPS.
So at the moment,
I'm at six feet, four feet,
three feet,
two feet,
one foot.
Right.
So.
It suggests that it's here.
And yeah, no.
Look at that tree there.
It looks like it might have been
trodden out a bit.
I'm not about that.
I'm not going there,
because I already got a stingy.
You got a sting.
Oh, mate.
Come here.
So we're carrying.
We'll just stay.
Oh, there's some copper cable here.
I wonder if it was actually a fence at one point.
Images.
Images.
Now, someone has taken a picture of that.
That metal structure.
Yeah.
And in fact, our friend,
has taken a photograph directly in front of that.
So,
let me try and get out of here
without getting stuck.
I got a sting.
Oh.
I found one looks like it's loose,
but it's a bit higher.
You wouldn't never get that.
I think I do have a little bump.
I think I have something.
A bird pooped on there.
What's on the other side of that?
Yeah, mate.
You can have a look.
I'm not there yet in here.
How would you get to it?
Maybe it's that one there,
if I had been screwed up.
Yeah, you got to be like six feet tall together.
No, that's not moving.
Oh, there you can, mate.
I just got my glasses.
Oh, that's what you said out.
Not because you got to stung her out.
No, I got stung and they...
You dropped your glasses.
It's because of stuma.
There's nobody in there.
Really?
Oh, it's not a brood, it's not brood.
Oh, Alex.
Oh, right, there's mummies in here.
I'll come with you.
I'll come with you.
I'll be alright as well.
Well, I'm very disappointed by the fact
they've actually given us no actual usable clothes.
Nothing underneath is it, mate.
What, tucked under?
Yeah.
There are no details.
Oh, no, did you?
Oh, we have to go to a hospital.
It was a really thick one.
A really thick, chunky cobweb.
Yeah, it was on the brick.
I let my hand on the brick and then my hand was full of cobweb.
Lovely.
Yeah, we've got the hospital.
I'm not going in there.
I went in and I looked.
It's Cache's logic had our hand in this.
Sorry?
Cache's logic had our hand in this.
Oh, do I hate him and does that?
No.
A bit of a search for me had it.
Widened out the search a little fat signy called out that she'd found it.
Sneaky hide, great location for Cache.
Somebody's favorite, isn't it?
We've got a photo there.
Oh, that's the photo.
Yeah.
There's a bit of light.
Yeah.
Maybe it's being a con.
Well, I'm going to DNF this one.
I'm trying this series.
I'm doing it.
That one.
Less it means outside as in, as in in the first album, not in the first one.
Well, that's not outside, is it?
No.
That's the other one.
That's the other one.
What are you doing?
Ah, yeah.
Oh, you're badger.
Got Stan.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, horrible stings, badges.
Okay, so not much luck here, we'll pause again and fire up at the next one, hopefully.
You know, we might actually find the next one.
So we're about 400 feet now from the next one, we're approaching some muggles so we'll
find it very soon, very shortly.
That's Alex, you can hear.
So that's the muggles gone.
In case you're curious, it's just a Y.
We have to be careful around people that aren't geocaching, is for as many people who are
bought into the game and want to do it, there are probably as many people who want to stop you from doing it.
And it wouldn't surprise me if there were people who were subscribed as premium members to go around
and actually destroy the caches that we're looking for.
Oh yeah.
I didn't try to do water on someone like me.
So we'll be followed by a muggle.
They're not saying that a lot of people do this, but certainly if people saw you rummaging
around for a geocache, they might be intrigued enough to try and actually find it for themselves.
And if they do find it and they're not invested in the game, then you don't know what they're going to do with it.
They could destroy it, they could take it away, they could rip it apart, they could do anything they wanted with it.
That's something we want to try and avoid.
Now I've used the words bought into a few times.
Hang on a second, I've just gone past it.
It is a subscription service, you can do other geocaching.com, which is the official site, you can pay a premium.
It's about £25 a year, what's that, 30?
Oh, fungus.
About $30 a year.
There are open, non-pay services like open caching, but you'll find that there aren't actually that many of them.
So, yeah, paying the extra for geocaching.com kind of makes sense.
Right, so this caching number seven, number seven sandal beat.
It's a small cache.
7th box in, oh, it's another one with absolutely no background information at all.
The hint, rock bottom.
So underneath the rock.
Now, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm seeing a distinct lack of rocks.
Now, the map, I zoom in.
It does suggest it's further this way.
Oh, we're still 30 feet from it, hold up, guys.
Ah, lovely, let's walk through holly trees.
Yeah, just watch out for holly bushes, ow.
Yeah, well, don't show off.
Well, there's a rock at the bottom.
So, wander if, and it says we're 9 feet from it, and that is about 10 feet away.
So, can you see that car or do you want me to go?
I'll go.
Yeah, hold on to.
That is brambles, no brambles.
So, that rock right in the middle there may be a fake rock.
It's not a fake rock.
What about that rim brick behind you?
Yes, there's a red brick.
Oh, no, that one there, okay.
That was a worm.
No thing.
There's not a rock in there, but there could be a rock in there at some point.
Is there a rock there behind that tree, Clara?
A little tree.
Oh, yes, yes there is.
No, no, to the left.
To the left.
There.
A little tree hanging up.
And there's a rock behind it.
There's a rock behind it.
You can walk.
So, I'm trying to wait for the rock.
That's not a horse.
That's not even a hornet.
It's a hover fly.
That's pretty tight.
It's not going to sting you.
It doesn't sting you.
It doesn't sting you.
Those things might be though.
Well.
Why did you go up there and then go across?
Why not just going in front of it?
Yeah.
Don't, it's so great to be able to stand on the sidelines and bark out orders, isn't it?
Keep going.
It's not going to bother you.
It's not bothered.
Is it hovering in place?
I know.
Then it's a hover fly.
It's a frog.
It's a frog.
So fun.
Where's the frog?
Where is it going to sting you?
It's going to sting you.
It's going to sting you.
It's going to sting you.
It's going to sting you.
It's going to sting you.
I'll just put the mouse on the cobwebs.
Yeah.
Would you like some help, love?
Have it.
Is eating.
Right, would you hold my phone?
I will keep the recorder.
Good luck.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you're going to be the one that's standing at the sidelines shouting out orders.
orders. I don't want to be honest. I feel really cushioning on there. Get out of my way.
Yeah, sit, sit, sit. You're going to whack it by that.
The computer says no.
Take the underneath that box which looks like the beginning.
This one.
You don't want it being down here. It's like a waste of time.
There is a bit of that brick at the front of you too.
Where?
Near the tree, guys.
The one that I just picked over.
This one.
No.
What's that?
See that?
There's another bit of brick up there.
That's not what bottom those you love. That's not particularly accessible.
Look what we like.
Part of the problem here is that we're on a bed of really, really thick leaves.
I'm scared a bit.
You might like it.
You want to what?
Are you tracking the distance?
I want some down there.
I'm scared a bit.
I'm scared that you're going to finish that sentence.
I'm scared that these leaves are not good.
How do you mean not good?
I don't know. I just was going so many things.
No.
Hello.
Okay.
Underneath this bit of that.
Okay. Yeah.
Or was there anything in front of it? Just in case.
But it's definitely in the general direction because it's seven feet on looking down to you.
It's definitely not in my gap.
Wow.
Could have been down that way.
It's six feet.
Come here.
Is that my phone?
Yeah.
But let me have it a sec.
Let me see if I can get an accurate reading on the coordinates.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
No, I think...
Ah.
Now according to this I'm too far in.
I will find most of this is
in which direction.
This way.
Whoa.
Things falling down from the tree.
What?
Whatever is up there.
There's just not some evidence that they've cooked.
I told you things are far in now.
No, no, no.
I'm not holding it out.
That's just ten feet.
There's six feet when I find them down here.
Yeah.
This says ten feet.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Right, we're definitely moving away from here.
I wonder if it's behind you, love.
No.
Wow.
It's what?
It's...
Wow.
You can use the branch.
Let's do it.
Last one.
I'm still trying to escape.
So now it's saying six feet.
Yeah.
Nine feet.
And now it's stopped updating.
Maybe it's fast cut.
Don't touch them, they've got...
Eight feet, ten feet.
Five feet.
Under there, and in the head.
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's beautiful.
That's beautiful.
That's 13 feet.
Yes, mate.
Yep.
Yep, that might not mean the bottom of something.
I don't believe we're about to get scuppered for the third time.
Yep.
That's not a rock bottom.
That's right in the ground.
That might not mean the bottom of something.
I don't believe we're about to get scuppered for the third time.
No, we're not.
We did so well last week.
Twice.
What?
Patrick Carr and...
Nostle.
100%.
What?
What?
Which was the one where...
I don't know which one was which.
Which one was Patrick Carr or which one was the other one?
Nostle was the one where you'd already been.
That's the first...
Do you actually ever found?
Nostle primary.
Yeah.
So we got 100% of those.
And Patrick Carr was the one we went to a couple of days later.
One of the comments that...
Yeah.
I think it's around that tree somewhere.
Someone said...
Not near the ditch.
Someone said widen search.
Not bearish to the cord.
Oh, lady!
Make it!
Someone said that that was the photo.
Found it not near the ditch.
You may actually get a few hours.
First one found.
Blah blah blah.
What a comment in the log.
Check the photo pointing to the cat.
Oh, okay.
So that's the photo.
Which is here.
This is the first time in my life.
The growing neck.
I bet it's in this cat somewhere, but...
Well, hang on, what trees that?
That's that tree there.
Yeah.
I want to pick up a stick and go.
Oh, no!
No, it's not.
Am I allowed to grab a stick and slash at the hollow?
Um, you can do.
I don't know if it's going to have much of an effect.
It's a multi-tronk tree.
That isn't.
Or is it?
Yes, it is.
I've always wanted to do this
because I'm not sure if it's going to work or not.
No, I think this is it.
Picking my anger out on the tree.
Please don't hurt it.
You're extremely close.
I'm just looking.
Oh, it becomes a vehicle with an engine.
I'm not sure it's so sweet
but the off-short isn't.
I think it's deep in here.
That's too far apart.
Which tree?
You reckon?
That's heck of a long way out from the coordinates.
Does it fit without the coordinates?
No, they're too thick love.
Oh!
Look at the shape.
Partly.
That looks like there used to be something there.
Doesn't it?
It's over.
I'll look around the other side.
That's not good.
And it's around a holiday.
That, to me, it looks like it's going to move.
Just the shape.
Yeah, potentially.
Hang on.
What are you?
Well off.
Got it.
Right.
Right in my eye.
Flip.
Right, okay.
We have finally found our first of three.
It was at the bottom of the rock.
It's at the clue being rock bottom.
It is actually a fake rock.
Do you feel it?
Stop piling up.
Look, come here.
There we go.
Yeah, look where I see it.
Mmm, slow.
At least he's not trying to drop your nuts on it.
On your head.
Drop his nuts when you're heading.
Look at this.
Get off.
Where's my pen?
There it is.
Flip.
Okay.
The corners are well off.
About the image and other comments would never have found.
This is the first log.
What you find is Lee.
Okay, Lee family in here.
Twenty.
Twenty-secth of the eighth.
The third one is nine eighths.
Isn't very good.
Lee.
Yeah.
Family.
Isn't very good at the corner.
Well, hopefully no one listens to this nose, Sarah, whatever number is.
Sorry.
It may not be her.
It may be the technology she was using at the time.
It is possible that if she was using a crappy smartphone or something or the GPS hadn't settled
by the time she was looking for it.
Oh, could it be?
That is intonally possible.
Oh, crap.
I got it from.
Oh.
But at least the clue was right.
That was nice that day.
I used to like him then.
I keep hearing.
Those noises are Dave losing his trousers.
Woo-hoo.
Not really.
You're transferring it now.
Anyway.
You said he wants to be a natural.
Not in that. Where's my phone?
There it is.
Timmy pockets.
Right, so we can now log this as a fine finally.
So log visit.
Coordinates well out.
Only found due to previous comments and a photo of the tree.
Which is about 30 feet in the corner as well.
Right, so at my calculation we have been speaking now for best part of three quarters of now.
And we have finally found a geocache.
Anyway.
That was all we really wanted to tell you about is about the game of geocaching and it is fun.
It is fun but can be frustrating at times.
Very much so.
I'll put into the show notes linked to all the things that we've mentioned.
geocaching.com.
The apps we use etc.
Caroline is attempting to remove a bottle from my back pocket.
And we've taken a couple photographs as well which will include two.
Including we'll also put a link into the cache we just found.
So if you want to actually have a look and see what it is we've logged and
and the things that we were seeing then please do so.
But I don't even go without my tool.
There's a love bug along with.
Hi, Caroline.
Caroline.
What's your name?
Alex.
Alex.
