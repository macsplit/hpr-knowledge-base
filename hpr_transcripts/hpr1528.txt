Shove into music.
Hi, this is Mark Waters, it's 10 to 4 Thursday, 15 to May 2014.
I've just parked my tricop at Shatam Bridge, just south of Shiro, after 30 odd kilometer ride,
did some shopping and shit, and parked my cup, locked it, got changed into my wetsuit,
and I just don't have to go for a little swim, I've got an old MP3 player attached to my
woolly hat, with a plastic band, and you can come with me for a swim down the river today.
It's kind of windy, so you're going to get a bit of noise from that, but it's lovely and bright,
there's a blue sky, there's no cloud, in the water now, first bit of a bit tricky here,
because there's the leaves breaking down, and making me think of shit, whatever it is,
there you can hear that shit bubbling away, just things, and believe it's toxic,
there we go, just like to get into the water seriously, this is where the water goes up through
the zip and the back of the wetsuit, and it's the least pleasant part of the whole effort,
just paddling under the bridge downstream, on my back, just going to get the water into the suit,
and going to get underway and get you to it, there we go, this swimming spot here is not my
favourites, because we start at the top, and then the first half of the trip is downstream,
which is quite pleasant, but it does make the swimming back when you're tired and a bit cold,
just a little bit more difficult, I think all the others, we actually swim upstream to start with,
so you're exercising and warm, and it's nice, and then you kind of can float back,
back down to the bike, that's the nice place here,
the wind rippling across the water where there aren't trees on the side, it makes it sparkle,
which is quite nice, and then in other patches, it's just still,
I'm just putting one to the front, one to my front, three, and let's get underway,
okay,
dirty pad on my right,
on dragonflies, as a pigeon, hello,
I'm going to take a look at it.

I'm going to take a little bit more.
I'm going to take a little bit in my left.
I'm going to take a little bit in my left.
I think it's going to be a bit distilled here, sometimes just coves in it, I can't see any
I can hear one, I can see a cow, I can see a few now.
I can't see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow, I can see a cow,

I can see a cow with a white andì”¨ in my eye. And there's a message there. There's a message down the rice. There's more apples, something good, a bit judging why.
Oh, I can see some bones, part down there, there, I hope they're not fishing there.
Let me see them.
I'll pick a wide berth on the right.
I've not seen anybody there at all.
I guess it's a farmer.
I can see a fish in the eye.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm new show.
The map of the sea?
Yes, the sea.
Oh, it's the map.
Oh, it's the map.
Oh, it's the sea.
It's the sea.
Oh, it's the sea.
Oh, it's the sea.
Oh, it's the sea.
I'm so far on the right.
Not biologically, I mean in the river.
Not to home passing on the actual branches of the trees that are overhang,
overhang, overhang, overhang, overhang.
Which is something I usually avoid.
And then you don't get things like spiders ripping on you.
They've got four robs there, the two guys, all cows have congregated round the vand,
obviously one of them was going on, I haven't seen any fish in one now before, at least
they were pleasant, but it's usually a bit unusual, normally they're telling me to turn around
or you just don't even bother saying anything, just scowl it, yeah, okay, and the river
goes around here, back to the right a bit, kind of does a gentle S shape, obviously the
wave doesn't get in here because it's got a stuff, there's all leaves and paddled on the water,
there we go, there's no need to play some space here for a while, there we go, awesome,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
That's it, it's now just going straight up in here, all the way down to the river, this
time of day.
The sun is on the left, as I go down, just over the tops of the trees. The river is kind of in shade,
some sunlight patches, but it's mostly kind of in shade.
The sun is on the right side of the river, and the sun more. I don't know if it makes any difference.
I might work, but it's easier to stay stuck.
The sun is on the right side of the river, and the sun is on the right side of the river.
The sun is on the right side of the river, and the sun is on the right side of the river.
The sun is on the right side of the river, and the sun is on the right side of the river.
It's going to slip on my back, it's work done, that's enough, work for a bit.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip on my back.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip on my back.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip.
It's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip on my back, it's going to slip on my back.
It comes on my front.
I'm passing multiple rows of really tall trees, I don't know what they are, they're quite tall and they're catching the wind.
That's what makes that kind of rustling noise.
And just ahead of me is the wheel, which is my turnaround point.
I guess I'm not even supposed to climb in down the wheel and then walking through a shallow bit just to carry on.
I think this is about six hundred meters.
I think this section here is twelve hundred one hundred meters from now.
Certainly plenty.
I don't have, but all west, I don't know.
There's a concrete section here, but slightly lower than the rest of the wheel, so the majority
of the water goes down in this bit, and that's what I'm turning around today.
Ah, another on bid.
I'm going to have to go to the other side to see if I'm going to be able to reach the other side.

I'm going to be able to reach the other side.
the kind of avenue section done again, I'm now back into the big S, the first part of
the S. Just gently paddling upstream. Oh, and into the sunlight again. I can see two planes,
well, not the planes, but the trailed parallel. Many miles away, up in the sky. There's a tree
down here into the river, actually there's one on both sides. Dead, for the cobwebs.
And I managed to keep it the position during the winter when the river gets high and cleaned out.
So on the other side was that part before, but it's now at a kind of 45 degrees in the river.
Also dead.
The water in the shore on here is a kind of greeny color. I can see my hands. I can
see as far as my hands, but I can't see the bottom. Let me go up right to see if I can touch the bottom here.
So it's, yeah, I definitely can't touch the bottom. Oh, and it's certainly cold down there.
Oh, I'm coming back on the surface.
Just coming back up to the corner. I'll be able to see the fish in one.
Again in a second, so I came to kind of give a breaststroke.
It's cold, swimming.
I can see the chips and the little shut-on.
My right up the hill.
Right top roofs.
I don't know if you can see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to see it, but I think it's a good idea to

not to see in the shutdown bridge, just having a look into them, but welcome sight.
Two people on that short bridge, not seeing that in the heart.
Those people just drive.
Yeah, almost done.
Just coming up to the bridge.
It's so cool to be able to see it from the side.
I don't know.
We've got to let many people see the rain with the puffy rice.
All right.
That's the trick.
Oh, I'm just going to get through this.
I'm not going to turn again.
Stunning up.
Oh, ah.
Ah.
You're taking it into it?
Oh, that's things.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
I'm tired.
I'm not.
What?
Almost an hour.
50 minutes.
What works the best?
Oh, cool.
Catch you next time.
Catch you next time.
Catch you next time.
