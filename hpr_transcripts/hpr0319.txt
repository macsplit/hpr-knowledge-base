it's
Well, two days before the Valentine's Day, how long have you been before the Valentine's Day?
Field General Fantasy Salt.
Don't go that way.
You have to look the other way.
Keep your hands on a table.
Fair enough.
Okay.
So, do we have anything else to eat?
Is it real game?
Tell him about your Nvidia card book power.
Well, I left.
I was trying to reduce the amount of electricity my computer uses.
Oh, he's rude.
He's one guy with a good reason to deal with it.
Yeah, so I don't know.
I was playing around with that.
What else I did?
Computer of the world.
I don't know what the camera was.
Should I guess?
He was open source of mobile movies.
No, no, I don't think I did any of that this week.
Good morning, Andrew.
Well, maybe I'll remember seeing this.
This group is going higher and higher.
Maybe I'm getting brownie more.
Maybe.
Maybe.
I'll just be a fool.
How about you?
You home or?
No, I don't know.
Yeah.
Did you at least have a training show in the summer?
What?
You don't know?
Yeah, you don't know.
Well, you know, you need to have a training.
Which way?
Age.
You're closing.
March 6th.
So you don't need to complain?
No, it's going to be online.
It's going to be online.
It's one and forty volume.
And grass marches and pepperoni.
If you need to have a training, go going to grass.
I am.
That's okay.
I know how to do that.
I don't think you're done.
I'll figure it out.
Other than that, yeah, I haven't really done too much.
I've been kind of busy with house, wedding, and work.
All those three things going together.
And yeah.
Now, I'll show a couple of kids there.
You'll really be busy.
I'm hoping.
I'm hoping these three things are going to go away.
The work?
The work may be not completely, but at least a little bit.
All kind of old.
You'll be there eating someday.
Take another.
Actually, you know what I'm talking about, work.
It looks pretty dense, but actually, I don't understand.
It doesn't look that good.
The weather or the country?
No, the country.
You have a company that is getting rid of 10,000 people.
So, yeah, you got a job, be thankful.
Well, I think saying it doesn't look good is if you understand it.
Yeah.
Well, it's really bad.
I mean, it doesn't look good in it.
It doesn't look like there's an end yet.
That's the scary part.
I think things are like gold like this.
Yeah, gold.
And you know, something about playing that first,
the housing gets to be corrected.
And I'm saying, well, if you have a board stock inventory of houses,
you don't use houses like your shoes, you know.
I mean, the housing stays there for years and years and years.
So, if you don't fulfill your inventory.
Well, see, that's the European perspective.
But, you know, for a way we've been running the economy for the 20 years,
people have been flipping houses to make a profit.
And see, it's a completely different perspective on what owning a house.
And it's a wrong one, I think.
It's a wrong one.
The house economy is just in the house of the world.
The price for so long.
And now it's finally catching up.
Right.
Now the house is in the price of all what they should be.
And everybody says, oh, it's a recession.
Everybody actually, you know, if you have 30% of empty houses there,
but everybody has a place where to live.
Yeah.
So, where do these people go live?
Yeah.
Down by the river, it must be just crowded.
Is there no one there?
So, they have lived somewhere.
Well, I know you haven't been to some of the cities I've been to.
There's a lot of people living on the street.
And a lot of, you know, there's a lot of veterans.
More of the South, South, part of the United States.
New York City, Washington, Philadelphia, all of Cleveland,
New York City.
But you're right.
There's like 25% on enrollment.
It could easily be true.
And it's on its desk.
Yeah.
We lived through a period in Pittsburgh where the, when the mills closed
where our neighborhood was at about 40% on enrollment.
Yeah.
That was trying pretty ugly.
Yeah, it was really ugly.
So, we have very much that it can kind of be that I walk your dog and you.
And you walk my dog and everybody's going to be happy.
So, guess that's another image for the House of Cards, really.
Yeah.
But then, yeah, all the, all the manufacturing jobs I've gone.
Yeah.
So, I mean, 10%, 11% of the people are in manufacturing.
I think it used to be like 60.
Oh, it was majority of the job.
I mean, it was, I remember 60, some of the, some of the sales.
So, do you have more useless jobs for people to do?
Haven't created enough.
No, that's the problem.
That's the whole problem.
That is here.
No, we don't have enough jobs for people.
We need more useless jobs.
See, here's more.
Here's more.
See, here's more.
Here's more.
Here's my way of thinking about it.
What they should do is bring the cost of living in line with some kind of realistic evaluation
of things, cut the work week drastically, like, you know, even somewhat less than the European
work week, and then give more people jobs so you get the same work done, and you could pay them less
because the cost of living is less when things are more realistically priced.
But that would require a complete revamping of our whole economic system.
Yeah.
I don't want to revive the old one.
I don't want that to work.
No, of course.
It's in certain parts of the world.
There was a push for 40 plus years to make stuff like that in the engineer cost of living.
What it doesn't want to work that way?
No.
So, they're going to push inflation, you know, and steal our money that way since they can't steal it
by putting us into a paralyzing debt.
Well, the money is just a scheme.
You know, government is buying a government that will have a pile of papers.
That's all there is.
Well, that's happening the day time, the whole of the day.
The government's full bank account.
That's nothing to do with it.
Yeah.
Orange County.
Well, how about Iceland?
How about Iceland?
How about Iceland?
Yeah.
I wouldn't want to live there right now.
I wouldn't want to live there right now.
But did it go away?
No.
You'll live there.
Nobody will put you away anywhere.
If you like things going on like happened in Argentina, which is starting to happen in Iceland,
if you want to be, so you can't go out in the street because somebody a rob you will beat you up for.
That's why you'll wait all the whole time.
That's why you want?
The way I want to stop you.
The way I want to stop you.
I mean, with an nature.
That's why you go way away.
And nobody can take it and be broken down.
Yeah.
Well.
All right.
I just can save the world.
Actually, yes.
Yes and many.
Okay.
So, where are we in the two minutes of favor?
Is Byron going?
Or he didn't do it?
I don't really done anything else.
Okay.
Playing around with the Gibson.
It's up.
It's up.
Again.
Probably.
And that's about it.
Byron actually has, if I've curiously been doing something with Linux this week, because I was messing around with the script.
He sent me for dumping the file system with my EGALA frame.
I've done the breaking of the zip file.
No, actually about that.
It's still going.
It's now up to...
It's up to Capital Cues with seven characters now.
And you're running a group or the EGALA?
Yeah.
On a zip file.
Is that like one of those blurts?
Like it goes up like one times two.
Then one times two times three times three times four times four times.
Yeah.
Well, the interesting thing is that it actually finds possible passwords.
Because all the students generating possible passwords now.
We're up to like 2600 something of them.
It's just going to list right now.
Yeah.
It's just making a list.
Right.
So every day when you get back home.
And you have a password.
Oh, more than that.
And the interesting thing is that it actually finds them in spurts.
Because we'll go back it, you know, reasonably even intervals.
And sometimes it'll be like maybe nine, maybe ten, twelve.
But then signs will go back and it'll be like thirty five or forty five.
And it would essentially the same duration of time.
So it finds them in spurts.
Oh, well then you can get another program that actually tests the passwords.
It's about two phase deal.
Oh, it's going to actually try to enter.
We'll turn this list that it's making now into a library.
And then it'll go through the library or dictionary.
Yeah, they'll run a script and it'll test each of those.
So somehow it puts them in there.
Yeah, put them in there and try to open the list.
Really?
You can do that.
Yeah.
Wow, that's kind of slick.
Yeah.
No, I think so.
I'm very determined that.
Yeah.
Well, it's kind of fun.
I mean, I wanted to see what would happen.
What do you know?
It's just going through combinations of awkward order keys.
Yeah, basically.
Also.
Yeah, no, you give it, you give it what you want.
And we told it to do all possible combinations of lowercase.
Uppercase and special characters, anything on the keyboard.
No.
And numbers and numbers.
And basically, you give it a range and we said the password
should have between four and 12 characters.
So what's going on?
So do you try these passwords now?
No, that's what he was just asking.
It's making a list of possible passwords.
Right.
And after it gets that, we can turn that into a dictionary or a
library file.
Oh, it easily, easily.
Yeah.
You can download more of this, too.
Yeah.
Well, see, that's it.
Of course, we're not even sure this is going to be in English
because it's a program.
I didn't remember how I got it.
But basically, what happens is it's a drum machine.
Yeah.
And the people who originally made it, apparently,
sold it to somebody else.
And they're in Indians.
And it uses a non-Western Indian system of rhythms
to do the drum machine.
That's why I'm interested in it.
So the guy who originated it, nobody can find the earliest
versions of it.
Somebody sent me this.
And I don't know why they encrypted it.
And I don't remember who sent it.
I can't, the email I got it from doesn't exist anymore.
And I can't find these people who sent it to me.
What's that?
No.
And the people who actually still sell the program that glitzed
it up so much that it doesn't work like the old drum machine
at all.
It's much busier showing you pictures of ants being on drums.
You know, with a flash animation.
And that's no good for what I'm going to use it for.
So I've got this encrypted zip file that I can read the names
of the files in it.
Now, Byron, you sent me also this thing where, apparently,
with that much of a plain text head start,
we should be able to break the password quicker.
But I don't really understand that guy's instructions.
I'm reading them and rereading until it comes clear.
Yeah, I don't understand that.
I don't necessarily really just...
This is how you do it by...
Yeah, well, there's two parts to it.
First of all, you have to have something that's a real text thing
out of the file that you know is in there.
And then you also have to create a bogus file
that has a CRC sum exactly the same as the file you're trying to break.
And then when you put those two pieces of information
into this other...
A zip, is it called a zip program?
It somehow can use that information and come up with a crack quicker.
So you actually need these two parts to it.
You have to like assemble a zip file that has exactly the same CRC
that the zip file that you're trying to break.
CRC is a redundant call.
What is that?
It's like a redundancy check.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
So somehow that...
And it's A, yes, encryption.
So it's like, you know, 248 bid.
But it's a big key.
I mean, it's not...
It's a heavy encryption.
So...
Yeah, it's not meant to be broken in place.
Yeah.
So anyway, back to the IGALA frame anyway.
So, but you're a little stripped.
All you dumped was the FC file, right?
I don't know if I gave you that one.
Yeah.
Because I'm...
I'm not the other one that I remember.
I was wondering how long it took to dump it.
And you also only gave me the...
You didn't write it as a script.
It doesn't have the bang, bin shell thing, and stuff like that.
And the way I did it, I rewrote it to be explicit path statement.
It's just to make sure it didn't write where I didn't want it to.
Yeah.
But anyway, I was going to ask you how long it took to do it.
Because it's been added for about an hour and an hour and a half.
But still, I didn't have it.
I'm dumping the entire operating system off the IGALA frame onto USB drive
so I can see what it is.
The thing that probably makes the difference is I didn't have any pictures on it when I did it.
I don't have very few.
I have very few.
It didn't really take that wrong.
Oh, it's taken for that.
So I think...
What you had was a copy with a recursive switch.
And you had a copy in slash Etsy slash to file system slash Etsy.
So I'm doing slash star to a dump file that I created on the USB drive.
So it's taken a while.
So we veiled on it after about what?
At 20 minutes or so, it had about 47 megs copy.
So now I'm figuring that there are probably about 120 or 25 megs in the whole system.
I guess that's what I'm...
That's the other question, halfway.
Do you know if the CP command in embedded Linux has a bail for recursive loops?
Or is it going to get into a recursive loop with the temp file?
I didn't come across any recursive loops.
Because I mean, I know a desktop will bail on it.
It won't just be rewriting that directory.
And I think it's the same...
The same politics tools, the GNU tool chain.
Okay, so it should be okay.
It'll write 120 or something, megs and a quick.
It should just write it out to the desk.
Do you know if they have tar on there?
I took a peek in the bin directory to see if it had tar...
Well, then you can use tar.
You can use tar to just write it to standard out.
Did you send it to a different directory?
Yeah.
It's pretty much just a full Linux operating system.
Well, the only thing is they didn't put on there was SSH.
That would have been nice.
Yeah, well actually it has two open ports.
It has the FTP port open at 21.
It has...
Yeah, it has a TCP port open at 512.

Yeah, I could say.
To say I was quite present with guys.
I think you are using those guys.
I don't know.
He got some pre-hypatized guys and this is incredible.
The development company did really be actually lonely stuff,
not let you divide them on site.
Were you in the courses that was based
So it used to be a web development group in that barstead building.
Wesley Wheeling.
I think he was a little pal of ours from the CVF and stuff, yeah.
I think he was in the next user.
Yeah, yeah.
Wesley's a real nice guy.
He's pretty busy.
That's how my dog was running a couple of years ago.
But he's pretty busy with his own life.
I said, I think one is a once in a while.
Yeah, it's too bad he doesn't come because he's quite knowledgeable and he's a very nice guy.
If he's not.
If you're listening Wes, we need you.
Then I was talking to you, right?
It's going to be about that day.
Probably he won't come because he can't smoke here, right?
Wes is a smoker.
If you can't, he's not going anywhere.
That's right.
If he's a smoker, I don't think I...
Maybe what his problem is, he's in with Joel.
He says there's something I don't know.
You know, we changed the place of the dream to be here now.
You fell out alone that soon.
Yeah.
Back to provocation.
It's the depression.
Yeah.
I agree.
Yeah, people have to make money somehow.
I don't know.
There were people who were making out in the depression with the moonshotners.
Yeah.
I don't know why I'm out in eight years though.
That's right.
He's your son.
He's thinking ahead.
You are.
Yeah.
I'm actually a programmer with a little mic control.
My roommate's really being grooming.
She's got a couple of setups to do with a little mic fridges and some stuff.
I just got her to...
It's a brown spot tree now.
I don't know.
It was called...
The reason that it was too...
It was the temperature controlling.
So you need the blood.
Oh, I think no.
Yeah, yeah.
You can...
Oh, you're...
You're too servicing, man.
You're too...
You can actually get it.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how the refrigerator is doing.
Oh, well, actually we just started something like that, though.
You know.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's pretty cheap.
Well, it's like $150.
You get a thermostat with a probe.
Like an extended probe that you stick in the refrigerator.
Oh, yeah.
We still need some of that stuff.
Turn it into a thermostat all the way up in the refrigerator.
And then you just point it into the thermostat.
So, well, he actually has that right now.
And we want to do some push down.
That's what I mean.
That's what I mean.
Oh.
Yeah, that actually reminds me of...
I've read somewhere that a P4 was originally developed to be a controller for a refrigerator.
That would have been quite a...
There'd be a controller that's actually something in the refrigerator.
Oh, here.
Yeah.
It's a P4.
Depending on the system.
Depending on the system.
Depending on the system.
It's actually supposed to be a controller for commercial refrigerators.
Maybe in the original Pentium.
I don't know about Pentium 4.
Yeah, why the hell would you want that?
Well, maybe it was just...
Maybe it's one of those with the DVD player built in.
I don't know.
Those always seem kind of useless to them.
Maybe it was the original Pentium 4 refrigerator.
You'll see if you have a mail in it.
I wish you would do that.
No, I just played DVDs.
Yeah.
You always can watch the porn indication.
Yeah.
The porn indicator.
There you go.
Some of those old refrigerators with the little windows that tell you your ice cubes are ready.
To watch a video on that.
Your ice cubes are ready.
So, you got mad at your ice cube.
The cube's done.
Do we know that there is...
Overestore.
Oh, really?
No, I don't know.
There's a new one.
We restored.
Two.
More than that.
Boston.
There's both in Boston.
Boston.
Yeah, Boston.
There you go.
Yeah.

Pitchers were the only protected bet.
You pulled them up with tamos, maybe.
We need the collection every now and then,
and I thought of you
as well.
Just tell...
To, have I...
I think, you know, this is the same thing
when we begin the news.
You, you, need to line people
to see what you are, and that إلى
on the Grewабот'
is that when you try to improve your system, you want to know techniques, you want to know how to do it.
If you get exchange information, if you do not know, you can do it too.
You create a beard, it's called beard, but if you want to go farther,
there's no name on the watch side of the face.
It's a CV, better, groomer.com or CV.
What's going on?
It's a based out probe.
That's okay, you don't break a beard.
All right, I'm good.
I'm sure you are on the beard.
That's actually what I do.
Oh, you know the thing about your...
Media?
No, it takes a long time.
It has like methods.
That's why I cut my losses.
I was like, no, me.
The thing about your burners, why they don't want them used inside,
is that you can't count on them not producing CO.
Yes.
And that's what that's the thing.
Even if you got it going all right, if you're going to not attend it,
there's things that can happen where it will start to create CO.
That's why they don't produce CO.
The amount of volume in the burner.
That's the size of the burner.
Yeah, a stove pot burner is less than $10,000.
It's going to be a pretty big burner in broad.
There's some big propane tank.
It's like a big 10 gallon.
Maybe a turkey fire?
Yeah, that's what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those are what I want.
$50,000.
Those things you buy for a turkey fire is about $50,000.
Yes.
Yeah, but see, your garage isn't your basement either.
You see some.
Yeah.
The whole garage is usually pretty well badly.
And that's the thing.
You get down that basement.
Because CO is heavy, it stays down there.
You walk down there.
It'll put you down before you realize that.
My cat will be there.
Yeah.
That goes.
That goes.
If you go slow.
If you still have a canary like to me,
you go down the stairs with the canary.
No, you just put the canary in the basement and you wait 20 minutes
until you see the canary.
It's hard to park me.
You'll let them actually try to...
This is a cool bunch of people.
So these people mean it no better?
Yeah.
Yes.
Next meeting is...
Here we have it.
Next meeting is on...
Archway one.
No, I don't get what's three corners.
Seven.
Where are all the cabinets?
Did they drink all that beer that's on the table?
No, that was a competition.
So could you drink more beer?
And there's actually four of them there too.
Nice.
Yeah, that's good.
It just got started.
Mm-hmm.
So we can go there.
The...
But I'm going to try this more active.
You know, there, there, there, there.
I think Oprah is longer standing,
but then I'm going to club...
As far as the four of them is more active.
I'm going to club.
Interesting.
But yeah, I'm going to pick one next.
Like me, when I'm trying to...
Some of these bike controllers that are...
Like, with the one on the next.
I'll also do some of, like, touch screens.
That's kind of this plan on my plan.
Yeah.
For just monitoring a graph,
like, camera control.
That's super familiar.
Graphs.
Graphs, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I really like the controllers.
Are there...
Yes.
They are.
They're fully programmed.
Are there...
They're actually very cool.
Yeah.
If you're running Linux on...
What's your setup?
If you're running Linux on...
Because there was just that article.
They were talking about that they just were work.
I thought they were Linux on the running.
I don't know if I'm actually...
I'm not really...
Maybe it's not.
I don't think they run an operating.
Yeah.
It's...
Hold on.
Is that that 8088 processor?
Is that what that is?
No, it's...
Yes.
What's the whole...
They call them...
What's that?
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...

It's...
It's...
It's...
It's...
But it does...
It does.
yeah...
It does works for like programming language.
There's...
They call itunter.
Yeah.
I've heard of these.
It's about 200-dan囉a miles ahead oftan.
Okay, y'all
I think we have your based Angela as melodies.
It connects to a PC, and then you program it with a PC, and then you can put it, and once you have it fully functional, you can put it up in a service.
What does that think cost? I mean, just, well, I think the official one right here is about 60, but the cool thing is like since it is open source, like there's other people that have the hardware that flash their own, so we picked up two of them for like 15 bucks each or something.
Some of the websites, this is a website called Spark Fund Act.
Oh, I have the data.
Oh, they sell this thing?
Yeah, they sell it.
So that's their own microcontroller?
Are you a kid?
You don't usually buy that.
Or you can buy a pre- you can pre- put together.
Yeah, who actually meets that chip?
Is that them?
Microcontroller?
Yeah, the actual, not the board, but the IC.
Yeah, the IC itself, the controller.
I think it almost looks like the app now is simple, but maybe not.
That's all you guys would work with.
Yeah.
Hold on.
I'm holding on here.
E-T.
I have E-N.
That's what I see.
That's kind of, you know, I can take more than that.
Yeah, that's the pretty popular doing stuff.
And the development, the ID or the development software,
it's all source.
It's all source.
Yeah.
I think it will design it as open source.
Wow.
I'm not really that familiar with embedded type stuff.
Okay.
Both of them, they get me and I do murder on them.
Yeah.
That doesn't look the other way around.
It's the E-T make-a-1.
At minimum, E-T make-a-1, 68.
Okay, so that's the one of their bigger chips.
Now, we take the old ones.
Yeah, we'll just be able to make them by spark fun.
Yeah, I've heard from them before.
Yeah, they sell the official one and there's lots of other random sites you can buy.
Wow.
Cheat ranks for $3.
They make it anyway.
Ah.
Good.
Yeah, a lot of this stuff is made elsewhere.
I don't know what it's called.
Go right, sorry.
Whether we need to make anything.
So it's a mega, you can just come.
Just go out of each other and dump.
Oh, there's actually a GCC version that will write code,
rank before that chip.
Yeah, I think it has a better architecture or whatever.
Yeah.
A-B-R-GCC.
Yeah.
Do you want to do that too?
Yeah.
That's what I want.
Oh, yeah.
Or it's going to be built by hand or purchased.
That's what I showed you.
I wasn't listening.
Yeah.
You know, my son, I'm here.
Hey, I don't like to.
Probably.
I don't like to shake you.
They're hanging.
I don't know if anybody's interested, but my employer's just started
and just got a contract for what was kind of some laser-reshing.
I think they're a CNC machine job type thing.
I don't know if it's CNC.
Well, it must be a laser, right?
I don't know.
Okay, just got to hold the laser.
Yeah.
That's something.
That's something.
It's a very, very reasonable pricing.
If anybody's having a laser-reshing gun.
You can get your monitor batched.
Yeah.
You can get the food to assemble.
The food to assemble, right?
The middle static.
I think that's a great idea.
Then you don't need to have it on your background.
You don't have to learn to use the tool.
Oh, he's writing on Claire.
Oh, I know.
It's about a week.
I'll turn around on time then.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to see you on.
I wanted to go there for this.
I'm like very, very impressed.
We're in there.
We're at.
We're at there close.
I don't know.
I don't know if you find out, but I'm not going to show you later.
Okay.
Specifically.
But I don't have any maintenance right now.
I don't know about this size.
Fairly detailed.
It was $1200.
Oh, Jesus.
That's very interesting.
And they will do the beginning.
Because most places require a fee.
They don't have a fee.
It's included in the price.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
I need to make it bold.
You can actually head your door out.
A little longer on your phone.
Just into the heart with it.
He's still like an open source like CNC type software out there.
I know there is.
I've never seen people like their own machines.
They're hard because they're soft.
They come with the full computerized control.
They come with a version of Linux.
And an open source cat package.
That's what their computer comes with.
So you can actually download that distribution and install it.
So it's some open source piece of software I just never looked at.
Yeah.
It's already a gene code they call it.
I don't know.
Wow.
That was interesting.
How are you doing?
Oh, I'm just wondering.
I've been playing with Juma.
Juma.
I'm trying to be able to say something.
It's Dr. Brian.
You don't like Juma?
Well, it starts off with Juma.
And I'm not going to put him in the water after.
Sure, yeah.
It does what you want.
Well, those kind of those base things,
which one do you like the best?
There's like Juma through, probably.
Juma is better, best, for its sensibility.
But I mean, Juma did what Juma wanted to do.
This is what I tell you.
This is what I tell you.
Probably you're expecting.
Yeah, because you're using the same technique.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I go on the right.
And also for me, I use mom.
Yeah.
No, absolutely.
I mean, and it's just fine.
If it does what you want it to like.
You're less involved.
Do I name your content?
I'm saying.
Or, uh, some more than any content.
No more.
Like, um, like, I mean, like, I just don't know how to do that.
I don't know how to do that.
Because rest.
Rest.
Rest.
Good.
Well.
But where rest was you?
It was hard.
What made it happen for Larry?
Well, I'm looking for that, maybe, a piece of stuff.
Well, for me, I'm actually really getting out of here.
I just like all the things around.
Right through like the back end.
But you can do that.
I mean, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The word first off, you know, I've been working on cold.
Uh, jubile, mom, wall.
I don't know if it's true.
I've been working on jubile.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The piece of stuff.
You might have, uh, fast, pretty low.
Is word first is confidence.
Is part of the, uh, jubile.
No.
It's great.
It's a lot of fun blogging.
Like a game or person.
You know, they're not bad.
Like jubile, jubile.
They're not bad.
It's just jumeless, specifically.
Like it's very difficult to extend.
If you once made really specific that plugin.
If you do the magic, what they've done, you know, that's great.
You know, that I, you are right.
If you want to extend, uh, probably a lot of people do a group call as a back end.
And then they just write, uh, the fact that they do a lot of things.
Yeah.
Everything in contradiction our number.
A couple sides they would use, uh, jubile for all their back end kind of management.
But they were praying forjma Skrač, the front annoying codified stuff.
But uh, I should point jubile was fine.
M biliyor сожал around.
And this job is a good thing for us.
I mean, you know, they use Verizon on phd right?
Yeah.
You know, so, uh, how long are you interested?
Just a backup of it, the name of that piece of software is EMC, so LinuxCNC.org has like all the information about that.
Is it EMC?
So there's a whole group of guys doing C and C stuff on it, right?
Who's Linux?
Yeah, those shoreline mills come with distro clinics right on it.
That piece of software.
Okay, I have a question. If in here, I'll close the tap.
That's in the Albra, I'll close the tap.
You close the tap.
No tap, tap.
What?
If I close the tap, so here I...
Yep.
And you close it.
And you want it back?
Yes.
A little trash can.
This one?
Yep, click on it.
There it is.
Hey, now that's kinda cool.
Because in Firefox, actually, if I close the tap, then it's here.
I probably have to write the line.
It tells me how to close the tap.
Yep.
And I close the tap.
You do the Albra by accident.
I had an article there.
Yeah, but it was too long.
I think it's too long.
I think it's Firefox.
In your history, don't they have a section recently closed tabs too?
I think if you look in history, it says recently closed and there's a list in there too.
So you can make sure...
Is there a place in opera you can turn off your lashes?
Plug in.
If you hit up 12, and just turn off the enable plugins.
You can't just turn off the flash.
You just have to make the enable all...
You can uninstall the flash plug-in.
No, I need to suck it real quick.
I got all these old things in the background running and they all take computer power.
All that flash bullshit.
Or you can uninstall the flash plug-in and install it again if you want it.
Yeah, I was thinking for something a little bit simpler.
Just a knob on the front of the computer you turn.
You want to push button computers and like...
Well, like a big button where you have to pop up.
It's 82.
Way too wide.
There were some things that you could get.
What was the...
There were little applet things that you could put...
And there were buttons that would like kill flash or something.
Like there were little applets that you could run by clicking.
I think that was like a bottom line.
I think that was in next game or something.
But that's Mozilla.
So it might work in Firefox.
But there were these...
What were those things called?
You basically set it up as a bookmark.
And if you clicked on it, it ran a little script.
Yeah, scriptlet or something.
I think that's what it was.
And you could kill Java.
You could kill Flash.
You could kill all animations.
There were a few things.
And it was just, you know, for whatever it was currently operating.
And then you could show me what the...
Here's another trick too.
It's kind of a dirty trick, but you can do it.
If you open up the system monitor and you find the...
I'll plug in right here.
Yeah, you right click on it.
And you can pause it.
Oh, you can pause that.
Now the plug-ins ain't going anywhere.
Okay, because I always just...
I know that I've got one.
You can actually stop it.
It actually pauses the process.
So you can pause any process on your PC.
But you could still go back and use Opera now.
It's just...
Yeah, it's just that now they're plugged in.
It's just that page forever.
Yeah.
Well, is that essentially what that little thing that...
No.
That he's doing when he...
What's the name of this thing?
I think that's going through Fire 5.
Yes, it's Fire 5.
What?
No script.
What?
No script.
No script.
It's turning the JavaScript off.
The most old Fire 5.
Right.
Again.
Okay.
The other thing that you can do is if you right click,
you don't do a while.
Are you an opera or are you an opera?
Yes, opera.
Okay.
You go to block content.
You can just block the...
The actual flash, the advertisement.
Yeah.
Or if it's only for specific sites.
There are a lot of sites that you want to get rid of specific aspects that you view a lot.
Just proud of this.
It's called the respond cable.
Okay.
A lot of people have bigger scripts.
That's about it.
You can also write your order where you can either get rid of a certain, you know, a box that contains an ad.
Or you can replace it with the individual.
Basically, there's JavaScripts that run automatically that can be linked down.
You can run that page.
Okay.
Yeah, that's not a good idea.
So what was this real...
Now I was just...
I just want to make a webber of it.
Like it's laughing at you and it kills all flash.
Something you can weld on there.
Yeah, yeah.
Something with tactile feedback.
That would be a big hammerhead.
Oh.
You know, they probably actually rush the wrench.
I thought that was a drill.
You know what?
With your work with electronics, you should be able to create a little panel that's got all these slots.
You can put that right on the front and you can...
You can have like a flash button.
You can have a little lever that you have to push.
You can have like something that you have to close the circuits.
And it would be your flash plug.
It would be a little wider than the first CPU power.
Now you can just put it all the way up and...
Well, that's not so funny.
The early AutoCAD stuff literally had a dongle that you had to stick into your serial port.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I think the serial...
Was there a encryption?
Yeah.
Well, whatever.
Not going to be the one.
You had what was it?
It was like $10,000.
Oh, whatever.
It was like $10,000.
AutoCAD.
You know, a thing that you needed to make the program run.
You needed to buy a program.
It's not to buy it to run it.
When you had it on your computer, you had it attached to stick to your serial port.
Or it would be a little piece of hardware.
It was a piece of hardware.
Yeah, it was a piece of hardware.
Yeah, it was a piece of hardware.
It was a piece of hardware.
Yeah, it was a piece of hardware.
You know, it's still got those on some of the PC's and the Star of the 2020 kitchen designer.
And the fun part, it is that you don't have to...
Well, the serial port is on these...
Oh, that one plugged into the parallel port.
Oh, wow.
It's not a parallel port.
I don't know about that.
Yeah, big one.
Wow.
Because do you want them asking?
Oh, it's bigger.
So I'm sure it costs my money.
All kinds of free cab stuff that's 10 times better.
Yeah, stuff.
Sure, of course.
That's interesting.
Is that it?
That's pretty much it.
Okay.
Well, I can do anything.
I can do it.
I can do it.
Yeah, I have so much free time.
What did you send the loose letter out on the screen?
Actually, actually, you know, that I have to do it on my thing.
It screws my tie.
Oh.
Do it Sunday.
Don't worry, but it's better for me.
You can't do it on Sunday.
That's why I'm throwing it out.
It's grass, running around.
Hey, it's going to happen.
Yeah, it's going to happen.
Yeah.
Well, it'll be like that.
It's growing together.
Well, when they grow up, we can have them.
Do you think so?
Absolutely.
No, they're kids for it.
The lawn in the newsletter.
What else?
Yeah.
Cool.
Any other discussion at all?
No, I didn't worry.
Roll ball.
I mean, the newsletter.
One thing I didn't forget, I have the 10 alpha installed lapro.
Yeah.
It's nothing extra special.
You mean the latest, greatest operative?
Yeah.
This is actually the alpha of the next version.
Yeah.
You probably want to be burned.
Yeah.
It's barely stable, except for their mail.
The mail tends to crash a bit.
Is the mail any better than the mail on the label or whatever?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is, actually.
That's why I installed it.
It does slip.
Is mail any better than a female?
No.
I don't even know what to say to that.
It's got inline spell checking.
And you can also do full HTML email.
Okay.
So a couple other features.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be significantly faster rendering pages.
I don't know.
It was already three fasts.
Yeah.
Everybody problem with that stuff.
Cool.
You know, I think I saw that there was a really exciting alpha release.
Yeah.
I was saying it was alpha.
It's a little unstable, but I can put up with it.
And I always have that many tabs open.
It's the only one I have.
Not a lot of tabs.
No.
I haven't gotten to four levels deep yet.
You know, by samples, my browser, all of my tabs disappeared.
Well, if you had an opera, you would have had that problem.
All the tabs would have came back and would have taken 45 minutes to start up.
Yeah.
Well, I thought that was something.
It does.
But if you have the second instance open and you close the first one and the second one.
And lastly, wipe your cache because it's saved the last instance.
Yeah.
It's pretty annoying.
So that's why we get two.
You can tell it to always save your history.
It is a history about history.
It's not where it was opened.
Yeah.
Then you got to go through the history and, okay, was this open?
It was the first one you opened the first time.
You know, open an access system.
You know, open an access system.
And if you just had it like that, it actually didn't access it either.
It's where I go to the page.
It's where I present.
It's where I present.
One thing I'd really like to play around with.
And I just haven't gotten the chance to get to it.
It's sessions and opera.
You can open up a whole bunch of tabs and you can save it as a session.
And then you can, you know, close your tabs, whatever.
And then you can go back to that session at any point.
You know, there was a tool, some kind of tool that you could save the pages.
The dynamic pages.
And then it was like reference tool.
Because pages are changing.
So then you can actually go on and you can say, oh, I still have a key here.
And you go to your reference.
Now, you wouldn't have the dynamic page cache somewhere.
I'm sure it was probably on the website somewhere here.
There was some author, some boom author who was welcome to call that.
So that's.
Shall we go on newsletter?
Can't wait.
Please.
There was news about VMware that they shoot open-source listings.
BDI client.
British Open.
Yes.
Yep.
I don't know exactly what they're going to say.
Like it might have been client.
One of the articles there was hardware with it.
So what was the hardware?
First, what I thought it was actually the player.
But then they were talking about this.
I don't know if these are actually what happened.
Can I run the client somewhere?
Yeah, I can play her for three months.
I can play her for three months.
Play her for three months.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Play her for three months.
Play her for three months.
Yeah, it's like a down-to-root.
Yeah, it's like a down-to-root.
Yeah.
It's like a down-to-root.
Yeah.
There's a clearly over there.
So then that was actually the news and the time when it came up was a dead vehicle.
I don't know.
I don't know.
And then basically it just looks at Happyable on the page.
Oh, there was a high spiel farmer leaving some, every day it's a kind of, well, if somebody
would buy my complete full-clunk, you'd need to offer his, even though I would only 20%
share that, for me, with 10% share of it, but that would be still nice, just kind of change
and if I don't like something I can leave right away. And I guess there was something issued
with 5.1, and I don't know exactly what he wants to do when I didn't read, that I already
didn't much, but he's studying off some of our company. So I was pretty much just saying
5.1 was, like, ready for production use and it wasn't whatsoever. There were a lot of
pretty critical products, like, really simple, like, it would limit, frankly, or, like, use
very simple things, frankly, and they could, you know, that it was a salad, please.
Well, that's what, when you are more involved in the business cycle. So, do we know what
he's going to do? I don't know. I don't know. Probably just go into our company and, you know,
there's a little bit. I don't, I don't see anything that I was talking about, Chris. I
think he's the other guy who was being so bright-prinator. Yeah, I think that he was actually
originator all the time. Yeah, yeah, he is. He was the other scab-a-lays. Yes, it's kind
of stripped down, it might have to be all organized, or, current-up technologies.
Yep, yep, yep, yep. And he's someone that's in London, I think. I think that he's going
to buy up their furnace and enjoy himself. And there was some kind of a, I didn't know that
the company's community is split to do different projects, but there was a news that they
have that merged it together. What have they always worked for? They've, they've always
always had split up. And the company's both the original one, the barrel split up, and then
they split up. They're all merged back, and then they split up. Comp is fusion. Yeah, and
here I read that they split again, and they created something to the name, something to the
company. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
