More driving on the top
They feel good just to be
Long in your SSI-V
But reach is global
My box is secure
This box too
Is global
My power is secure
I can have a deleted section
We're all in an exploitation
Is there a hold-up to your own mission?
I can make money going through the field
I can link through the small transformation lands
And we will have our wholeton-like convince
Because I hate to get fired by satellite
So I hate to get fired by satellite
So I can fight the stars when you ain't no joy
And so I can't get down your будет
I can kiss the wheel with my my family
With my my family
With my bad life
With my body, with my body, with my body
I can fly my bike with no seat attached
No seat attached, no seat attached
I can ride my bike with no seat attached
NO SEED ATTEECHED!
NO SEED ATTEECHED!
