It was a good day and welcome to Hacker Public Radio.
My name is Jay W and I've done some shows before on Hacker Public Radio and I'm doing
audacity at the internet cafe today so you all see there's a little bit of background
noise and I'm sorry if it's a little bit too loud.
So I'm adjusting the audacity, it looks a lot better right now on the audacity.
I've been a while since I did a show on the Hacker Public Radio and I'm even on podcasts
on my normal place.
I've been incredibly busy at work, I've been working in Prague and in Czech Republic
I've been traveling pretty extensively.
I'm still listening to the New Year's Eve show and I have to say that I was really impressed
with that New Year's Eve show and that tells you how far behind I am on the podcast
but like POPI I had to use an SD card and it's a big gig on my mind.
I'll transfer all my stuff on the G-Pod or put it there.
I was really impressed with the crunch bang and I'm going to try my best to call POPI and
I have a 701 also and also a 701 G4 and I really want to do a podcast about putting
crunch bang on the 704 and different things.
Now I tried to do Davien with Openbox.
I did my own config and my own config file and everything and I got it really lean and
everything but it you know in the end I could work it but it wasn't very wife friendly
and so I think crunch bang is a little one wife friendly maybe.
Of course I use this 701 mostly to do internet type things which is the browser.
So Google Docs you know all I need is a browser and there were no manager and maybe something
for a music streaming or something.
The important with that is that it's so small that it's absolutely totally portable.
Well the main topic that I wanted to talk to you all about the day was as you'll know
I'm a USB freak and I use USB sticks and USB cards and off a lot you know either to boot
or to run free or open source software and the place that I primarily do that is a place
called portable apps.com that's portable and then at the word apps and dot com and what's
happened at portable apps.com now is just they have a complete new suite have a version
and it's absolutely incredible it's got to be by far the best upgrade that I've ever had
and not on any of this right and so it what it does is it's you know it has a Dropbox plugin
now it has you know everything that you could possibly imagine but what it does now that it
didn't do in previous version version 10 it updates everything so you plug in your SD card
it comes up and it says would you like to update now right and we'll go through everything
and update right and what this means is that you know I work a lot of places and so I use the
SD card and on my work laptop I have a portable app suite and on my home PC for my life I also
have a portable app suite and so it completely keeps all that updated so completely you know all
the external things and before you know I used to have to have multiple you know like all the
browsers and everything on you know everything on there but now it's it's really fast it's actually
much much faster and the I mean when I say it has your favorite things you know it granted it
doesn't work on Linux I must use wine but it has everything imaginable right so you know you have
your your USB you know like I have an iRiver and if I plug in my iRiver my portable apps there
are there with my complete mail stack completely secure with all the passwords so if I'm at
internet cafe I don't have to put my passwords in on my hard drive or you can like that at all
and so it really has everything you know I couldn't think of really anything that just has
Leber office has Leber office it has open office and it's shooting it's shooting it's
like Abbeyboard I got a Dacity the Dacity that using right now it it organizes
it has sky built so that everything is built and it's just fun and you can organize everything
as everything is drag and drop so you build exactly the way you want it like I said the
updater is fantastic the themes and colors you can completely change it and the portable fonts
the portable apps that kind of supports the ability to carry fonts on your portable device
and use them with your portable software without needing to install them on a local machine so
now you're working with an important presentation I'll work on poster for charity God that
you can create as you like with the look and feel you like and not have to use the formats on
your machine so they have TFF open type OTF and true type collections TTC and it's one
one make up I download in it and if you have it before you don't have to download all the apps
it just goes through your apps and so these are the old ones and it'll update them freely and
freely for you and that's pretty much it now now not everything is free leiber there right
someone's just free all right some of the stuff is just free for instance they have putty
there and I use putty off a lot and one CP I use in my work a lot and so it's quite a
quite a nice thing now interestingly enough it works with cloud drive and drop box
right so you can actually install this on drop box have it come up as an application over the
internet from drop box and it's really really nice and they also now have the built-in app store
I haven't really done the built-in app store but I'm going to look for the built-in app store when
we get done I'm looking at it you can go through and you know put all your apps and everything you
know and with the price of 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte SD cards out you know store close it's really
really important to you know just go ahead and get that put that free software on you know
now really really if you really have somebody to have that now isn't going to
do a boot to for whatever reason I think the world is the biggest reason now and I have to do a
boot to is the that it doesn't do Netflix right and if you want any kind of streaming thing for
seven bucks a month you know I live in Germany so seven bucks a month plus the proxy it's got to
be the cheapest thing go on in Europe if you need English speaking TV so you need a Windows box
for that or a Google Chrome box for that or an Apple box for that and it doesn't work with
when it's not as yet there's I think there's a hacker page and it's quite difficult to get
so we're like to work with Ubuntu right now and so if you have a really clean to say a
a Windows starter or whatever on that book and you have your complete office suite right there
a complete everything you don't have to install anything you know but the very basic Microsoft
installs and and and boom you're off done you know done nothing nothing extra and if you
wanted to be there always just copy to hard drive you don't need any other stuff all right well
hey I'm going to go ahead and end this one if y'all need to get in touch with me it's a jwp5
at hotmail.com all right and this is jw and y'all have a fantastic day take care bye bye
