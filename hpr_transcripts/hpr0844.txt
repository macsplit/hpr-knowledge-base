What's the sound?
Okay.
C'mon.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi.
We're at Dr.
Guadalajan Beach troubles.
This is a dick-launcher room.
It's not a big room.
It's not a big room.
They can see you.
No, it's not.
They see you outside of that.
It's dicking down.
It's too much to look at.
I did take that before, a bit like Dick and Dom.
That's a tasty one, I'm drawing on the top.
That is recording by my wife.
Oh, is it?
That's what I'll be able to show you.
The following podcast was recorded a bar camp by Paul.
On October the 15th 2011, ladies and gentlemen, we present the flying handbag.
And no, we don't know what it's about either.
Alright, what are we doing?
Absolutely no idea.
Let's go around first and say who's here.
I'm Dan Lynch, hello.
I'm Pete.
I'm Dan.
Another Dan.
Wesley.
Vice-pounder.
Me.
I'm Tony Hughes.
Michael's almost known as Heed.
Heed.
Is that from the film?
Do you know the film I'm talking about?
What's the name?
No, you do.
What's the name?
Mike Mayasfilm?
It's so good content.
You don't know the Mike Mayasfilm.
So, I'm Mike, an axe murderer, it's cool.
Are you know what I'm talking about?
He's got his guy in it.
He's got a big man.
He's got a big Heed.
And the last one that he came from,
turned up to a new workplace.
You've got a big head.
Massive Heed.
The Coin of Heed.
Well get over it for like,
you just put up with it,
it's a bit of an average.
Like the dad keeps giving him abuse
because it's like he's saying,
get me a sandwich if you can't haul ya.
You're getting откranium?
Oh, you can put up with it.
Beasley is and it wouldn't rip some off a bit.
Yeah so we're!
So we were at Platte For Lucky and Brenda
was in the Black Fool хозяfolk
aa and was only at 10 we just questioned out.
He was a vacemaker.
are they gold and bag bar, gold?
Yeah, they're gold and toilets?
Heads boon.
Gold and black tiles.
Black tiles?
Toilets?
Doesn't show any stains.
I think it's black tile woodshew stains.
That's the experience, isn't it?
It's an interactive item.
I think they've got black silkshoots.
How do you know?
You invest here.
Yeah, so yeah, we're here at Barcan Blackpool and I'll tell you why.
me just like everyone go around and talk about what your favourite thing you've seen
or done so far is. I'll kick off if you want, or if you want. I found the guy's name
he talked very quietly, but the guy who did the Connect with Arduino and Little Mini
Hellcock, I think quite cool, although Aaron pointed out that it looks like he's doing
an nazi salute. Which I thought was quite interesting, but that was really cool, but
we all sat there waiting the whole session for him to go like that and make the thing
move. We talked for about half an hour and he couldn't really hear him. Can you do
the action against it? Well, it's really well. It does, doesn't it?
Can you do that? Can you raise your arm up?
Yes, there you go. For the benefit of the listener, I'm raising my arm.
It's raising his left arm. Yeah, that's it.
That's it. Yeah, there you go. So what's your favourite thing you've seen so far?
I think to be perfectly honest with you, because I'll sit in with you with the web thing.
Oh, yeah, web development. I quite enjoyed that. And it also lights the guy that was doing
the programming. I'm terrible with my memory.
Alan, was it? Yeah, it had the steam with the pole.
Yeah, I thought that was quite good. But as per usual, these sorts of things, you know,
I just enjoyed having a chat with people because we have managed to have a chat with some new
people that I didn't know. So that's been quite cool.
Definitely. Right? Other dance?
Yeah, so from my perspective, the error message is quite a fun session.
So you might have come from obviously with words of the title, was it?
Or in the sing club? Sing club? Yeah, it was pretty old-school stuff,
but it's been quite funny being behind enemy lines.
Yeah.
Because when you point out that certain contributors, some of you may know,
Dan works for Microsoft, so that's not me.
We have not done something.
I am wearing a wire to take that.
For the record. Yeah, yeah.
I don't quite understand why he's got all his money to pay for coffees and shit.
He's slipping up and in the coffee.
He's re-feeting coffees.
See, this is where I was when you record by the toilet, so just get in there with the bar,
just like that.
Let's watch your favourite things over.
And today, what I've enjoyed the most is the generosity of everyone involved.
They've given up time, money, products, everything, just made the day of success.
That's the shop answer, your proper thoughts.
For us, that erred message.
Talk to my own and not back on blackboard.
Enjoy the erromessage.
We're coming from a long time PC user.
It's good to see older erromessages like Sinclair Spectrum,
which is something everyone can experience of.
I was always a Commodore guy.
Yeah, I was a Commodore 64.
Commodore 64.
Commodore 16, I add.
We had a ZX81, so I'm a Spectrum.
I made a Commodore 64, and we used to go around there to play a game called Airborne Ranger.
That was about the most exciting game.
There was a Transformers game that I thought was amazing, and was a killer.
Oh, there's Alexa.
I think Nunequan had a nice presentation.
And all she could get there was just trying to go around, hit the button, and then transform.
It turned into a car, or a car, and I'm back into a robot.
Oh, it's pretty cool.
Sorry, Les.
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
Sorry, so here's the toilet.
I'm going to chat.
Yeah, that's all right.
How's it going?
Because I'm going to kind of interview you a bit now.
Because you're kind of involved in the whole organisation, so how's it going for you?
It's gone really well.
155 people confirmed that we're coming today.
And from looking out from here.
We've not been many people after that.
We've not been many.
How does that compare to previous years?
One 20 last year, and about 40 to 50 years previous.
So I think it's gone really well.
Interesting thing for me is I was here last year.
And although there may have been last people last year, the people here this year are different.
They're not all the same people.
Okay, some of the same people here.
But there's quite a lot who are different this year, so it's almost like expanding more.
Because if all that, if it didn't just the same group of people plus a few more, that'd be quite different.
Even better.
There's quite a lot of them the first time.
Yeah, that's a lot of them.
Brilliant.
Yeah, I love that.
That's my bag that is I love that.
So new people, new faces.
Yeah.
But you've also seen talks that have been conducted today by children.
Yes.
10 or 12 of you are all loved out there.
Do you talk on programme events?
Of course.
Can't say anything about somebody.
They've got older than children.
Mentlations.
It's terrible.
So what's it saying about Blackpool?
From a true origin.
They just said recently that Blackpool, do you see the survey?
Blackpool's got the most expensive accommodation in the country.
Relative to income here.
The cost of living in Blackpool is higher in turn than anywhere else.
I do not see even as it's castle.
Yeah, as it's castle.
The fire at the cannons.
Cool. So, Tony, what's your favourite thing so far?
Waking him up at court past seven this morning.
Oh, that's it.
Can we take that?
We have to roll out a window to be the risk.
Rock him on the door.
Yes.
No, I think my favourite.
As usual, I never get to any of the talks at least.
Because I ended up talking to so many people.
Like you said, just talking to people.
Networking.
Talking to people who don't know what a bar comes about.
Comfort people.
Hey!
That's it for us.
Comfort people.
It drives me stuck.
Comfort people.
I think that's that fella's helicopter again.
He's out there going.
He's not turning.
No, he's not turning.
I'm turning off.
That was really cool.
Are you doing that?
Thank you very much.
That was quite funny.
Anyway, that helicopter, Sorky, is still going.
I know that's what he's saying.
So, talking to you, pretty cool.
Yeah.
Me, pretty?
Yeah.
It's time.
Actually, I didn't know you were about that.
You can't have at least you.
I didn't know you were about that.
You can't have at least you.
I think it's for the trackways.
It's a lot of people.
A lot of people.
Yeah.
Sorky, you know, we've had sort of cut into your time.
As I said earlier, you know,
there's just that many people there.
You know, I try to do talks and meet people,
and Matt, who you all know, I mean,
he didn't even get to see a single talk,
because he spent all his time socializing.
Socializing.
Socializing.
Yeah, networking.
Yeah, networking.
And like you say,
and the thing he's about,
like, OK, especially, is, you know, there's,
there's only so much time.
And if you spend half an hour talking to that person
and now I'm talking to this one,
you're bound to be somebody.
So yeah, it's a real shame.
So yeah, I'm glad to meet you.
Yeah.
The other thing.
Ubuntu 1110.
Oh, yes.
Just successfully installed it on my ASA response.
Right.
It'll make it job.
Early impressions.
Early impressions.
Actually, a bit more impressed than 11.4.
Because it wasn't quite as tweaked,
but it seems to be all right in the moment.
The fact that Unity actually works now.
Yeah.
It does look improved.
Yeah.
John, the nice guy was showing me on his,
he's got only laptop.
Yeah.
1110.
And he was showing me the new changes to Unity.
And it does look good,
but I still can't stand that universal menu.
That's the only thing I really, really don't like about Unity,
so that's stupid.
That's what I'm thinking.
That's things.
I'm just installed on a computer for a friend.
And basically, I've turned the unit off
for the boom back on the normal desktop.
That's the first time I wouldn't use that.
And it's in the case of, well, keep them on note,
and at least they've got some sort of...
Unfortunately, 1110.
You have not got that option.
No, you're not really.
No, no, no.
You've got it by default.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
So you're going to be able to...
I'm going to be able to...
I'm going to be able to...
Using the bungee, sorry.
Using the bungee or extra bungee.
What's under the other...
That's kind of a bungee doing in a tablet space, then, for...
Well, basically, the Unity interface will be what...
Yeah, there's going to be for tablets.
It will be going on touch, then.
Yeah.
So what do you have, you've got any OEM providers
or that are going to be signed up for...
Well, you really just get information now.
I haven't personally got any...
No, I've not.
Just like...
Yeah, now this...
You're not changing it, don't you?
Yeah, well, canonical...
The adult of it comes with a hand.
Yeah, I bought a Dell laptop with a bungee on it.
My Dell mini-10 came with a bungee on it, yeah.
But I bought it specifically that model from Dell
because it came with a bungee,
because I wanted to support the whole idea of it.
I bought it because it was cheap.
There you go.
And then you've got a real zid in bed.
You've got a real zid in bed.
That's not real zid in bed.
Sounds healthy.
All right, I'll have that.
In that case, we should be selling loads, if people...
I don't...
But the trouble is, we see that...
I mean, you've got a good thing there.
I mean, that is our mindset.
That's not a Windows user's mindset.
A Windows user's mindset.
No, I mean, as soft as this.
Well, as soft as it says, I don't think a Windows user
would look at an Ubuntu machine and go,
I can wipe that and stick Windows on.
Yeah.
Because we all know that people have got licenses at home
and whatever, and they can't do it.
And yet, we, on the flip side of that,
we're quite happy to do it.
We'll go, well, I've gone ahead, Windows 7 Starter thing.
And I'll wipe that and I'll put Ubuntu on over there.
Yeah, but you've got in the average person in the street
going to a computer store.
We're going to want an operating system on there.
And what's unfortunate with Windows, is that enough?
I think that probably in computer stores,
I'll give you an example of PC world.
They're incentivized as a business to sell.
Yeah, so you...
Actually, I'll wipe up on that.
Windows, you know...
There's no one there in Ubuntu that's saying...
Yeah, there's Ubuntu, you know?
Yes.
Where it's dangerous, girls?
Yeah, that's another 20% of that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And that's where I'm going to sell.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm not showing it.
I mean, you know, I...
I never hide that at all.
I mean, that's always a bottom line.
But we're at the same level.
But you've got in the PC world,
they're going to try and sell you the most expensive PC kit.
God, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Especially the Uncommissioned.
What are you going to use it for?
You're going to use it for serving the weapon,
doing a bit of photo, I'd say.
Yeah.
And so you want a little just to...
Oh, oh, oh.
Just to just to quickly cut, you know.
I mean, Dan and I,
and that's Dan from Microsoft today.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Microsoft.
Microsoft.
Yeah.
I mean, we've had this conversation,
and I'm serious, and I think I've said this before,
it is an absolutely brilliant game to play.
Going to PC world.
Stan next to one of the South people,
but do not say a word.
You spoil it.
If you say anything,
you stand there and listen.
You will laugh all afternoon.
Yeah.
But then you've got a bite of tongue to you.
Well, you've got a bite of tongue to put to you.
You've got a bite of tongue to put to you.
You've got a bite of tongue to put to you.
You've got a bite of tongue to you.
It was really fun because I was speaking to Dan last weekend,
and he said, God, he said,
I won't say what he did,
but he went into PC world.
And he said, you know how he said,
I was listening to him, you're right.
And I said, I know, I said,
it's great into time,
and to just stand there and listen.
So they sell to me.
After the session set,
they tell people it's unbelievable.
Yeah.
And she tells the person,
got more compute experience in that sense.
I'm sure I'm going to set something up.
So you've got to listen to a bite of tongue to them.
You turn it on.
You do what you need to do.
You turn it on.
But how he said that, you see,
I mean, I'm just as good as that.
So, because that's what I do.
But I went into, like,
he said, well, you're right there.
Oops.
And a couple of years ago it was.
And I was looking for a turn to cartridge
for the laser printer.
And a little bit of the laser.
Yeah.
And I couldn't see him.
So I went up to one of the assistants.
And she told me to the end,
you had to cartridge it.
I'd specifically said,
have you got to turn to cartridge it?
Yeah.
And she told me to the end,
get cartridge it.
I bought an EPC a couple of years ago
from PC world.
And as we were buying it,
it's this couple talking about the EPCs next to me.
And salesman goes,
oh yeah, yeah.
Those EPCs,
they were on some of them called
linux.
You can't get word on that.
Oh, right.
When you go and jump on his head,
you go, funny girl.
Right.
How bloody can't it send in?
Oh, I want to send in an email.
We can use Linux.
Do you mean they can't sell you word for that?
No.
Yeah.
Well, that's what it means.
Yeah.
I mean, you're coming on to another tangent there.
I mean, what do a lot of shooters need?
They don't need a lot really.
There's something to send me now.
A bit of a bit of writing.
And that's it, really.
Look at the Chrome box.
Yeah.
That's all online.
You can do whatever you want to.
That's what I was told.
So, it's from a Ubuntu.
It's like a Ubuntu.
I think it runs Chrome.
It's like a full screen, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Let's just show it to a 600.
You've got a new Kindle.
Have you not read the review of one of the guys
better than he's at it?
And he's actually going to leave you a bit.
How he found it?
And stuff like that.
No, I've not read that.
It's a scratch,
because you said he got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've got to send it out to him.
Is it right?
Yeah.
Use it for a couple weeks.
Maybe that's also going to get usage.
He says.
Normally, you have pre-locked on what you can do.
But these ones.
And if the button is switched.
But if you develop a mode.
Yeah.
And you can do what you want with it.
He says, it was awesome.
You've got used to working with it.
So, one night when his internet went down.
And all sort of.
Yeah.
You've got to do it here.
Yeah.
He's like, well.
He says.
Hardware.
Yeah.
If you're a Google user, you know,
heavily use Gmail and the docs and stuff.
Yeah.
Then it's a great tool for you.
And then the internet goes down your book.
Yeah, your book.
Some things on it.
Yeah.
I thought Chrome OS had given you the ability to save stuff
to hard drive.
If you wanted to.
I would hope so.
Yeah.
You can't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you wanted to.
I would hope so.
You can't.
Yeah.
I thought I'd heard that.
A friend of mine used one recently, the Chromebook,
because they've got one in the Doze Liverpool office,
because there's one of the Google employees there.
And this is Larry.
He said to me, I was borrowing his laptop or something
to do a thing that I needed to run a project or something.
And I said to him, well, I've got a spare laptop here
if you need to use it.
And he said, oh, no, it's OK.
We've got a Chromebook in the office.
I'll work on that.
And then about an hour later, I get a phone call.
Right.
There's Chromebook shite.
Can I have that?
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I'll do Google that going for the main target
is the average person.
That's what's going on.
It's fine as a concern.
It's a low-cap Facebook.
Well, they're also going into enterprise market as well.
They're trying to get skills and businesses.
You said, OK.
It was a month.
Yeah.
Well, three-year contracts.
But you get full hybrid support on all the things.
Yeah.
And schools will get $20.
Yeah.
So in that environment, then, yeah.
Because in the contract, you're on the network that way.
And people are not the same.
True.
Other than that, it's going to be big.
Well, they've got the cloud as well, Google, too.
As you say, in PC World, Apple or Microsoft or whatever,
we'll give the sales money.
I think Google's got the money to say,
you sell some Chromebooks.
I'll give you a copy.
One of my customers, do you know how to use that?
Right.
I think they've got users.
Gmail users.
Remain nameless.
Google apps, is it?
Or just Gmail.
They use Gmail, but they use Google app.
It's a bit of a convoluted kind of process.
They're good going on in there.
Look at the SharePoint Google sites.
Right.
Office 2010 and Google apps.
It's a bit of a mixed bag, really.
And one thing I've learned with them is Google.
As much as I've met it, they're not really the enterprise
ready organization they say they are.
Because they've not got the support to back that all of that stuff up.
And I'll give you an example.
I was talking with Pete.
They need Gmail to access their, sorry,
they need Chrome to access their Gmail offline.
The functionality.
And they was told.
Now, I couldn't find this anywhere on the internet because I looked.
But they were told that they had to be on the latest stable release
of Chrome to be supported.
Right.
Now, they have a release every six weeks, don't they?
Yeah.
So what that means now is they've got a management of all then pushing Chrome
out of all of their devices every six weeks
to stay in supported,
the supportability lifecycle.
And that was that to them.
Not very difficult to digest, you know.
A lot of enterprises said the same about Firefox, aren't they?
Right.
We're doing that.
We're doing that.
We're doing that.
We're doing that.
We're doing that.
That's great for the consumer market to say, yeah, every six weeks,
you're getting the features.
We're there for the enterprise.
But what one said about the product?
Yeah.
But they were going to actually bring that.
Yeah. The ones who've changed it to monthly release.
That's quite impossible.
Yeah.
I mean, we discussed that on CDTRS there.
I mean, that's exactly what we discussed on our last episode
and the fact that the release seems to be coming more and more
and more regular, which I'm totally against.
I mean, I didn't explain myself well enough on that.
Yeah.
I mean, actually, it's a rolling update.
Yeah. Well, this is what I said.
Well, I should have really done.
I sort of blurred the lines really between releases and updates,
which I shouldn't have done, because what I was saying,
really, I think you should be having six already.
I mean, even a 12 month release on the device.
Yeah, I so.
Properly.
But you've got your normal updates coming out.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm going to say service pack.
Yeah.
Every 12 months is the latest thing.
Oh, correct.
Yeah.
So short of that time.
Or we go the other way, and we just go to a rolling release,
which, but then again, this wouldn't,
then you would have a problem, most of these admins
in a business environment will probably have a,
in a sense, a problem with that,
because they'd have to basically run two servers.
They'd have to run a production server and a testing server.
Well, I've been doing it.
I mean, three or four environments.
Most of the SMEs don't, man.
But, you know, I'm struggling to get my main strategy.
Most of the SMEs are buying a server,
and they're going to have two.
I mean, we are, we work, we are an interact.
I mean, I've sort of semi-discussed it with you down,
but like, we're finding lots of them there,
are going to have to virtualize that,
actually, simply because it's a cost save.
Yeah.
But the ones to be NHSN,
almost, they want a system that can be installed
and stay on there for four or five years.
Yeah.
It's a mean to them.
Yeah.
Because they don't want all that.
They're coming around every single year.
Yeah.
There's lots of good other bad contracts.
Yeah.
All government.
Come on in.
Instead of sitting.
You're going, you will have a minimum spot for this.
Anything that they want that you do and want,
but you've got a minimum spot this.
I want to be NHSN in 2005.
And then we still running Windows 2000.
Yeah.
That does surprise me.
No, but they're winning.
Yeah.
The only thing I want to point out is that
they're growing a business application.
Yeah.
And it's going to be supportable on different platforms.
I know you've got a lot of internet.
It's an instant call back for everything else.
86, until next 16.
Even Microsoft want to now buy that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's still pushed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's that much infrastructure built on that.
Yeah.
The kind of thing.
It costs them too much to be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
An XP as well.
Yeah.
I mean, that will go in 2014.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We need to go into that side, I can see.
Yeah.
We need to go into it, if you'd like.
We need to go into that side.
It's certainly something important.
On one big roll.
And then some stuff.
That's very important.
What would you do?
It's definitely important.
Yeah.
Of the support, anyway.
One big open site, yes.
There was remind of our Facebook.
Well.
It was kind of clever.
Well, definitely.
But from a few Para etwas,
they mean what does it do show to you now?
Okay.
The guy said to me, he said he's definitely got XP on it, isn't it?
No, I mean, yeah, anyway, because I want X7 shit.
No, he's definitely got XP on it, isn't it?
So I mean, I'm still selling now in 2011.
I'm still selling Baishunis and laptops with XP product.
Yeah, I think people are using it.
Linux has started to learn from it.
Maybe the ordinary user doesn't want to change it.
Yeah, most people have a good point.
That's a really valid point.
Maybe it's on this point of view now.
All the current people who are using XP now
is what they've got time and school.
So that's what we know now.
So now Windows 7 and 8 get into the school,
which I've got the issues with myself.
That them kids are learning that.
My time there in the workforce.
That'll be.
Oh, Windows 8.
What you see, there's two valid points there.
I mean, just to explain on what you've just said there,
I mean, that's quite a valid point in the sense that,
maybe is that something that should be looked at of just having
a stable release and concentrating on date
and what have you for it,
rather than keep messing around every six or 12 months.
Would it be a valid course to say I don't know?
And you're quite right as well.
We've, I mean, I know some schools do,
but not a lot of schools teach Linux.
But there's another thing.
Should, yeah.
For example, my nephew is being given the time
so forth he's going to be on the next year,
and he's from a case of our institution, Microsoft Word.
Right.
That's the 19th.
Yeah, what is it?
Why does it?
That's the National Curriculum.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Why does he need to know Microsoft Word at 7 when he can be
introducing a word processor?
Yeah.
Let's just, let me text editor as well.
So, you know, I think once you get the basis of the word
processor, you know, whether it been word or the
lever office or whether it be whatever,
he can make his own mind.
Yeah.
It's got to be about principles and the principles of using it
rather than the actual specific.
This is how you use word, whatever.
I think the problem is air education system,
certainly as far as I'm concerned here in the UK,
to a certain extent, if you hear me out,
that they should have turned out robots.
And what I mean by that is they will go,
there you go, there's a Windows and Box,
and this is Microsoft Office.
So, that's how you use word,
and that's how you use Excel.
So, that robot can leave the factory
and can go into an employment environment and use that product.
But that's what the university is saying at the moment,
when they get students come in to do computer science
and to do IT,
that they don't, all they know is Microsoft.
Correct.
They don't know a broad range of technology
and I remember my girls at primary school going in
down to sleep, sleep, and down to sleep to school.
And going in and one of the teachers there sort of going,
oh my god, this new thing keeps school out in the office
and the girls weren't even using that for years.
And he was like, oh, what?
And of course, some others were like, what's this?
And they did, I mean, I've been in a couple of cities
and going to cities.
No, I can't see a problem why they can't.
I do have work, I can't understand why schools can't
do stuff.
Yeah.
Expertise as well.
Yeah.
There's plenty of expertise on the market.
You know, when we go home,
it's a school, if it even has IT support,
a lot of it, push it out.
But does it's going to have one to people?
Yeah.
So if you're saying, well, okay, I need a Windows
and a Microsoft expert boss, I'll need someone
who's savvy with Linux Unix, whatever.
You know, it's a very difficult kind of position
to fill in the skills, but exactly.
Exactly.
So there won't, though, they'll always stick
to the cost of effective.
And then on the pay licence.
He's all over the world.
I can't just subsidise quite heavily.
I'll always pay.
I can't make those things.
Go to hell and go to hell and go to hell and go to hell.
Yeah.
Just agree with what it's saying.
That's it.
Just have fun with the source.
That's it.
Yeah.
It's a, yeah, it's going to be a...
You got to be honest, I see how we know it.
I mean, I don't know if any of you,
I've been done certainly.
But I don't know if any of you guys saw,
post-laced late last night on G+, and apparently,
Leigh Roberts now is going to be compatible
on Android, Mac.
Oh yeah, the cross-buck out of front.
Oh, on Android as well, that'd be good.
Now that is something that that promotes.
And we all know that Pete's got funny views on open sales
and then it's and then winders have got nice, whatever.
But I promote cross-bucketability in the sense
that I take the view
that I don't see that you require any more of a skill set
to put Firefox on a Windows box than having IE9.
You don't require any more of such a skill set
to have Leigh Roberts on there as you've got open office.
So I take a sort of almost like a passive view of it.
I don't, I'm not, I would like to see a Linux box in any outro,
but I'm quite happy to take the passive path
and do a creepy scenario.
But I've always said, I don't want to see Microsoft go anyway.
Yeah, never ever.
But I think that really choice is what it's all about.
Yeah, that was the old choice.
Yeah.
Projects, philosophy, weren't they?
Yeah.
If you're not going to get people to change platform,
at least if you choice, I think as well.
I listen to a podcast recently of Windows on, I mean, obviously.
And it did a really nice tribute to Steve Jobs
and for the record, I mean, all Microsoft offices
had their Microsoft, like, half-max,
eight of them all week worldwide.
Respecting the one thing Steve Jobs said.
Yeah, one thing that Steve Jobs says,
and I thought it was quite admirable, he says,
happened this was years ago before I parted on Apple's releases,
one from the notion that Apple must go their head is bruised
to succeed Microsoft has to lose.
Yeah.
They need to go away from that notion
and to be fair to them, you know, they look where they are.
But Microsoft bailed Apple out at one time.
A deep ill gate, such a poor plan.
In 1990s, you needed the competition there.
Yeah, well, you know, it's various views of them.
But we all do, but I've always remembered that anyway,
as far as I'm concerned, we need competition
because honestly, you know, you will get bad code
as coming in, slopping us.
We will have nothing to bench,
I mean, I've said this before,
so I'm just going over all ground again,
but we'll have nothing to benchmark against them.
That's what I always push for.
And I don't care what Microsoft does or mech does
or whatever you're doing, it seems good, right?
If you look at any monopoly,
they usually turn out to be chite in the end,
you know, the quality goes down.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, I'm talking about, you look at like BT
and people like that.
I mean, how many of us have had a angry kind of confrontation
with BT over them being shit, doesn't it?
And the post office and stuff like that.
What's that recently?
You need competition.
On a failure and then time network went down.
Yeah.
I mean, the car to the average.
The average in us was that.
I mean, area because it's that.
A little fire in, I think it was solio.
Mm-hmm.
And half of the UK went down.
Was it half?
I think I had 30%.
Yeah.
Well, it was nearly half, nearly half.
But what I find interesting about that,
going up a slightly off the piece, supposedly,
email was invented in the event of a nuclear war,
so that we could still have a way to communicate.
But we have one small fire in solio and half.
It comes to a risk.
Yeah, yeah.
If you got a network designed for free,
then yeah, it could root around the problem.
Obviously, they've messed up somewhere in the design.
I think it's just, you know what?
Let's be frank.
I mean, you know what I'm saying, success is clear.
Obviously, we've been 95 and 99.
And I do take the position for granted.
You know, you really do.
And that's why I think, you know,
we're just slightly really spoken in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, he was playing very, very, very good.
Yeah.
And this is just a clear one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
As I say, I mean, that, you know,
just to re-retro at the point,
I just, I cannot understand why he's a skulls,
universities or whatever.
Or not at least in stalling alternative browsers
and in stalling packages.
You've never seen those three?
To me that's a big trick.
I'm happy with that.
It can't be easy.
My ability to talk to them.
If you're actually on a computer that ordinary students could access.
It was more in the labs.
Yes, yeah.
Because if you got in a school,
where you've also got internet explorer and Firefox thing,
that's two browsers you've got control,
where at least if you're on the internet explorer,
and if you lock that down,
there's some little diamonds going and doing stuff.
Yeah.
Most of the labs run through a proxy anyway.
Yeah.
You know.
But I mean, to me,
that's my happy victory.
I know others would like to see.
They'd like to see news reports like,
yeah, I don't know.
The Italian government has taken on 800,000 new bunch of boxes
for the police folks.
Well, yeah, this code.
But our more interesting if you turn around and say it's like,
yeah, they've decided to use a little bit of a profits.
I mean, a little bit of profits or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because, you know, I think,
I think that's the solution.
That's the solution.
The solution.
I think.
Oh, Joe.
You're not sounding now, are you?
Yeah.
One careful owner.
The one careful owner.
Yeah.
I would have been used.
Yeah.
Grazie.
I've got a question.
Go and max relief roughies in all the roughies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What did, you know, be the time for the open office brand
to be allowed to be that to die off?
So everyone sees the monthly roughies now,
and you've just mentioned the area one.
Yes.
It's going to cost platforms.
But what you've got to remember there, it is that,
to a certain extent, you're talking about two separate markets
because obviously, open office now is going into the,
for a little bit, the paid format, isn't it?
And labour is still being used by our own source.
I would love to see labour office become the dominant product.
But you've got to remember that obviously,
open office has got the backing of some.
So...
Would it actually be a bit awful?
Oracle.
Sorry, Oracle.
Not Oracle.
Maybe that is what we were talking about.
Oracle.
Oracle.
Oracle.
Yeah.
Oracle has said the novel to us.
Yes, it is.
Oracle's not at an office.
But it should be completely.
But open office did have a commercial round.
Yeah.
It used to have the,
a whole star office.
The star office.
Our office is a good product, you know.
I used that.
I used that.
Did I lose it?
I liked it time.
Yeah.
Ducky time, yeah.
We're not supposed to hate it.
No.
I think, um, I mean...
I was there.
We were out there.
We were out there.
I was there.
I used that star office.
That's coming back to our conversation.
I used to be a rubbish.
I remember we used key balls and bolts.
I remember when we...
We used key balls and bolts.
I remember Star Office.
I remember it.
But I think the thing now is,
I was quite annoyed when...
Not annoyed, that's a bit of a strong word.
But I was quite, you know,
upset when they forked open office and made lever office
just from a point of view
that we were just getting to the point where
some of the general public knew what open office was
and then we were going to change the name.
And now nobody's got it.
We've gone back to square one.
And now we've got to go and tell everyone what lever it is.
That seems to be the rules of the game, though.
Yeah, but...
The kind of one outside of the non-experiency says,
oh, I need to get a free office program.
Open office.
Yeah, they don't still do.
Yeah.
But it's taken 10 years to get to the point where people know
what open office is and go,
you've got open office.
So it's been easy on you.
But what about the tarot?
She's good, perhaps.
Yeah, well, that's it.
Yeah, I like that.
That's what you end up.
Yeah.
It's forked off of this for wine.
Yeah, it just seems good.
The weekend father, right?
He said, right.
He said, uh, it does seem like you've got a copy of
Office Surrounder, yeah.
That's a...
No, I haven't, but why?
He said, basically, I'm trying to do something,
but a drinking club is part of.
A drinking club?
Yeah, it sounds like a good club.
That's a good club.
That's a good club.
All right.
He said, well, it's...
No, the password.
The office is being out of giving.
It's not working no more.
So it's a right.
So basically, you have a demo version,
and obviously he's running out.
Yeah.
So you've got a copy of it.
No.
But maybe it's this lever office.
It's pretty much the same from your point of view.
Go and install it.
On that week, we're going out.
He came down over there yesterday.
It's been awesome.
Yeah.
It's free.
Yeah, it's free.
But I approve of you, Dan Lynch.
You know, that's a valid point.
It's such a valid point.
Yeah, I got really upset when that happened.
But from another point of view, I found out since...
I'm not involved in the lever office development
or open office development.
But I found out that...
So, although it was under the CCDL
and it was open source and the rest of it,
Sun still exerted quite a strong influence over open office
and a lot of the developers were frustrated.
The ones who didn't work for Sun were frustrated
because they couldn't get things done.
Because Sun would kind of find ways of saying no.
You know, if they didn't like what they were doing.
And now, lever office is kind of accelerating in development
because there isn't a big company going...
No.
Yeah, it's actually a true kind of open project.
But to hopefully to redress what you were saying about
is taking ten years for open office to get to the fore.
Maybe with the new ability of lever office being on Android
and what you...
Maybe that...
Because we all know that there's explosion of Android answers.
This is huge.
So maybe it'll only take five years.
Maybe.
Maybe not even that.
Yeah.
At a certain point, no.
Where does it become a problem for Google?
That they're trying to push Google Docs and all these other things.
And they're going to get to a point where they go hang on.
We don't want this lever office stuff.
Because that's competing with our product.
Well, I've been thinking about that myself in actual fact.
I mean, with the greatest wooden world,
how much longer is Google going to be prepared to have
far for these apps?
Yeah.
That's true.
Because there's loads of apps now.
I mean, it's just going to compete for their business.
And it's all very well to wave the community flag
and compete.
Just put both hands up and did the little finger explanation.
That's a bit of a podcast.
But it's all very well to have this community attitude.
But there is a bottom line to be met.
And the bottom line is, well, you know,
we've got a free application that's basing.
It's doing the same with the application that we want to charge for.
And we've got the power to do it.
So let's kill that out.
Is that a train set?
Yeah, it's that train.
Correct.
I mean, I like that set.
I like that set.
It's that train set.
We'll play over here.
We like it.
How are we doing for time?
Sometimes.
Not a problem for battery life is.
Okay.
Well, this one's going to die as well.
So very quickly.
I've got a question for everyone.
I have quite an interesting experience, isn't it?
We're talking about office sweeps.
Yeah.
We're talking about office sweeps.
Does anybody know what a dot pages file is?
A dot pages extension?
Oh, no.
Yes, that's it.
Is that a smacking?
Yeah.
There you go.
I didn't know that.
I was writing an article for some publication.
And I sent it to them.
And they sent it back.
I sent it.
Yeah.
I'm going like.
Yeah.
It's like.
I'm going like.
Yeah.
I'm going like.
Yeah.
I'm going like.
Yeah.
So yeah.
I was writing an article for this editor.
That's got that.
Yeah.
And I sent it to her.
And I sent it in.
I converted it to dock dock.
Because I knew if I sent it to her, no.
Yeah.
She'd go, what the hell is this?
But I wrote it.
You know, we can offer a sort of labor officer to say.
And I sent it to her.
And then she sent it back to me.
And said, I've made some amendments.
And there was this file attached to court with so and so dock pages.
And it wasn't opening Google Docs, which I found interesting.
Oh, it was opening Google Docs.
But it wouldn't be exported to any other format.
All right.
I got it downloaded.
It opened it in open office.
Sorry, labor officer.
Keep it in there.
So yeah.
It goes back to the branding.
Yeah.
And I can't.
That had trouble with it.
Yeah.
And I thought to myself, why?
You know, after all these years of like before, against Microsoft,
and we don't want a different thing, we want a standard format.
Are we letting Apple get away with doing all this as well?
Well, this is it.
I mean, that's, I mean, you know, you know, my feelings.
And it's, you know, it's like, isn't it?
I mean, it's easy target.
It's Microsoft really.
But as I've said, I've said, I've said, oh, it is as well.
You know, there's this Mac.
And it's good.
Well, I mean, you know, Google's not a nice company.
No.
No, no, no.
They're not sweet.
It's all very well.
They're not.
They'll be able.
Well.
That's me and you, bullet-through, I don't know.
You've come for the interview.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
It's open and can't do.
Yeah.
So.
You've got to leave the literature.
Well, if you did a recording of Blackpork, you could just play it back to you.
You know.
I mean, don't be evil.
Or don't get caught.
But yeah.
Well, that's the, yeah.
So, you know, I mean, I see, I see very,
like you so.
Very few complaints about Apple formats.
Yeah.
Well, something else I've noticed is, you know, the EU brought in this law that all new phones
are to have a microSD slot on them.
Oh, for charges.
Yeah.
I saw a thing being to get rid of all the different charges.
Yeah, which is fantastic.
Yeah.
Which phone hasn't.
The iPhone.
And they're just allowed to get away with it.
Yeah.
And nobody's challenging them.
Because I can now move to wireless charging.
I don't think that's what I've been.
I don't think that's what I've been.
I don't think you have to do it.
Really?
No.
I think they can let them go.
No, they can.
Because they've got iPhones and they can do this.
I'm saying you will have it.
It's just a good life time.
And everyone's gone fine.
Hmm.
What's hard because it makes sense.
So I think the basic point here is standards are good.
I think whatever platform you use.
It would be saying, be at Windows, Mac, Linux, I don't know if I can be a Steve.
Whatever you want.
Having some kind of standards where I can send you a file and you know what it is,
and your programs could be created.
Yeah, it's the most important thing
It's perhaps that tribal thing then everyone's going to go well my tribe doesn't want to do it
I want to do it this way. Yeah, but you can't oh
I mean, you know, we have I mean we have standards in place for
For most things where you you know for the where yeah, whatever. I mean, you know to be honest with me, but he
maybe
maybe
The open source community needs to
Take a little step down and accept
A standard that is being set
I won't say by Microsoft, but based on now that comes. Yeah, that comes by some of the else
Yeah, that comes from someone else rather than from our community
Because we're all very big on going what are the issues of how you should do it?
Actually, and maybe we should eat a bit of humble pie and go okay for enough
We'll accept that standard
And I don't know what to teach so as per you can keep standards, but open them up so you can go right
This is a document file. It's on translate since I
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that's been tried, doesn't it, but it hasn't really worked that well
Quite a field though. Would you want your competitors to know that you've managed to figure out an easier way to compress the data within the file
You know they can use it
Talking about file formats. I don't send a
Um, Microsoft the works document
I got quite pissed off. Yes, they haven't sent me this file and I posted it on twitter
Just been sent to dot pages file didn't know what it was and then somebody some smart alley replied to me
Oh, it's the new WPS
So since since those keeps looking and
All right, so um anybody got any points they want to make before we go
My favorite part since I was on that. Oh, sorry
It's because you stuck behind me and I can't see you no matter
I see you've been speeding the auction and the
Requins the
He's affluent southerners. They've paid a nine quid. They're all right. I had to pay nine quid
The fella wouldn't said he didn't know what bark and
I won't step it. Yeah, you'll bury you in the
I think that you asked him did he accept the hub catch
I won't step on your point here, but yeah, basically what happens you're supposed to tell the people at the car park
That you come in for bark and blackpool and you get in for three pounds
So I drove up and I said to the guy since I hold geezer with a clipboard
I'm here for bark and blackpool and he looked at me all funny
So I said do you know what that is and he went no the only thing I know is it's 9 times
I'm parking he made
The do you not know why?
So sorry, yeah, your favorite thing
All right, okay, so that was you've everything
I didn't realize we got to that. I thought we were okay cool. So
Anybody else got a final word? Do you want to step in?
No, other than that, you know, if ever you consistently chubbish one of these events come along because they're great fun
Yes
If isn't like why you live start one
Yeah, I can be as big or as small as you want, doesn't it?
Yeah, definitely and I think the the mixture of the crowd I know we've kind of said this already
But the mixture of people in the crowd is really cool as people doing like um
I don't know like textile type stuff like
So in stuff the people making cakes or doing something with one of those things
QR code cakes. There you go QR code cakes and there's people doing I think that's really cool
Self advertising cakes
It is actually, yeah
And while we're up to it, plug for a camp to be in Blackpool
It should be in the heart of England
It should be in the heart of England
I know, I'm in the heart of England
I'm actually quite like to go back to the Maltese if you want to
Would you?
A lot of people said the same
Yeah, I like to go back to the Maltese
I know, I think like I mean obviously it's a whiter whiter whiter
But I think we'll come to it
But I think we'll come to it, yeah
I don't think we'll do a camping next time
No, no
That was an extreme assault
No, Kevver, I do feel bad
Kevver for me was an experience
I had you and Matt had some spider problems
A lot of us had to go and sort spider out
where YouTube was sort of saying good
Yeah, two grown men staying in here while he's more
He's what I felt to come and
And they do some special stuff
Oh wait
That's it, it's a new millennium
You know, the opportunities
That's quite a bonus big
Why are you looking at my wife like that when she was rolling on your tent?
I wanted it, it was something to say
What?
Yeah, there was a group
They were
I can't say because he's here, he's still in the role
It's really bad
Right, the best of us to get a tent
If he claps it, he gets one through one
And he gets all the air out
He can fold it up
So that's about an hour
You get, so I want to roll on the tent
And it gets all the air out
But I think about an hour and a half
Actually, these two try to put it down
So, these six bloats stood in a semi-circle watching
A woman in her pajamas
Wow
Roll on these tents
And all of us making out that
We're not watching you really
Yeah, I'm kind of told
Sorry, next time I'm on a Ditzurf in Rochelle
That's the time, is it?
Well, there is an extra fair too
You need to wait for valentines day
Because he's working well beyond
Ah, excellent
Yeah, probably so
She's sort of transfigured
But I'll walk on it
Yeah, well she won't get away with it
We did a...
I made her a promise that Ockham...
She natural fact
Hasn't used linox yet
Oh, yeah, she hasn't used it
They mean, but she hasn't used it from
Setting it up type of...
Oh, I see
Yeah, yeah
She'll have to use Firefox
So what we said to her Ockham was right
We'll give you six months to
In a sense, try and yourself out
And then what we'll do is whatever you want
And do almost like a from...
What did we call it?
A central and especially
From the capital
From a title, from a title noob to that
I've also got an idea
And also part of the deal was
To do a presentation
Yeah, right
That's really good idea
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, Ockham
So we'd record and
And we could... well
It was going to be about hype, bro
But I thought it was quite cool
So we've all seen each other from one home
And you know, Valentine's Day
So I would say
We'll do it
We'll do it on Valentine's Day
It's going to give you a watch out
Which is sitting next to you
You old romantic
Yeah, some of you
We'll do it on Valentine's and then...
Yeah, I love I've got you some CDs
In store lap, bro
So we're cosulating a lot of subonso
Yeah, you can get you...
Yeah, get you
And if you can do a presentation of Ockham, which is really good
That's it, yeah, that's a title
All right, and so I reckon we should all just quickly say goodbye
In the, you know, go around
So I'm going to say goodbye
From me
Goodbye from Dan
Goodbye from everyone
It's goodbye from him
Goodbye as well
Goodbye from Dan
There you go, that's it for the...
What we're going to call us
The Flying Hambag Toilet Castle
That's got a good moral because we're like, you lose
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
So we'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
We'll see you when we find another toilet to hand in
