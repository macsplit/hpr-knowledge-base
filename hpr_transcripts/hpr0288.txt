。
Welcome to this week's The Excuser Group, all players of the Excuser Group.
Today is January 8th, 2009.
Hi everybody, how are you doing?
Good, good.
Everybody had a good Christmas or Happy New Year.
A tricky hand or whatever.
No, no.
Future theory.
We had to play games.
Yeah.
A lot of positive.
A lot of positive players.
So shall we go with our two days of fame?
Sure.
Really?
I don't know where to start.
We had so much.
I bought Mimi, one of the gala frames.
Does it have a little frame?
And Mimi bought me a bamboo.
For Christmas?
Yeah, the Linux frame.
What's a bamboo?
A bamboo is a little welcome tablet, which is also very nice.
And for New Year's, we got ourselves a new brother, HL 2170.
2170 W.
Black, you know, just playing black and white lazy printer, which is very nice.
It has a wrapper for cup sprinting.
So there's a fair-linked Linux support.
There's no PPD for it.
But it's got a routine to get the brother, gives you dev files that you can use the set,
cups up to print to it for Linux.
So it's been pretty good.
I do have a technical question.
You may have done so many stupid things.
I've got to ask you whether I did this or the other thing.
We're down at the other end of the house with the laptop.
And the wireless doesn't, you know, it's not a good strong signal down there.
But you can put two access points.
I mean, you can put as many access points as you want, right?
And you do have to be careful what channel you put it on.
Because I hooked up a link to this access point today.
Use the same channel?
I can build.
You can do different channels, same SSID.
Here's the situation.
We have two buildings.
I have two buildings.
I have an access point up at one building, which is a barn, which has one channel.
And an access point in the house, just one, that has a different channel.
And as far as I know, those two signals are far enough apart that they can't hear any, but, you know, each other.
Then we also have a, I guess it's called a pass-through because it's just, there's an area in the house that we couldn't run the wire to.
So we have it working the other way.
There's a little box with an antenna that actually sends the signal out to four or five other, you know, ethernet plug places on that thing.
But the bedroom is like behind several pieces of plumbing and a refrigerator and a tile wall.
And so the signal just doesn't get there.
So I have a wire to access ethernet port in the wall there.
So could I possibly find that access point by setting it up wrong value?
Because the network access light doesn't even come on.
It detected it with the setup software.
And as soon as it, you know, reset, it went dead.
The access light doesn't even light up.
So I think it was just a lend.
I mean, I think I just bought a piece of equipment that's, you know, an access point is like two different wireless routers.
And the access point is wireless routers.
Yeah, that's okay.
So if you actually want to do one.
Okay, your organization is what they do.
Like with our company, we have, we use the symbol WS2000s.
Which is there's like one like a central wire device that provides four power over ethernet ports to it.
So with one centralized device, you can set up four different APs.
And then manage them centrally through one interface.
So you log into a letter interface that looks so much to any D-linker, links us or whatever you buy.
And then you configure each AP.
And you can set them up to do to be like B4G or N or N.
Or all of them.
And then you can set the channel assignments to power up.
But the security that you might use radius.
And the idea is just to get more laptops able to be on your network.
Or a larger network.
Or a larger area.
Okay.
That makes sense.
Okay.
So as long as I do fry it, I'll get more.
I want to try again.
That's all.
I don't want to make mistakes.
Yeah, they didn't have an access point.
They had a router that could also be used as an access point.
But I just want straight access always.
That's all I need there.
You are doing just fine.
Yeah, we did really.
Really, it's been fun.
The frame is really kind of interesting.
We set it up with Flickr and Gmail.
Anything you send to Gmail, you know, it downloads and shows.
Actually, what we're going to use it for is Mimi's recipes.
Because we have it on the counter.
Anytime she wants, yeah, really anytime she wants this, you know, we'll just.
You put it all together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you can stop on the forums for the Agala and respond under the wish list of software.
I've got to get it already.
You don't put on some software.
Well, I'm waiting for an active thing so we can just get a little Linux box going.
Wait until the speaker.
Oh, yeah, I will.
No, go on there for them and respond to me.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sounds like it's coming from somebody.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah, basically it was really.
It's a nice look.
It's a very, you know, hardware is very nice.
It's a very nice piece of equipment.
What about us?
I don't remember yet.
Well, we don't keep too many secrets like that.
You know, we're at the same credit card.
We're at the same credit card.
We're at the credit card together.
We're at the credit card.
Yeah, we're at 39.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're so glad.
That's how I don't how much it is.
Yeah, I got one too.
I got one too.
Two, three, four, three, four.
They're nice.
They're full touch screen.
Yeah.
And white and full.
Oh, okay.
So it's more than just one of those desktop picture frames.
Just kidding.
Yeah, it's got a little slideshow in the menus.
Yeah, it's not real big.
You know, it's a little on the small side.
It works for recipes.
Yeah, absolutely.
And we, in fact, it sends us a letter report that updates periodically.
And if we get which one is that, is that the Microsoft library,
where we have some or another secret.
All of those things work, and they've said, I'm very sweet.
You could actually have your panes we have taken from the refrigerator's can.
And that it would actually prefer to be in the shop.
You can find a microwave for that subject.
Okay.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
You too.
Thank you.
I think I'm really a mess up a while.

So most important things for me.
I will try to fix my brochures.
I will try to fix my brochures.
I will try to fix my brochures.
I will try to fix my brochures.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Yes.
Alright.
I'll try to fix my brochures.
Alright.
Alright.
I'll try to fix my brochures.
Ok, thank you Not a big problem.
I'll try to fix your brochures.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
I just saw it.
You see it, everybody.
Just checking.
Oh, I was supposed to cry.
I was supposed to cry at the moment to do that.
It doesn't pay to complain to me.
That's how you do that.
I think I'll worry about it.
You neither are you drawing.
It's everything else.
He's on the last set.
It's not everything.
I'll keep that in.
And he's a whole new person.
By the way, that printer really is a nice printer.
I mean, I've had several laser printers,
and it prints the print qualities very good.
It's very easy to set up.
Is that the same one you bought?
The XL was 2170.
I have a 4070.
Can you do 11 by 17 on that?
Does that get up to that?
No.
I think the 4040 does 11 by 17.
And Mike.
I might borrow that.
Yeah, I was in the first floor of the web,
so I'd say they have a lot of good support on the web.
My brother worked for left-right out of the box,
and I had flashed for one of those.
You know, I was speaking to my brother.
I'm not getting along so well.
I'm not getting along.
I'm a brother.
I'm a brother.
I'm a brother.
Yeah, a HP fact machine,
and we were on our third rendition of it,
and getting in between,
getting the new one to fix it.
We lost it out of our old brother,
a fact machine,
that we had in the shelf,
like two years ago,
or plugged it in,
or we were it up in February.
I'll go ahead and pick up the belt.
Good.
It's good to go ahead.
Yeah, obviously.
I'll live days for people to be with you.
Well, yeah.
So we were listening to this broadcast,
by all means,
and a little note to go.
Okay.
Let's say the relations will be accepted.
It's planned.
Yeah.
Our sponsor for this week is brother and brother.
Well, you know, I'm raising up 11 by 17,
because I'd like a large format.
I will never use another inkjet,
or a laserjet printer,
because it's just,
I just keep going.
It's sick and tired.
Yeah, go to the poor house,
and if you don't print 16 prints a day,
next time you go to use it,
it doesn't work.
Yeah.
But I can't afford the Lexmark 11 by 17 printer.
It's like $3,200 bucks.
So, what's yours?
Here's the one that's very good,
unless not that expensive.
It's 300.
Yeah.
And they say it's a very good printer,
because brother,
that do the 11 by 17.
So, probably end up giving it a try.
Well, you guys talked about printers.
We also bought a printer.
I bought a HP.
I'm not the brother.
And I didn't use it.
It was pretty good, actually.
It does have a,
that's a multi-purpose stuff.
So, it has a scanner,
and bags, and coffee,
and printing,
and it's lighthearted.
And,
so there was a Linux driver,
there's a Linux driver.
And, you guys do the scanning,
and that's everything,
whatever it needs to do.
So, it was also painless,
and it worked pretty good.
So, I'm just saying.
So, that's why you buy HP,
and you actually get this driver.
This driver supported with this Linux application.
It didn't come on the CD,
but when you went on a website,
they were saying,
well, here's this depth file.
I don't know if it was that file,
or, or.
Oh, good.
Nice communication here.
Yeah.
We have to connect it to my printer here.
So, if you're right here,
you set up your IPP.
So, you use me here, I think.
It is up right now.
It plugs to a router.
So, that's what it is.
So, the newer routers
can make this key question round.
Can you get a separate one?
Yeah, it's coming.
So, it is really nice that,
as long as you're on the network,
you actually don't have to worry about that.
And, this driver was supported
by, I don't know,
1500 printers.
1500 printers.
So.
I really,
do we work in pretty good?
I really like the Linux HP driver.
I just, if I had an HP friend,
there was a mobile jet,
you know, a business HP generator.
That's $2200.
It's not working.
I know it's bigger than my cartridge.
It's virtual,
because they reported the aid
once they were expressed by me.
Well, when I stay and tell what the aid was.
So, we're just going to,
it's going to be perfect.
When I was at all.
So, some of the new printers
are walking right into your ethernet.
That's all you have.
That's all you have.
That's all you have.
This one's actually wireless.
Yeah.
My hardware's got Wi-Fi, too.
Yeah.
As long as you're pretty close to the...
Yeah, they're, they're,
there was the worst quick-
possibility for Wi-Fi.
We have enough wires now.
Yes, it's really good.
You can't match that out of your house.
You don't want to know.
All right, are you down here?
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
It's two minutes.
It's the most messed up.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
All right.
No questions?
Who's next to me?
I'm sure it is.
All right.
Pretty eventful New Year's time.
By the way, we picked out a new computer.
At least all the components for it.
So, we're going to build it.
So then I got stuck to read about video cards.
Hold on.
I just saw these were a simple thing.
But if you're free now.
Don't worry.
I don't like that.
And then I got stuck in this Tom's hardware site.
Oh.
That's what I thought you were going to do.
Yeah, I was looking there and reading up on them.
And you know, then you go on Duwag and Manor's Deadly.
A thousand video cards.
Yeah.
So anyway, it was interesting.
Oh, I sure learned a lot.
So the rest of it's pretty kind of dry.
You know, the processor and the motherboard and the memory
aren't that tough and hard drive, it's easy.
But then you get to these video cards.
And you know, then you go on Nvidia site.
And it says, you know, look below our handy chart to figure out
which video card you need.
And all of them are rated like super duper good.
Except for the very cheap one.
And that one's pretty good.
So it's like, well, I don't know.
Damn it.
So you might have the super cheap one.
Now I bought a hundred and ten dollar one.
So I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, you know, they go up pretty quick from there.
But it's strange business those video cards.
Because they maybe determined new products so often.
It's just a...
It's a good thing.
It's a good thing.
Yeah.
It's a good thing going at it.
Yeah.
Actually, I think you said they can't buy components more
than quantity than what they get.
The manufacturers of the components run their run.
And then they move on.
And then they...
And then they...
So you can only make them back to the server.
And then they have to keep redesigning the card.
Because they can't get...
They can't get components.
I started to notice that some of the latest chips.
Like from the video.
They're starting to go in the multi-core direction.
Just like a lot of the processors live.
And one of the highest-ended video ones.
And I forget the model.
But it had nine graphics cores on the graphics chip.
I thought that was kind of interesting.
And indeed, for either this year that we're getting in the next year,
it's got scheduled fusion, which is going to have two processor cores
and one graphics core on one chip.
Yeah.
I'm going to just...
There is just a great implant for them as well.
And we'll just get anything with the phenonic, too.
So that's not going to go wrong.
We're now going back to the 1990s on 3DFX,
really simple.
I think we're going to...
Well, it's a problem with Linux and video cores.
You've got to be two or three generations back to get into support.
Well, here's...
Now, if you may...
ATI.
ATI is...
AMD is trying to fix that.
ATI really is.
AMD, the parent company for the whole world said,
that you're doing this.
I'm sure that's what happened.
Yeah.
Well, I usually get a good buy on the...
The current video card on my best Linux machine.
It's an AMD ATI radio.
3500, I think, or 3600.
And I usually buy them.
But when I get a little good,
when the price really starts to roll off,
I buy it, put it away for three years,
and then I ain't slow it.
And then I get a perfect six-four,
and I have them back.
And then the support is there,
you're saying, yeah, but then they pull it up,
and the Jews, you know,
get some decent driver's school in Kentucky.
That's the season.
Obviously.
Check the link.
Who that is is the water.
Water, sir.
Water and...
And chain up the ingredients.
That's good.
So that was interesting, really interesting.
A lot of thanks, Byron.
And then, now, the second thing is I put together
a computer for my parents,
and I put a bunch on it,
and they are absolutely almost computer illiterates.
So we'll see how it goes.
Because right now they've got a Linux machine,
or a Windows machine,
and it's a disaster with viruses.
I mean, it takes, you know,
it takes a 45 minutes for the thing to load up,
because it's just got so many viruses.
And if it needs to send all those mail...
Well, the problem with it is,
is they can't distinguish,
you know, you'll get this thing
and pops up and says,
oh, download this to clean your registry.
Well, they can't determine if it's a legitimate thing.
So they download it,
and it's just a disaster.
So...
You're not going to be able to call that again.
Yeah, I mean, if they can get their email,
and they can get on the internet,
and maybe watch some flash stuff,
that's, as of the extent,
what they're going to do.
And I think it's going to be wonderful.
I think that's the perfect situation for me.
Yeah, I've got it all set up for them,
you know, everything done.
So...
And then I got one last question.
You know, back in the poll,
it's probably the middle eighties,
pray research came off with these super computers,
you know, when the golden chip falls,
what are they?
Or what are they here?
Laws in process are...
They're vector processing,
they're big,
bread and butter,
as of that era.
This other way,
so, I've been in a lot of corner government in the sand.
I don't know if you know what vector processing is.
No, I don't know any further.
I've been massively parallel,
these days.
What is the speed was evolved?
What is the computer right now?
Well, you're in the end speed,
it's not going to be that good,
it's not going to be that good.
It's not going to be that good.
So basically,
the basic, like,
a whole bunch of computers linked together,
working towards one goal.
Processors.
Yeah.
Processors.
Yeah.
I'm our positive.
You can go,
there's a CV,
and chip off value,
MIT.
You can go to CBIT,
every way.
And it's actually music.
Yeah, MIT.
Yeah, it's a museum.
And it gets,
yeah, it should just break computers there.
Yeah.
You mean the actual computer?
So actual,
how to look like,
yes, never really often once.
Oh, you mean it's a picture of it?
You don't,
yes.
No, that was there.
Oh, it's actually a museum.
It's a museum.
It's a black day.
What's that looks like?
Yeah, that might be better.
I'm sure you was.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So we've all seen about industry
and technology.
Yeah.
Hold it.
It's cool.
Yeah.
You can see it.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
You can see it.
We've got the kids,
yes.
We thought nobody got it,
or rebeige,
you know, so then you got to take that
into account.
So, I,
I was,
They're all over the place, sometimes they're more, sometimes they're less, but it always
pays to check and off.
I've walked into them.
Yeah, the memory, motherboard, processor, hard drive and video card.
See, Greg, when we were in school, we didn't know computers had cases.
We thought they all came on a big rally.
And you could call them in the midst of a prisoner.
No, you have to get the air-conditioning on in the room.
And he didn't allow more than four people in the room at the time.
Yeah, it's amazing.
Unless they'd call you.
Yeah.
They had the core, you know, the little tubes with the graphics on them.
That was the core memory.
And I can remember, this guy built a tunnel where he used to do these.
The thought point was that he'd start with a shape here, and it would like morph into some other shape.
And he was printing out these long pieces of paper, you know, graphics in art department.
But he would be like in the whole, the current economy nominated.
All the buildings that he built, he built that if the college was a failure, they could turn it into an assembly line.
So all the hallways run down the slope so that you know, the gravity feed for any assembly line that they put in there.
And it totally would be out in the hallway with literally like a hundred feet of these punch cards, you know, and stacked out on any old computer.
Yeah, the old computer, I think, would have a hundred feet of them, you know, running down the hallway that he was sorting and putting in certain orders for these programs he was running.
Yeah.
He put them in a big box as you put a whole thing in there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
of losing it for us at least.
No, we're working out.
We are working out.
No, we're missing a proportion right now instead of all the foreign on this cards, they're working fine.
Yeah.
But even, it's even interact when you can't touch it.
No.
Alright.
Wow.
Yes.
I thought you wanted to slide your hands in.
Oh!
No, this is not a moment.
Just webcam.
These are on them.
This webcast is going to get our rating count.
Yeah.
It's going to be realistic.
It's going to be realistic.
It's going to be realistic.
The idea is do the eye-life online announcement came and announced that eye-life online
is how we use facial recognition algorithms to sort our pictures.
Yeah.
Faces and places.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I was watching the videos before again here.
Do you watch your time sorting online?
Yeah.
Okay.
It's pretty.
That's how I think about it.
That's how I think about it.
I've got an eye flip mini anti-recorder.
It records 720p.
Yeah.
Okay.
A little 720p.
It's like the nice stuff that I have.
Yeah.
And only.
The high back one.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I had to have my desk.
There's a movie.
Okay.
I had to have my desk.
There's a movie.
Okay.
I had to have my desk.
There's a movie.
Okay.
I had to have my desk.
There's a movie.
A little thing you recorded, well that big scroll.
You know the whole script that you were on and on and on.
Yeah I know.
Ooh.
That's a couple weeks ago.
Okay now.
So have you had a, so let me go demo.
Well you're like, I was like, not on your drone.
Maybe don't be acting at the movies.
I don't want to show it.
Cause there's lots of play video.
Right?
see what else. Oh yeah man this triple lead yeah the hard drive you know the
solid state hard drive the way it's supposed to be yeah wait for the future and
it's not supposed to crash yeah it does work so much. As long as they've done
get rid of it what's the problem? I don't know. It won't come and it gives bad
mirrors so I'm gonna try and get the rescue on it. I can still put it because it
actually does have two hard drives and it's the user the user space one that
isn't working so I'm gonna use the rescue trying to cap it off onto the next
kind of networks. How do you try the hard drive?
I don't know. It's still right on yet. But I want to try the rescue
you get the data on it. I didn't get it actually well and it's been so much
time for a lot of years and we've got to get in here both anybody's the hard drive
I think it's not a state for a lot of people. But I've been fluent what the
device says is triple lead. That little hole right there. Yeah but I'll bet it
first fail but they're going to be a massive problem so if there was a lot of
ramping up capacity. This is one of the first iterations to how much space do
you have? This one was 16 gig and then the one with the operating system on
this 4k. So the 16 gig was one. So there's two drives. Yes. I don't think built
right off of the motherboard. I have no idea. I haven't understood anything. Yeah.
There's a panel on the back. If I can't use DD rescue I might look at that and see
if there's a regular serial 18 or things just so I can put it in something else.
Don't read the image of it because I still think I could probably run that
this guy. If I can get the contents of the hard drive on when I can see but it
won't bet this will fail immediately because it'll read that sector and
it won't work. So DD rescue what it does is if it reads a bad bad information it
writes it zero and then tries the next plan. It still reads it writes it zero
tries to explain. So you get over the bad sectors and then when you run
that this it's not a bad sector. It's just wrong information that's not just
a bad sector. I mean they try to write to it and the stuff coming back is wrong.
The information coming off the hard drive, the internal circuitry, the signal
has to be within a certain range or to be one or a certain range or to be
through. There's actually a person who's listening as I said that he won't
try to write the HBR but he still gives us tips on how to make sure that
applies to that. What's the HBR after public radio? That's what our recording is
acting up. And I was amazed that for the analysis in the adage it's been
regularly extended for the analysis and it wasn't anything special for the
flash so I don't know if they've got some underlying circuitry to
hear that or if they aren't writing the entire sector. But I mean it's
just the standard usage so it should have been sure. Anything. Yeah and it's
got the default operating system on it. I mean besides I'm not can you
advance more. Everything is pretty much stuck on. So I don't see any reason why
it should fail. Especially this way. I think you need to buy a brother. Yeah
brother should be easy. Yes. The screen will look nice. But you have to print
out the people to read it. Yes. That's not so funny. They used it. The
all the communication with the PDV8 they had. The PDV8 was a tellax machine.
You know she used to type things in and the thing would type back you know it's
all like an echo thing. Yeah. If it wasn't brother you wouldn't have a keyboard
either. You'd have to print your everything in a little app. A little screen.
I thought that was a cell phone.
All right. Moving right along. Yeah. That's so beautiful. Yeah we've actually I
think that we should know as soon as we get posted here. Okay then we'll be
here first. These are the words. Thank you. We've got such a
very welcome. Since you don't have a brother who figured you'd check it out.
I have a sister. I don't care.
You know I need to go. Did you get the admin for the group?
I have one. I need one of the admin.
Oh wait. How was your trip? Yeah.
It was a little cold going there because our Chinese throws.
But these things are key to electrical and somehow we lost heat.
And that wasn't fun. Now it's four hours late.
But that should be on that. That's being compared to trying to get home.
It was supposed to be there at 11 o'clock a.m. in the morning.
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
And I got to show up at 0 a.m. the next day.
Oh. Yeah. Almost three four hours late.
I should have warned you. It's the world we limited that used to leave it for an engine.
I'd never left before for our amp.
They had a freight train break down in front of us.
So we still have like 17 of my roommates that played chess.
They moved like past one stop so they picked people up.
And then another freight train broke down for our one.
And friends were locked so they had to come in like this place.
Like the airplane's on it.
So I had to push it back for another five hours.
We were going to make sure the rolls were going to be all going to get to the top.
Or we had to get out of the train because it was 10 inches.
Before we got on our way.
I went to troll up there.
She says, we don't want to do it.
I'm going to close the road.
I'm going to get dressed.
I'm going to cross the road.
But, uh, so yeah.
Well, they do that.
They do it in a certain order.
They do it in Wisconsin.
Oh, yeah, they do it all day.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The trip was nice though.
We got a helicopter.
Small.
The big guys.
Got a cabin up there.
They still shoot around on the scene.
To close all over the cabin because it's so close.
I told her a 또.
It's been deployed.
That's your last link.
Hold herra.
Hold herra.
Hold herra.
Watch your slide.
Hold this one.
Hold yourra.
Hold herra.
Hold herra, the camera.
Hold it.
Hold yourra.
If you have a table saw, you've got to give the big board splits on it or it's really such a limitation.
If you can stick it on the base or the base, you can put wheels on it.
As soon as it's disappointed me, there's supposed to be a release that you're going on for months ago when they still haven't done this.
That was supposed to have touch screwing in and the wire was just built into a mod.
They still haven't released it. They don't even talk about it anymore.
We'll have a suit for 20 hours. Now I'm going to probably get a gallon.
I'll take it.
What's that racket?
I'll see you guys as soon as I can get my press base to support it.
That's what I want to turn it in modern.
I'm going to have a prescription right there.
All right, idea. Let's end again.
Last permigate. Let's not get it.
Aren't you going to get some stepper motors and have a little computer operated way to save them?
All that stuff and do some research.
Is there a fabrication?
Or a dust collection?
I mean, I have a right new living room.
You can use those stepper motors to get the kitchen and put the idea up to it and have it comportable.
My usual joke was that five years later I worked out and saw nothing happened to them.
The only other thing.
Look at all those good fingers that I have to sing.
I didn't even move this button. I just got a puppy.
Oh, that's a nice person.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, yeah.
So like a real like a little thing?
Well, it's not a whole thing.
Yeah, we would be cool stuff.
We might as big as they do as you can go.
What time is it?
Great.
Oh, great.
Good luck.
Those are big poops.
Good luck, man.
Sure.
It's a play.
So you can go and roll the wool.
This paper is a no-grash in your backyard.
That's what it's about.
They're pretty laid back dogs.
That's how it fits up.
Just be just fine.
We have a friend who I think Pittsburgh went two great days.
They were just mother-fathers.
He is moving couches.
I see it.
One time I met somebody who had two great things.
They brought two balls in the farm.
They have very great money data.
They're beautiful animals.
The boy they were sharing.
You know, they don't have a long, long fur.
But they went, you know, it was all over the place.
So we were expecting one.
In a year she should be about at least 30 inches high
and she should be about $100.
At least at least 30 inches high.
So you don't have a baby.
Yeah, I'm gonna get up every night at 1 a.m.
I'm gonna get up every night at 1 a.m.
I'm gonna get up every night at 1 a.m.
You know, this kind of stuff.
So first people get a baby and they have a dog.
And when they have a kid, the dog will have a leg hurt
and after the dog is in the pond, they get a kid.
You know, what though the kids are less work than the damn dog I thought?
You know, I don't know that.
Then I have a dog.
I always have a dog.
He's a dog.
He's tough.
He's six years old.
He spends every day.
Somebody from work sent me this 14-second clip on YouTube.
You have to listen to it.
It's from CSI News.
It's from...
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
CSI News.
It's from...
CSI New York.
I don't know.
You'll be able to hear it or not.
What's the only thing?
You'll be able to hear it.
It's a TV show.
Yeah.
It's going to be too quiet.
Well can't... can't eat McDonald's on his machine.
And he has fewer beers.
You have a better speaker, so...
I have a speaker.
No matter, I hold those don't have speakers, or normal.
Those things?
Yeah.
Does it not already work?
It does.
That's as long as the ghost and it's a laptop.
It's a laptop, a laptop.
If you're with my laptop, you're with my laptop.
Oh, my laptop.
I guess it's a case of building it.
I'm not even shaped.
On the barrier, it was a case of building it.
But anyway, it's on the CSI and New York.
They don't know technology at all,
so they were trying to come up with something.
It sounded right, but they had no idea.
So, the extent to me is a link that I would put in the letter.
It's actually a good idea.
If I were to put my laptop to you right now,
do you have better features?
Send it to your bugger out of frame.
What does that mean for you?
What does that mean for you?
What does that mean for you?
Does it make videos?
Yeah.
Well, it's like a VBI.
I think so, yeah.
I'm not sure what it is.
It weighs up to three years.
So, as you can see,
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

He is three four four four four four four four four four three four four four four four four ...
I don't know what the?
I don't know what the?
I don't know what the?
He is looking at me and.
I think he is looking at me these two.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what him is.
I don't know what unbalt I think of him.
I don't know what he is.
I don't know what he is?
I don't know what he is?
You know.
It was 12.
You are writing.
That's who you guys were.
It was you know.
Yeah.
That's who you guys were.
You are probably starting out faster than me.
a piece of panoet Converture.
it's a certain more of a fascination
this is a real time, i'll be interviewing a piece of this
i'll sing in the audience
i mean we're ..otsyk
Yeah, that's good, that's good.
Okay, what?
And the best beginning of the campaign,
we can't be killing merch with a certain more
of an assassination.
This is a real time.
I'll create a video for you to see some visual links
so you can see my channel on P.M.
That's so cool.
That's cool.
What is this?
We interface that.
You're right.
Oh, not in VB.
No way.
I just, that was quite funny.
What's that?
I look for a Google interface with VB to try.
See if I can get my Tager.
It's like straight on the original hands.
It's good, 28.
What?
Wow.
That's one of the lines.
That's one of the lines from the movies.
It's hilarious.
At the time.
All I was using was some chocolate.
We were able to do it.
Yeah.
But yeah, I haven't been here for a long time.
For weeks, I'm Andrew.
I work with these two guys.
I used to stuff by everyone.
But last three weeks,
I've been working a lot.
My new baby is,
I've been working a lot of open-source.
And, um,
working specifically with Postgres.
And, um, my school,
and I'm having a baby's free stuff.
Um, baby, are you working with them?
Uh, yeah, I have for a little bit.
But, not,
not a whole lot of you, not that quick.
Um, I'm going to see three of them.
And that's right, that's right.
I have to.
She had to make some dollars to deal with that.
What?
Well, I'm sorry.
New,
the way from Postgres systems.
Every month, for a few weeks,
so I've been saying it's like,
it's kind of going through a little bit of a problem.
Cool.
Well, great.
Great timing.
I'm going to keep the action two minutes.
Okay.
Well, you can still go 15 seconds.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, I forgot everything.
Oh, you have not?
Yeah, I'm the same track as, uh,
it's getting.
No, I didn't.
I did, uh,
I took more part
than bought at the pool.
And it's similar to if you didn't drive a lot.
Or if you can drive a lot.
Finally, over the break end,
the time that I should tear the case in the park,
what it was, that's my machine.
It was a pretty good machine, I don't know.
A break control,
or something like that.
It might be a big software break.
So,
let's stop there.
Let me just break it up and stop.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
I'm shaking a lot.
No, okay.
Try installing it,
if it works,
if you don't have to stop,
you can use it again.
Okay.
So, we have to have sure of the door.
You know, I made the band again,
or point them again.
For some reason, I'm going to change the appearance
and the font's all I'm looking for.
It's happening every new year,
being able to install it on them,
I'm going to let it come in on my desk,
not the door.
The door, I'm institutioned with developers.
You need to fix it.
Set the badge.
Set the badge,
unless you're leaving it.
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Oh, I did it.
I can find the router.
You get one in here.
It's garbage.
Well,
there's a badge here which
has open source.
I want it to plug it in.
So,
I want it to get a
flash so that you can actually
do that.
You can plug it in.
I'm going to try to do it.
Okay.
Then, why don't you get one?
You can get one.
You can get one.
You can get one.
You can get one.
You can get one.
Excuse.
I didn't hear the word from the police.
I was suddenly in the middle of the door.
That's I did.
Then he shouted.
I was stunned.
Then, you see it.
Sorry everybody.
I think, yeah, the problem with
the routers that they have been
overheated,
because they are so compassionate and
the big loser.
Or the reason.
The reason?
The reason.
When you don't know how to put,
thank you,
you may have $33 hits down there.
open-crowing protocol, maybe, but it's basically just a collection of all the
first stuff I wish I mean.
You run it on your own, your computer, or what, from an animal's
stuff, it's the most, you know, like, you're not going to run it on your own.
It's a bunch of distribution.
Yeah, the thing about it is, the only issue is that you're using your own computer at the time.
So the router takes five watts, computer takes energy efficiency.
Yeah, it's not a sponsor.
Yeah.
Sometimes.
Absolutely.
It was nice before I had my router flash.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You said, look at that.
That's what I mean.
Laying excuse would be getting ready for baby again.
We're organizing our house.
See, so first excuse goes and put it out.
It's right there.
That's why you don't have any kind of excuse.
No, you don't have another.
Which one is it?
Yeah.
Wow.
How do you know?
You know what I mean?
I'll do it.
Nice to meet you.
We're accepting you now.
It's a pretty good resolution, doesn't it?
Yeah.
The real issue.
Thanks for coming.
It's a little smiling, but you can blow it up if you can, you know, you need to save your
everything.
You need a lot of real time care.
I said, I wanted a system.
We have Liam and Maya and I told him to be a name to start with, and that's four letters long to really see him.
That would be an adult.
And I got a man of trouble for juxtaposing that.
You know what? You are starting to build that older rhythm.
You are starting with the latter that you might need, but...
Nevermind.
Don't think about it.
You gotta make it something important.
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what I'm talking about?
It was a one for me.
Brick.
And then you have over the files.
I know they took like a month to upload the last couple of files.
You are doing a great job.
Good connection with that one.
So I had some fun on skin now.
I asked you to do some circuit play.
You need some more good sound cards.
You need a little more of those.
Cool.
And crash like that.
Very important to my editor.
You need your street keys cutting up.
So you can see a lot more.
I think it is because somebody is installing something here.
What is that?
I tried it actually.
I tried it with the door, but it didn't automatically pick up my wireless driver.
So I just installed it in a virtual machine just to play with it.
I'm not going to do a one-stop.
So I just...
We were in the navigation room.
Not yet.
I have the M-Routes Fusion.
And then I also have a refit with a separate 20G partition to dual-bluetable partition.
And then I also have a refit with a separate 20G partition to dual-bluetable partition.
So I have to play in a room.
It has nothing to send to online.
I have just play in a room with different distributions and stuff.
The hand brake.
Which is fine.
Well, I just...
but the new is saying very harshly, I haven't tried that one, I just haven't done it yet, so
here it does, it seems to all go, but we'll be going, uh, super-precious, let's assume on the, uh,
if we have the problem, instead of all, you know, all the spots for changing mind,
you know, whether or not, but I can point one person,
the line is engulfed, you're thinking, could you open up the, uh, the, uh,
uh, appearance, or the content, yeah, they all like I've slowed a huge,
and I'll have to send up like six and trigger back to about 10.
You know, when we booted our fights, then we opened up and they, you know,
it's just, I think it was just what it is, and the old one's happening that, you know,
the only four weeks of time, and we're probably trying to do it with that map
direction, we're not doing it with you, the universe is, yes, firing against you.
You're gonna invest into the universe, you're gonna invest into the universe,
you're gonna get a universal cause, and most problems, fair,
SC clinics, they switch the, um, certificate, they're not certificates,
but the default policies are nine to actually, they, we pretty much turned it up.
You know what that does make? Cause at one time, I installed the Alani,
uh, only the server-ized, you can fuck with right out of that, but it's, uh,
they, when you installed the Alani, you, uh, each game,
all digital systems, certainly turned off, as you let it install,
and I'm just, I'm nervous.
Turn it off?
Got it.
I know, I think about that machine didn't have, uh, the font problem.
Right?
Everyone I installed by myself did whatever it looks like.
So I think I've had it as an issue every once in a while,
not a list will be able to connect to, uh, bone bone back in,
which is a configuration server, and SC clinics,
that's denying the connection for some of the solutions.
So I don't know.
That's, that's why I went to this with our open as far as here.
And that's it.
Everything is working, it has beautiful parents,
it actually dims and, uh, lights,
and do all the things, what it has to do.
I did that to the background for 90% of the national font,
and based on the time of day,
it changes to the background.
Well, that's, uh, I think, original stuff.
Actually, it's, uh, we, we wrote it up to,
we were thinking with it a little bit, and, uh,
you can set it down to change every one second.
Yeah, huh.
Give yourself a minor.
Sweet.
Yeah, I'd like to, I have to.
Oh, all you guys are staying in here,
how long you're supposed to stay here?
About nine.
Nine?
Nine?
Okay.
Why, what's the matter?
Take them out of double-footed cover.
Any cover?
Yeah, we have a bookstore, but, uh,
we'll see if we can have beer with them.
Oh, well, the airline gives us a money back,
with it.
Sorry.
You should stop.
Uh, uh, well, long papers.
So, what if, what it does,
there is the solar.
Actually, in whatever,
but, uh, U.S.R. share,
there's this, the solar.
And over there, there is this hexamount.
So, the, uh,
no leads the hexamount.
Now, in the hexamount, she is defined.
And it can connect the frequency of resolution,
so I can get the same error.
Yes.
Yes.
And, uh,
and, uh,
and, uh,
and something.
So, over there,
it actually says,
whatever is going to be,
and then there's a time when it's going to change.
Um,
but if you wait for,
for every ten seconds,
you'll see it anyways,
like after you've had a lot of time.
Because when it's changing,
uh,
it's of course fine.
And, uh,
yeah.
That's really odd.
If I would have changed,
uh,
and when it goes into 20 virus checker,
and then it's just changing your background.
That's, uh,
that's sweet enough.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
So, this is changing your wallpaper?
Yes.
Now, actually,
multiple,
if we go here,
and, uh,
so you have,
and then, uh,
that four images,
and changes depending on time,
when you say,
and it cycles multiple over and over.
Well, there's much difference in a blizzard.
Well, that's the art of telepharmus.
The lighter,
the closer screen you can probably see there.
One of the most important things
that you can make every day.
And then,
yeah.
Test some more.
Oh, wow.
Well, I would never even pick that up.
If you have it for,
I teach ten seconds,
you look,
oh, ten seconds,
maybe,
I thought that changes are a few hours.
And then,
those are a little bit of a spectrum.
And then,
just change every five hours.
Yes.
It's not supposed to be,
like, a main constraint,
it's supposed to be,
kind of,
sort of, as well.
And, I'm surprised that,
you know, how much,
how much CPU it takes
when it goes from one image to another.
It doesn't melt.
It doesn't melt.
It doesn't melt.
It's a boom too.
Definitely,
Google that.
Yeah.
Basically,
from one image to three,
maybe, you know,
like,
how much does that need to take forever?
Well, the three,
seeing the problem
around your background.
Well,
the screen slivers,
like,
your actual desktop
or the three motion.
There's a package
and condescending.
Did you,
one mic?
Yeah.
In video,
just released,
the three guys,
you saw all these things.
Yeah.
But, yeah.
They do,
uh,
it's too independent
and quarantined
there for the signals.
And,
er,
wait,
what's their volume?
Well,
the thing is,
it's just like,
classic, uh,
it's like,
classic 3D.
You have 3D,

Light is beautiful, but I'd like to let you know what's your version of it.
I'm glad we agree.
That's what we're going to do.
It was there in the half.
They wanted to do it.
Wait a minute.
Let me just cross the mile.
Does somebody agree?
I don't really agree.
There are a lot of worries.
There's a little bit of speed.
So I'm sure they're making it easy too.
When you do cross the mile,
you see people lost,
carry with them.
Let's see if they can safely include that.
It's not in the realm of development,
tools, activities, and streets.
I asked me to include that.
Well, it's probably worth personally to add everything in the kitchen.
So it's anything with your work?
It's distribution for developers.
What was it?
It was a 20 second group time.
It was like a major.
It was a 10-per-second group time.
It was a 10-per-second group time.
It was a 10-per-second group time.
I think we're working on group time.
So they still are getting accepted with that.
I mean, if you had different tools.
They are getting better.
You know, the buildings used to move.
You know, the machines are getting tec, aren't they?
But also, you know, you used to,
the screen which actually went from top to bottom.
If they could replace it with off-starred,
just more prevent driven.
It's probably worth a cent of a year.
So I would think you could compile your current
specific machine at a lot less time.
What are you guys going to tweak?
At, like, probably.
I don't know.
So you're not on the time to buy a slow-to-proper.
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, okay.
I was just going to say,
you know, if you go there,
that's not a part of the problem.
Do you have any problems?
Every minute's curling to get more of a distribution
as a generic.
Oh, yeah.
When I was doing slackwear,
when I built my own carnival,
it was like a third decision.
Curival, you can't do that very well.
Yeah.
And they just keep getting changed, too,
and all the way.
Yeah.
You guys, you got more and more hardware support there.
Sitting here in the country was the other player.
Staying the same as hardware,
you got multiple attorneys.
As long as they have a future to approach
it's how they actually put their load into the car,
how they do it.
You know, some distributions,
they're trying to take what the hardware you have
and then they blow those modules and some distributions,
they take loads of holes in the uniform module
without trying to take whatever you have.
So they have different approaches,
how does it rest?
Who are you love if you manage to?
Well, we got new HP.
The printer.
The computer.
I don't know what you're doing.
I was on an education from the New
Edge for three weeks.
Actually, I was pretty good at that.
I didn't have a good idea.
I tried 64-bit distributions
because all this was came.
So, open to 64-bit words on my computer
for the rest of the 64-bit words on my computer.
But it would be 64-bit doesn't work.
People would work everything.
And I thought, you know, it doesn't work how.
It just doesn't work.
It would be 64-bit.
You have a battery installed on the label
or an E64.
Yes.
Which should matter what?
It doesn't work.
So, I thought I'd try open to 64-bit words on my computer.
It shouldn't make a difference.
It shouldn't make a difference.
Does it work?
No, it doesn't.
Just to insert the live CD.
So, yeah.
It doesn't work.
Well, you can shut it off and then you can turn it back on
with the install.
I could do the install.
The thing is that out of distributions I'm working, you know.
And this distribution, how much violent it still has to switch
to a better distribution.
They go up with distributions.
But developers don't put up with that.
I know they wrote this ad.
They make stuff that works.
So, here's a question.
I got to do a computer.
I think it's 64-bit.
What do I do?
Just stick in the Ubuntu CD.
You can try it.
You can try it.
64-bit whatever is your preferred distribution.
Well, I got the Ubuntu, the E10 disk.
Yeah.
So, stick it in there and it'll work.
64-bit version is the two-bit version.
Get the 64-bit version.
It'll tell you if it won't work.
The only great thing about it is the 64-bit version.
It didn't occur to me that any family creates simply.
There's a 64-bit version that works beautifully now.
It actually gives you the Alfa.
It's Alfa, but I've had significant less problems with this Alfa
than I have with their actual voice.
Like, seriously, Flash is actually stable now.
Like, it was all in the interface wrapper.
Right, I think it was 32-bit.
You should remember, when we were in Ohio,
they were talking about the Alfa.
And it was that just the developers from Adobe,
by talking closer to whoever out of developers,
and they actually streamed like it.
So, there's Rebecca.
Well, game time.
Eight years later.
Back to your original question.
The distributions are completely separate.
32-bit 64-bit.
So, I'd have to read down load.
64-bit version.
That's why I said, if you don't have it,
if you want to wait, I'd next switch.
Okay.
If it manages to speed.
Yeah, it appears to be a stab here.
It does.
Okay.
It's really simple.
But I'm more unstable.
I would say so.
I would say, if you're a beast,
that benefit is that it's supposed to match here.
So, 32-bit.
Where it's fine, too.
So, it's done.
So, it's all right.
It doesn't matter.
Okay.
If you have, if you have,
if you have born and form, you go grand.
I have four.
You know, all that.
No.
You can start with two big, sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or it's the absolute limit that you go out of your fridge.
Four of them.
You're used with three of them.
Three of them.
Eight of them.
And four of them.
Yeah.
That's all we get.
Well, video card is, it is not more of the service.
So, that would be, that would be, that would be actually your,
your consideration that you spend money for four gigs,
and that you can use on three of them out of gigs.
You know, it's every gig.
Depending on the settings, you can only use three.
Three of them, too.
Right?
Yeah.
If you don't have that, there it is.
I know.
Which is the number one setting where you choose four.
Which you'll be able to have that on.
Yes.
That's a far of the third risk.
32 to have a 32 to have a 34-minute bossy,
and you would get a process.
Just 32 to have only addresses, 3.2 mags there, right?
The fourth, or the fourth?
Yeah, the eighth.
Well, the eighth.
Okay.
So that they would be, you spend a little bit of money on it,
or rent, or whatever, but you will not be able to actually
appreciate it.
So, that's your downside.
So you have 800 mags in there that's totally not being able to be used.
So you're going to be able to get out there and use it
to get a 30-40.
I've never been able to consume more than, like,
if you can put it over at a bus or whatever.
Three or four machines.
What?
I've got two, and I have to close stuff there.
You do?
Yes.
You need to switch distribution.
I feel like I used to be in this club so far.
What?
In a learning system's distribution,
whether you're going to use more,
I'm going to be getting a half of here.
What do you do with it?
I was able to use the shelter for use.
Use it for the use.
You know, like through some, doing a lot of stuff,
how big of photos?
I mean, I can work with one.
These are 100 mags.
100 mags.
Is it any one?
Yeah.
This is over 400 mags, when I load them in the case.
So then you need to buy all.
That's a 400-100.
I have to do it at 600 DPI,
otherwise I can't get high enough resolution to print it off.
Holy Gosh.
If you do an imaging process and get used up a lot of yellow, so that's where you need it is.
This imaging, not looking at pictures, but actually.
No.
It's pretty how we're having different people.
You're editing and you have ladders and backpacks.
You want to get homeless.
Yeah, I think that's the best possible.
But still, you've got to have, it's got to sit in memory.
So if you've got two or three of those open,
because you're working on the two copies on the map,
you can obviously use up to date for them.
Or video editing, then you have a 3D modeling,
creating some old source movies.
Yes.
Oh, that's a fair video.
I think that's a fair video.
I think that's a fair video.
You've got more of those.
You've got more of those in the open source.
You've got to spend on it.
You've got to spend on it.
You've got to spend on it.
Well, if you use old handbrake, actually,
it'll take you to be one of those.
You've got to spend on everything and all the floor.
Of course, still, actually, I think it's not worth the actual.
Hold on a second.
You've got to be on the first five style ones.
A lot of you have to spend on the frame.
You've seen some of those.
You've got to spend on the first movie.
A lot of times for city or church at all.
You've got to spend on the first movie.
That's what I've explained to you.
You've got to spend on the two broad bits.
So you've got to do operations on the broad bits.
So if you're working with high depth video,
you're talking a lot of bits per frame.
And then, if that transition is going over a couple of seconds,
well, now you've got to get into the rest of the frames.
What is it?
It needs to process.
It has to have all that ground once.
The transcoding takes a lot of processing time.
It maps it out of my stuff every time I do it.
I go over one of those.
One of those four.
Yeah, I have to change it.
One of those four bit.
A little circuit processor.
Yeah.
Push that through.
Can I just be happy?
Yeah.
Can I just be happy?
Yeah.
Can I just be happy?
Yeah.
Can I just be happy?
Can I just be happy?
Can I just be happy?
Can I just be happy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just see.
Just up here.
Like I hear from pilots, something.
Like I've got multiple limits machines on the network,
and it's how the client and the server, you know, you know.
You see, we passed up, built around.
Yeah.
We've built it around, and processed it all,
and then your entire Linux network shows up just like a mini cluster,
so it can open the network.
It's pretty cool.
How do you want to launch it?
What did you do?
With just CC.
And the vast if you need to compile things,
and it takes forever to do it.
It's a nifty little client.
It's pretty easy to set up.
You have a server, and then you have a client,
and then the client.
It should be there.
Just pick up little snippets of things to compile,
so it's basically a borrowing that is a hardware of a machine
that's a pretty little cluster in your network.
I know.
I know.
It's an overall video editing.
Has that same feature built anymore?
I think so.
That's a cluster.
Yeah.
There's other ones too.
I think it sounds the full time.
DVD-written.
Integrated that feature a while ago.
If you wanted to transpose something from like raw DVDs
to X-Fid or the X or something like that,
you can shoot a section of frames over to a different machine
or whatever, and then it cuts and yet it can be done.
I have to do a web services.
So anyways, that might also not be easy.
So it's random.
Right.
If you're not doing that sort of stuff,
then you're probably not.
But, you know, it's just pressing the system,
and then I was like,
you take it right away.
I just have to pause.
Why is it 100 bucks?
But what are you using for?
Oh, it's sort of different.
Yeah.
Oh, it's sort of different.
Can I just turn it off or this?
Yes, it does.
It does.
It does catch it a lot.
But, you know, when I look at my computer,
if it uses, I don't know,
five-line mag, the mag,
it's cashing on top of it.
But it's not using more than that.
Well, if you're going to run it also,
it's going to add a two-click layer to a two-click layer.
So, it's going to have to be easy,
because you're going to want to get it.
If you're going to run it on a small cache,
obviously, not forward,
then you need more value,
and I'm going to make you run for it.
I always think that it won't get out.
So, it's true out, actually.
I think I'm using this little,
these are dedicated to the six-minute layer
through cache per,
per socket,
per socket.
Should we go through that?
Well, I'm ready.
So, I guess it's three-month-tricks.
I didn't get my two-month-tricks.
I'm sorry.
I already called you.
All right.
So, how well do you?
Last change in my life,
when I just decided that we're going to start the process
to adopt a baby.
So, big time change, everything.
In terms of the technology stuff.
Thank you.
I bought a book,
then reading out the same thing
that I talked about last couple weeks.
I increased your web drive in a weekend.
There's 20 bucks at the headquarters,
and it's got a lot of cool concepts and stuff,
running a lot of on the CEO,
and different things like that.
I started a paper-clutch campus
from my old search engine out position.
You know,
it's racing traffic by using organic results
and submitting your site to as many directories
as we put things like that.
The concept is the more,
I mean, if you've got your tank set up right,
then you've got your web sites being called by Google,
MSN AOL,
and live,
or pretty much the major ones,
and yeah,
then, you know,
the more submissions that you've been
made to,
global blogs,
or directories,
or domains,
or things like that.
The number of email links that you can get
going to your site will increase the traffic
and increase your ranking.
On the site.
I also started out with a paper-clutch campaign
for my dad's own website.
Using a website called
www.7search.com,
it's been incredibly valuable.
The concept of seven searches they have,
non-used,
or like not well-known search engines,
that they submit their content to,
and then people can bid on a price simple.
So much at Google AdWords,
people bid on a price for certain keywords
that their hand shows up on the site,
or that can cure.
And like,
comparatively,
the prices,
like my dad,
this can work currently in the number one for the,
over-contact.
It's not starting to get time to travel,
but my dad is continuing the official website.
And he's paying 11 cents per click right now,
whereas Google's AdSense is,
I think it's the seven cents per click.
So it's a significantly cheaper,
per click.
And we're getting good results,
averaging 10 or 11 cents a click,
and done 50 bucks into it,
and he's starting getting good results.
I'm pretty good.
In terms of prices,
my wife bought me.
Yeah.
Ooh,
there's $8 of the month.
$8.
Yeah, $4.
$3.
$3.
No.
$145,
$4.
$5.
No, it's $99 a month for the unlimited
nationwide plan for just calling
and then it's $30 a month,
and it's already for the,
the dad plan for $3.
And then,
sex messaging,
they split up,
which is pissed about it.
It's either $5 or $10 or $15.
It's like,
for 200 messages,
it's $5.
And for 1500 messages,
it's for $10.
I think for that,
$15 a month,
extra is...
So that form is more than $150 a month.
And then,
it's $145 a month.
I think that it was the tax.
And then, FCC fees,
yes, your other $65.
$157 was the first one.
Yeah.
But, if you pay that,
with the free money,
you can tell they're off that, baby.
So, just creating a text messaging,
something they don't want you know about them.
They use absolutely no bandwidth.
Yeah, I believe so.
It's all around the city.
It's cute,
but it's all set,
but then,
the phone has to communicate anyway.
It's sex-to-net-off,
and you should set it off so they're just
So they're just making money out of it, no, they do nothing, it's nowhere in the service
they are right now.
This is showing how long that's been there.
And so, what is this which has come, we thought we were going to text messaging, and you
are going to text messaging.
People actually may be going to text messaging at the top, but it's all going to be fine.
Well, that's like kids now, these are the same things that they do.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Shall we go on the news later?
Yeah.
Actually, this news about it is really three weeks worth of news, so they might not be such
a news right now.
But the virtual box, two more models released, it was released for me, because what is in
the center?
Did something try?
No.
I don't think so.
Don't try.
I thought it was interesting that there is an integrated OpenGL acceleration to do it.
It doesn't work.
It does.
I didn't even say it would work, I just thought it would be interesting.
No, I thought it only works for Windows, I guess, Windows XP, and it's something.
It's the first generation around, so I'm still working on it.
64 bits, 42.
I didn't see that happen.

I didn't see that happen.
the correct person.
going to talk.
I think it's on site.
Oh, then there was news about
Andy doing single-�essions off,
driver.
Is that a driver?
No driver.
Actually, what it was was that
Andy set it for ATI,
We're going to release all of the 3D specs and specifications for the cards.
And this was actually, instead of releasing like for the 400 and 500 core,
they just dumped them with, you know, pages upon pages of documents.
And they took a look, the dark part of the year,
it actually goes through documents and the insensitent,
and just now they're starting to get the, you know, drivers to the point
where they're actually using that stuff.
So this time, instead, what they did was they made a reference implementation
for developers that just did a whole bunch of stuff on the 600,
and that's what they released, they released the source code to that.
So they pretty much said, you're starting to do it, go for it.
Cool.
So as you did, they did a lot of people to,
they made a little demo to give it out.
That's virtually what they did.
That's a demo, which is way more useful
because this works, why doesn't mine work?
That versus trying to look at the document,
and isn't it here in the documents, or is it missing something,
or is it a cross reference for something over here,
or you're adding out, or whatever it sounds?
Cool.
Cool.
And that there was open source, isn't free software.
I think it was, wasn't full.
Cisco.
Cisco.
We also have that there.
That's at least a thing that's put down on you.
Go ahead and have your Cisco.
You see that kind of line?
A long-haired relationship with the GPL and Cisco.
The company's just going to get it.
Yeah.
Because you need to get slapped around the floss
and it's otherwise they just don't.
Go care.
Well, some people, people in the company care,
but the company as a whole doesn't,
because the people will never get, you know,
no, tell me.
The ones at the bottom care, but the ones at the top never.
Yeah.
Well, it was at the bottom care on principle,
which is why everyone cares, but the people,
the big execs don't care.
Because it's cost prohibitive,
and there's no real gain from a financial perspective
because the company needs it.
I don't know why, for a long situation, they just don't.
They don't know.
They don't know.
They don't know, they don't care.
They don't know, they don't care.
They don't know.
But the money is in technical form.
It's in technical form.
You're doing the hard to make financial problems.
But then they, people take orders.
They should understand that.
They would make an attention to any commercial license.
You know, to any other license,
maybe you know, if you really look at it,
they don't really follow the commercial license as either,
just because they're in debt.
Not because they don't care.
Maybe if there is a body to be exchanged,
you're going to have, you know, maybe that's.
It's more, the companies are just canned.
It's not that they don't care.
It's not that they wouldn't do it,
but they're just inactive and they can't get anything
done in commercial production.
It's not a high priority either.
I don't think the force is in it.
It's a loss.
And then everybody,
it's a loss.
Yeah, until it blows over,
and then it's right back in business as well.
And they said that's exactly what happened with Cisco.
They complained about it.
They complained about it.
This goes like, oh, okay.
And then they went right back to business as normal.
And they didn't release the next one.
They called on it.
Oh, you did it so well.
Okay, here.
It's like, yeah.
It's like, there was no,
anybody who was thinking,
you heard it.
Right.
It's like, they wouldn't be going there
and resources to, excuse me,
to follow through for all their brothers and their families.
It's probably basic box.
Yeah.
It's basic box for all of them.
Cool.
It's something about Barracuda.
And they have, what is it?
The alternative to the standhouse.
And it is D&S domain name,
but stand block list.
So they are releasing that.
I don't know.
There was a loss in about Barracuda.
They had a main camera list for sure.
I'm sure they put a train,
quite gross.
It's doing Barracuda for,
what is the program?
What is that?
Stand.
Stand.
Stand.
Stand.
Stand.
Yeah.
And there was some,
and I don't know exactly where the loss will be,
so they're still in a delegation for whatever.
So, do we care about this?
No.
No.
Okay.
It's good that they're making the list open,
because they've made a list for one time,
but it's only been available for some purchase
and then the price is set right.
Right now it is open.
And now it's open.
So it's another source.
So, you know,
and that's premium again.
And if you want that support,
we pay money for it.
So it goes for it.
It's right.
Yeah.
The understanding,
the analytical,
new learning certification system,
there was something about user interface
and what is going to be,
how should we be able to be paying attention to?
I would say, you know,
buying the distribution is doing lots of things
that other distributions will pick it up
when it needs to benefit from it.
So, that was already booked off.
The 90% rule.
They had 90% so now they're starting all of it.
They don't break their consensus.
That really is what they were going to do.
They said,
oh, the notification system isn't,
the ink guy isn't quite what we want.
So we started over,
and nothing is going to be backwards compatible.
But it should be okay.
No.
So, progress.
It's going to be great.
It's going to be great.
And there was something about Adobe.
Adobe released Air,
for Linux.
I think it was released at the same time
with other platforms.
So,
if you're careful of that,
I guess the Air is going to be for prison,
you know.
So you write block application
and you can run this web application
and it can run this standoff line.
So, that's all in their own custom language.
I don't think that it's a language.
Is it a language?
Or is it a framework?
It's a framework.
But then if they have their own language on the top of that.
Oh, that's,
it's like writing out.
Is this everything?
Of course.
That may be it.
Yeah.
That's something like that.
Yeah.
No, I've just seen an action.
It's pretty cool.
We're going to deal with the idea of
how to take off,
because it's not,
it's a language language.
When I was,
oh, see,
I think I heard from a developer
that I was in Marshall.
Oh, you're going to have a go?
And then,
at the beginning of the second project,
they were using it.
I don't know.
You know,
I thought that's how he sent out
a wide adaption on the Air.
It seems like it has a lot of potential.
I mean,
I really had to bridge the gap
between all operating systems.
Just doing everything,
either all web app or,
you know,
well, that's an application.
Indeed,
what is the nice thing about it is
that you write on an application.
That's a web application.
And,
you can,
you can present an application.
Hey,
there's somebody in the browser
who will be
as a standalone application.
So,
then,
you're working with a,
with a server in the back.
What's it like,
I do,
so we have a server,
a whole,
lots of them,
a server in the back.
And then,
you can,
we have two sessions.
One,
who's the first one.
Who is the first one?
Who is the first one?
Who is the last one?
Who gives you a different one?
So,
so,
so,
that was,
whatever is there.
Oh,
when I was talking about it.
They,
they are using their own,
the language,
the right user interface,
hit VB,
joke,
capture,
ideas.
F-sharp, do you think it's pretty like this?
Like, you don't know?
Yeah, well, basically, it's a functional variant that sits on the side of the phone.
I'm sure, isn't it?
I can't remember who was F-sharp or who that was, and what did it?
Who's like the most confusing language ever for anybody?
Well, you know, it's the most big there for the other eye group.
It's like music here.
Absolutely.
You know, screen phones are you okay?
I'm okay.
Well, it's someone fun to shoot, is it?
Oh, later on, Microsoft, and the second name, all right?
Or really, it's the after-golder.
Oh, no.
It's just F-sharp.
So, yeah.
It's a bandsaw, it's D-plus, whatever it is, you shut up.
Was it the trouble that you did?
Because F-sharp is the bad one.
He was the bad guy.
Plus, he was the bad guy.
It is the false phone phone phone.
So, this is actually a programming language, yeah.
For what?
It's kind of a scripting language.
Yeah.
Not in that framework.
Basically.
It's a book with a much better, strictly language,
for standard things that you learn as a scripting language.
Who are you going to argue with when you start?
I'm going to argue with a decent, strictly language.
Okay.
I'll argue with that.
I'm not saying it.
I'm not saying who is the great one.
I don't think that thing is the best thing.
Who is the thing there for some time?
That's all right.
Yeah.
The first window shadow is a dancy item.
It is the book that's on the specs.
Yeah, dancy actually, all the it's shadows are written.
Yeah.
It was all on the day.
Yeah, good.
It's all a dancy item.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I haven't changed this drill.
I was going to launch it.
I'm just trying to find the district office as soon as we grow stuff.
Disappointing. Disappointing.
There's some articles about part of the magic.
So I'm using G-Party.
So part of the magic is down here.
So I put it up to part of the partnership.
Part of it.
And this USD field radio star, what it is.
It's a USD school to do open summit.
And then plus year and all the sessions.
We are actually recording.
So on the website there are links to whatever sessions are.
So whatever is going to be paid next week.
They're actually talking about it.
It's paid to make their own people laugh.
If somebody has a lot of time on their hands,
it's like huge.
You can watch it.
Or we can still welcome them.
Yeah, the important on my hand is,
there's a little steam.
Small steam.
Oh, that's a common stuff all the time.
Watching the story of Hans Reiser.
Hans Reiser.
Is that a horror story?
Yeah, it's pretty much the same.
I like the light thing.
CBS weekly special.
I think it was awesome.
Sure.
So I think I already have less engagement.
And Hans Reiser.
Yeah.
The last article there was an open sort of program
with which we support kids.
So if somebody is a kid,
I think it's a regular record.
I go strong.
I don't know why I was even on the list.
I think they're saying that
some of them are different.
So this is the first one to scratch.
Actually, what kind of interesting?
You're going to have to go on
and actually do a screen shot of it.
You said the NYT thing was
supposed to help you.
You might want to make a figure.
Make a firebox.
It's small and good for you.
What does it do?
Well, you get little spring damage
that walk around and fall into holes
and things like that.
Hello.
You can put a hole in the ground
and then have it walk forward
and fall into it.
I mean, you just roll around the pieces.
Yeah, it's actually...
Where are all pieces?
Well, you know what this actually is?
They're all from their robot code thing.
They're a brick thing that they have a Lego.
Yep, they have their own system.
It's the same stuff.
I mean, they stumble through like
when I was teaching myself a cobalt
like, I used to be in a reference terms
and I never used to
have never been in the label.
It wasn't bad, cobalt.
It was just a better timeline
for parentheses and scheme
than I did in cobalt.
You just did a cobalt.
And cobalt, you couldn't do the
we didn't separate stuff.
We got your scheme and all four.
But everything was in one five.
It was such a beautiful one.
All variables were actually
multiple variables.
I don't know.
Let's keep on doing interface junkies.
So they're actually different
ones.
I think somebody was talking about
Alice in the coffee shop.
Oh, Alice, yeah.
Alice is the CME thing.
Actually, it's better.
It's not quite as kids stuff.
I thought I took a quick look at that.
It was a little better than
some of those things.
And I don't know about those.
I don't know.
She was in the workforce.
She looked at me.
No.
You should suggest using that.
I will.
No, I actually take off.
Yeah.
Exactly.
No, no, no.
Then why is that?
I'm sorry to say that.
You try to use your own plan for one thing.
It is. Sometimes.
It's a good way to do the job.
I have to do some of your programs.
You definitely do.
We had a talk about TNC.
That was the last time.
You're using this?
Yes.
We're not using it quite that much yet.
Okay.
Not to give me the full rundown.
But it looks like it should be very nice.
That's one of my ideas.
Do you think you're doing good?
Yeah.
It's been a long day for me.
She does stuff.
Yeah.
That's why I need to do stuff.
I need to do stuff.
I need to do stuff.
If you have a visual based user in a place.
You know what we do.
We have to do the VVUE.
We have to get the idea to address them.
We don't have any problems.
I know.
You have to be real fun.
There was article that the G.
The G.
I got one.
Yes.
She added a little small file for windows.
So if you use it in windows.
When windows doesn't really have a good ender programs.
There's one.
I don't really like that.
There's no pan.
There's one.
I've never come across no pads, bugs.
There's some good programs.
This one is called cool today.
The other one is Insurance Guest 있으면.
They go on windows and say, I need you.
I can charge all of my stuff.
Is it wonderful?
On my phone.
Nobody was along with the ride?
There's one online getting back killer's trans problem
Back venge avanz right?
That doesn't work.
There's one which I use in Windows. It's called an ED.
It's German, an ED. I love it.
That doesn't work.
I just import everything in the clicks now.
It's good.
I wish it closed.
You just opened something up.
But, you know what I mean?
You're going to get more of a seed drive as a project.
You're seed drive.
You just go for it.
Well, I'm sure it never told about that.
Yeah, there's not much to say.
If you really want to see how crazy some of this stuff is,
look at some of the dependency you have for Debbie and packages.
Somebody made a map of Kermel.
And it was like 40 feet long and 3 feet or 4 feet wide.
It looks like the stuff is just going up.
This is all the bad news that are related to the revenue source of January.
I mean, this is the best.
Well, you know, this is deep in your appreciation of aptitude and synaptic.
And what they're trying to deal with to get those things to work.
They work well.
You know the self-processors you have to see a certain story on the wall.
I'm just saying, speaking of self-processors, here's a common story found.
Do you want to read your story?
I can't say.
Are you interested in this cup of coffee?
Yes.
If you actually talk about, I think you can talk about this.
Yeah.
I think we're on that.
I found some interesting stuff on there for each game.
So if you're interested in learning about each game,
it's a perfect sight for you.
Control center, can you have system settings?
Oh, we were talking about the cultural centers.
Well, somebody was actually writing, you know,
how other people are doing whatever they are doing.
So I guess it was probably usability for a review.
I suppose I'll share about it.
This is just an article that I should have been asked.
Is it like a review?
No, I think he asked what somebody did.
There's a thing we bother with.
There's pretty much a rebuttal on people who say,
everything should be in one place.
Well, these guys don't do it.
These guys don't do it.
I don't know.
That's whatever.
It's just trying to read on all species.
It's like a human ear interaction.
It's a little bit weird.
I think the computer and human hop are natural anyway.
So what do you learn with this book?
What are we doing?
I see it all.
The Bible Bureau is born with me.
They were actually able to just recently
produce what somebody was seeing on computer screen
by reading their brainwaves.
Yeah.
That's scary.
Actually, they have legal and forensic things for that.
There was a case where they actually convicted some guy
because this brain scan thing said that he recognized
a scene of crime where he was claiming he hadn't been.
And they convicted this.
It was like, you know, DNA kind of use of...
How did you watch the movie?
You had up there anyway.
We're rehearsing it.
No, no.
What they used, they showed you a virtual reality
of the image of a location.
And if they're claiming, they don't bring it up.
They don't bring it up.
They don't bring it up.
So if you were there in person or make a solid picture...
Well, but that's the point.
I think this is bogus, but the point is they're claiming
that this will be like a lie detector test,
whether or not you are familiar with the picture.
We all lie into the digit because our...
Well, that's right.
But they still convicted this drive based on it.
So like that will cement movie related...
Just to see that coverage in my country with a question.
What's the movie?
Will it lead to the...
The Wild Wild West?
Yeah.
And they got it put to land, and they got it.
They got it by some last name in town.
The last name in town is Ahay.
That's one of that cell in the rock.
Great.
Well, it's...
It's very weird, but it really raises questions about basic liberties.
Because I mean, for example, you're not required to testify
and say something that will criminalize yourself.
But you can't prevent them from taking a DNA sample,
which could have criminalized here.
And I don't know about that.
No, I don't know.
Now we know the same thing about that.
Right now.
You know what I was talking about?
The fact that it was based on that.
That's it.
Cutter.
I think it was called.
There's like...
You could have at birth, there was an option to employ in some small ship
that basically recorded every moment of whatever that person saw
for their entire life.
And his job as a cutter was to sort of crop and edit the whole life
and divide everything up into categories.
And then his job was basically a giant video editor of everything
that that person ever saw in their entire life.
Well, they make like a video summary for the funeral.
That was the concept in the movie.
It was...
What were you talking about?
Did you cut your head off?
It's Robin Williams.
Robin Williams.
You remember this?
Yes, it was.
It's my only...
I think it was...
I think it was part of the movie.
It was a little...
It was a little of the same thing for you.
You guys are...
No, we're not.
So now we're just giving it to the auto-signal.
You have a ship in control of that.
I gave you control of that.
I gave you control of that.
I gave you control of that.
I gave you like...
I gave you a coach.
I gave you a coach.
I gave you a coach.
I gave you a coach.
I gave you a coach.
I'm...
You know what I'm saying?
They added an auto-signal because we Modigned.
They gave us a little...
Love.
Pressurization.
It's written infangацион.
People just go away.
They actually don't get a stat trait or nothing.
it's just going...
Actually, well, all they do...
What they should do, it has an auto-signal.
So, as one word actually knows the applying...
This is actually started by developers.
Yeah, midst of the auto-signal.
You'll get people with plenty ofmissions
through the camera with beginning the picture of самое.
I think that it sounds like each time I'm in a cell and I've got to talk with the final cut this evening.
So you guys next week, thanks for having us here.
We, uh, we're gonna talk about music brings, if you bring, uh, all the service,
all the service, it's the screen screen.
They're all the same, they did so.
They did so.
And here we have a little flinics wallpapers.
There's not many other wallpapers there.
That's one of the better ones I've seen.
It's one of the best wallpapers I've seen.
It's a little grayer, maybe.
It's probably not.
Okay, let's go.
Mmm.
Ah, that was a good one.
That was a good one.
Uh, just as I, there was something called open wallpapers.
Mm-hmm.
Actually, well, about word files.
Yeah, open wallpapers were interesting.
I mean, you know, if we want to get the phone, the cell phone companies not to abuse
or are right, so we ought to know more about open wallpapers.
Yeah.
I'm going to buy open wallpapers.
It's a project to develop operating systems and applications for cell phones.
We have open, open source.
They sell a really nice developer kit.
You get a phone and all the stuff you need to flash the RAMs, ROMs and stuff like that.
But do I have to pay extra if I want dual to really help?
Just as a service to me to take information about where I am, where I am, where I am.
Well, that's what they're working out.
I mean, you're trying to make it so that folks can't just dictate what the cell phone company is doing.
I thought that it hasn't got to be a worker problem.
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
But I mean, see, that's the thing.
The cell phone is a nice idea.
It's too bad the cell phone company is spoiling.
You know, so.
The interesting movie about the abilities of the cell phones over here is the light of the film.
Yeah.
On Google Live, it came out recently.
Oh, really?
That came from Transformers.
Yeah.
I think so.
It's a really cool movie where basically this secret government supercomputer,
basically active-based, and frames him for having all sorts of illegal terrorists,
equipment, skin, piece of apartments, and it sort of convinces him to do all of these different things for,
along with about a half-minute dozen other people to try to put together a scheme to kill the president.
But it's all based on the concept that the government now has the ability to listen to anything you say through your cell phone.
You've been wanting to hit the shuttle.
You know, you want to shut off.
But they've had that ability to do that with your regular landline for two,
for two years.
That's right.
You just grab a coil like that on the wire outside.
You're in.
And then when they're in,
that's what's going to happen.
That's what's the effect they can pick up on the factory, and then see what we're going to do.
Yeah, because they weren't sure if she wanted to.
It was actually that today,
there was even something about Bushism.
Tiger or Christmas is a Bushism.
Oh, actually, no.
There was like two books out before you came present on Bushism.
So, here it is actually.
They misunderstand.
Misunderstand.
I guess we used that quote today.
The last one was, you know,
I understand small business growth.
I was one.
Yes.
What are you talking about?
Education, you know?
Is that what you're putting on your family?
No, no.
No, that one.
I'm not sure if that one.
Oh, really?
It was good though.
I was something.
What do you mean?
I mean.
Why are you talking so many times about that?
Yeah, it'll be long.
I'll be long gone before some smart people ever figure out
what happened inside of this old wall office.
So, I'm just kidding.
All I can say is one of the government calls,
and the answer is about it.
I've decided, I've decided what it says.
Yeah, that's the one I like.
Yeah.
Actually, it was important for us then.
I do.
Today, I do.
No, it wasn't to me.
It wasn't to me.
It wasn't to me, it wasn't to me.
Oh, okay, there they are.
Okay, down to my brother, the government of Florida.
Yeah, this is the center of the second time.
Really?
The third time?
It's the chart.
Yeah, the chart.
Anybody see the HBO special on the digital voting systems?

Yeah, it's actually, I think that's mislegal though, because the movie technically is just called
Take that, that's what I thought too.
Yeah, it's the story.
It's not good with this one.
Yeah.
But it's still great.
I love it.
Well, it's a lot better.
Well, listen to the original song.
Yeah, I heard this before.
When I first downloaded it, I was like, is this the wrong movie?
Is this a band?
Yeah.
So that's what it's sending underneath.
So it was labeled hackers too.
So I'm going to be out.
Okay.
And there was something about personal financial applications for the next one.
Yeah.
So they're talking about six of them.
It's taking a personal...
Yeah, we can say it's a grizzby.
The only documentation is French.
Any problem there?
And you can't change it.
You can't get really euros, everything that you put in also being euros.
Oh, you know, you'll have your converter going on.
Coming out.
You're just buying the right ones.
It's better than my used phones money, I'll say to the court.
You're not going to skip them if you're not going to skip them.
Yeah, you know, they used 200 PS3s and self-processors therein to actually perform this picture,
let's do that.
Yeah, those are self-processed every second.
So that was about what they did specifically.
What they did specifically was they essentially they found an update to the, I don't know how,
if I may be right at the end, in fact, actually not a good one.
It basically means improvements to the sub-expiration in terms of collisions,
which allow them to basically duplicate a specific authority.
There's also some random information, which is what they're doing, self-processors.
But as a result, they were able to produce a valid insert of hash,
and yet illegitimate certification, which would allow for a perfect manual attack.
So we're pretty, we're just going to start that as a big reason why a lot of the CAs now come along,
and you probably will work with the hash, you know, right?
It required a job.
But it'd still be fine.
Oh, yeah, so round, well, I remember talking about these vulnerabilities in school
and my professors even explained that, you know, if I was a travesty,
then anyways, I'll use these algorithms enough.
A theoretical factor is enough.
And we have two algorithms.
Great, I think encrypted data is not my share.
Is that the five, right?
I think so.
You check it out.
Well, actually, you know, kind of use the sign of the type that they used to do the surfboard was in Brazil.
That's the surfboard.
That's the surfboard.
Yeah, so maybe not.
And then back to the rest of it with Tomado.
And the video Tomado.
Sorry, perfect.
That's a perfect stop.
All this is known and actually two of the education using my SQL as a pack.
So you have users.
The point is something that helped me with web data.
Is that, let's say, webdav stuff?
Is there a good tutorial for that or something?
I'm not sure there is.
What is web data?
It's essentially the app.
Well, there's a thing called sync places, which syncs your passwords and your bookmarks from various machines.
The nice thing about it is it works from any OS.
The authentication, I can't get into it.
The only real experience I have with it was working with form and portal.
Actually, webdav to access the portal.
So that's a pretty limited experience.
I don't know if that's a really good balance.
So you have to be happy to get it to work pretty wide open and then start to tighten it up as I go.
But I can't get it to work at all.
It's a minimum way to make sure that the machine will allow access to the right access to the other machine.
I'm not sure.
I would have for just a general context.
I don't think it would be so.
Well, there's a lot of stuff.
What about this guy here?
This is the guy, why I'm brewing right now.
You have to be honest with him.
I'm just going to have to do it.
So I'm diving out.
So there's all your booths here.
Yeah.
There's a talk about it.
When it's hacking, where do you get it?
A hacking beer.
No, I think it's a culture.
It is free format.
It'll get to work whatever we want it to work on.
Well, I think we are going to wrap it up.
I got a question.
Okay.
Does anybody know when you do address or programs?
Like just remain ahead.
Yeah.
Well, you have to get a bird or you can put it really deep for something in the belly of an email plant.
Yeah.
Not really under a long time.
I really want something that's maybe something that can be integrated with an email plant,
but I'm not looking for an email plant.
You know, remember for what it's called, there were some good articles out there about like pda-syncing.
You know, there's a couple of independent ones.
I'll see if I can do some research.
I'll see if I can find some of those three lessons.
Most of it would be integrated with an email plant.
I don't know.
I could take another 100 bird and see.
Maybe that.
