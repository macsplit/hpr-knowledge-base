Hello hyperbublic radio listeners, this is Tony Hughes in Blackpool in the UK and as usual
I've been working with a couple of weeks ago and as my recent interview series has come to an end by the time you listen to this
here's a short review of a USB 3 2.5 inch HDD stroke SSD caddy I got from ebay a few weeks ago
as many of you who've listened to my previous rumblings now I frequent a local computer auction and recently they had some cheap 128 gig SSDs for sale
and I managed to pick several up at the good price after using a few of these to upgrade some desktop PCs to SSD
I had a couple of these spare and as I have USB 3 on the main laptop that I use thought it would be a good to be able to use one or two of these as portable storage
not even for boot drives to test out the old Linux distro or two
so I had a search around on ebay and found one that looked okay and at the right price and I purchased it for Â£5.50
and these are linking the show notes to the particular caddy I got
so after it arrived I plugged it into one of the drives and tested it out
the first thing to notice is that the SSD is being 7mm in depth flop around a bit in the case
but this is easily resolved with a bit of card or blue tap under the drive just to help it snuggle in the case
it does also mean that the case will support the larger 9mm depth to 1.5 inch spinners if needed
I've not tested a larger older spinner but I suspect they won't fit as 9mm ones are very snug in the case
anyway the drive was detected without any problems on the PC and laptop and works flawlessly
and it's really quick to swap out the drives in the caddy
so it means that I can carry large data files and my music and video library went on the move
with the advantage that it's less likely to get damaged if accidentally dropped or knocked off the surface
which is quite likely with portable spinning HDDs
and I've dropped my current couple of portable spinners a couple of times and been lucky to get away with it
so I'm very happy with this purchase
it's already become a part of my regular kit to travelling toolkit and in the laptop bag
and will continue to be and I'll probably purchase at least one more so that I can have a couple knocking about in the bag
and one like I say possibly with me music and some videos for when travelling
so that's it for this episode I'll record something else in the near future
saying goodbye to all the listeners in HPR land and speak to you soon
bye
