I have 1829.
You want to ask for our math work?
A couple of things there are some interesting things going on with the free Linux PC project.
The Picket County Board of Disability and Special Needs is wanting us to essentially set
up computer lab so we're thinking something similar to Sterling.
Also, prevent child abuse Picket County is wanting us to come help them with their internal network
and set up.
If you are interested in doing any of that, if you want to gain experience doing some stuff,
you can certainly get involved in that.
Or if you just want to help out a relatively worthy cost.
But we need computers so if you know of a company that's getting rid of computers,
we would like to have some.
And we would like to have many, many.
And as far as I know, that's all that I have.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Just for GFATC, that's Google, Spark, Broad, and Anderson technology.
They have a couple of events coming up.
Tomorrow, they have a learning lunch over at the Crown Plaza.
And it's going to be about cybercrone.
And they are having their FBI special agent in charge of South Carolina coming in and talking about cybercrone.
So tomorrow, it starts at 1130 and it usually goes to about 130.
Then on the 16th, which is next week, there's going to be tech afterpods.
And what this is, is it is just networking for the technology community in Greenville, Spark, and Morgan Anderson.
And the first drink is free.
And he brings up a business card.
And so you often just come on up and hang out at the second level of Barley.
So that's next week.
And my employer is paying for this coming week's spear at tech afterpods.
So if you want a free beer on my employer.
I don't want my picture taken winter.
You can repeat, I'm sure.
Phil's hard to repeat, so Jeff.
It's true.
Anybody got any more announcements?
We have this weekend.
This weekend is when they moved the period and stuff up at the Roseland site.
The period astronomical.
And that sort of needs to get hit.
Can't at all.
He was going up there besides myself.
They opened that on Saturday morning.
What are the inspections right and early at eight o'clock?
What are they moving?
They're making Thursday to Saturday to Saturday.
Five or less, right?
So they're looking for a few strong backs in a couple of weeks.
They're putting in place a 100 plus terabyte sand that weekend, too.
So there's lots of cool things.
I think we're going to have a couple more like minutes at least so you can go ahead and repeat that.
All right.
May I have a dance?
All right.
Well, welcome to the link.
You just heard the announcements already.
This is how to fry bacon and shell scripts.
So part two of our new recession on shell scripting.
I'd re-listen to what I did last week and got some improvements this week.
So what do you say to me?
You say, Jayce already know how to fry bacon in Linux.
How do I shell script that?
Well, first of all, what is a shell?
And outside of Linux, outside of Linux, Unix and computers in general, what would you say a shell is?
What is the word container?
Container.
For example, you have anyone?
Clam shells.
Clam shells, which are the outside for the clam and another shell might be like that.
Corn?
Corn shell?
Corn shell?
I think that as a husk, but okay, you can think of it that way.
A nutshell.
A nutshell, thank you.
That's what I was looking for.
So what the shell does is it wraps around is that it's an external interface that wraps and hides and protects the inside.
That's in general nine computers.
It protects in Linux and Unix in particular.
It protects the kernel, which is another word that means multiple things, but not a grab ever.
So the kernel is the interface to all the hardware on the computer.
It gives resources out.
And the shell is your interface into that.
Now, in Unix, you've got two different kinds of shells.
You've got this command line shell, which is what I'll be giving a presentation on.
And then you've got the GUI shell.
Windows just has a GUI shell.
Well, I guess any power shell.
They still have a command line.
They have a command line, but I don't know if you can consider this shell.
Some of you said that.
There's this shell for the end of the day.
It's the desktop.
Yeah, okay.
You actually did.
Sure.
Okay.
So a script is all the shell commands together into one thing.
So you can just, instead of having to type, there was some one multiple times.
You just run the one thing.
So let's take, for example, I've got this, uh, remote shell script.
So I want to just, uh, I'll just stick from the command line.
And all it does is it echoes, frying bacon to the up.
That's, um, that's where you already know how to do fry bacon.
But if I run, if I run this command, the shell script, it does the same thing.
Because you see here, it's, uh, that's all there is to it.
I've got a handouts too.
Oh, wait, how's it going to do?
Sorry.
This is for, uh, accessing later.
Are you, are you recording me?
Uh, or is this just one shot?
No, we're recording you.
Yeah, I know that, but are you, is this okay?
Well, you got my backside the whole time.
I wish I didn't know that.
And I would have, uh, put some best of mine.
You said not to enjoy it.
Thanks, sir.
You said not to get your face.
I know.
I was, I thought you were getting this face.
All right.
So the simplest script is just, uh, and I'm just going to use the echo command.
You see there, you got, uh, the fried one.
You see, it's all it does is just to, it echoes to the screen.
The string fried like it.
All right.
So that's the simplest.
So now let's go a little bit further.
Anyone have any questions by the way?
And let me crown rules.
Newbie session.
Anything goes to any question.
Any point to say, I don't know what quote means.
Yeah.
Anything.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
So now let's, uh, here's a.
All right.
So now let's go a little bit further.
Um, in the shell, one shells you can have variables.
Actually let me, let me give it back up.
And I'll go with my comments.
All right.
So, the last month you remember I talked about the Shibayan, which is this right here,
the pound, the estimation point for it's right.
The first two characters, first two bytes, I guess, in any file, start with those two characters,
then the operating system knows that it should execute whatever's after that to be in the line.
That could be the interpreter for the rest of the file, okay?
Does that make sense?
So in our case, we've got shell, bin shell, which is where the shell command lives in the bin director of root.
And it's going to execute the rest of this. Any questions?
Yes.
In the context of Linux, what is prime vacant?
Well, you know, prime vacant.
It's, I don't know, I have to have a clever title so that people can show up.
It's my clever title to have people show up.
If you're using opinion three, it gets in an infinite loop.
That's right. There you go.
Let's just put a little slab on top of it.
Actually, this thing, I think, could do really well with that.
Okay.
I spoke to you remember, I talked about the shabang.
Normally, comments start with a pound sign and go to the end of the line with the exception of the first line,
which is if the first two characters are a sharp bang for panel instrumentation pointer.
Hash.
This is the interpreter for the rest of the five.
Okay. Any questions on that?
So comments start with the thing.
Hash pound symbol.
Go to the end of the line.
It's going to, the shell is going to ignore that.
It's useful because, like me, next time you come back in here, you know what's going on.
You know, you want to go in here and say, what is this park doing right there?
That's what that's like.
Okay.
Now, here you notice I've got two other comments.
Start from the hash mark.
It's the end of the line.
It's ignored.
It's thrown in whenever it's interpreted.
Okay.
Any questions?
No.
We'll talk about comments.
We'll talk a little bit about variables, but I'm going to go a little bit further than that.
When you, the shell has variables.
Once you can define being anything.
And so, from the command line, I can do anything that goes nothing.
And then I go anything that gives me nothing.
Right?
I need to choose different words.
Yeah.
Let me see.
Yeah.
Let me just come back.
Hey, how's that?
I go.
Yeah.
It gives me a comment.
All right.
So that's what variables are.
Now, variables are case sensitive.
So, like I've changed the case of the last character.
And that variable doesn't exist.
So, you didn't know what to print.
So, you're printing nothing.
All right.
So, now I'm in the program here.
I've got, oh, and one other thing you'll need to notice is that right here, I did not put any spaces after or before that equals me to sign.
And the reason you do that is if you do that, it's going to think that you're giving it a command.
The first token is a command and the rest of the arguments to that command.
Now, since the command del doesn't exist, it doesn't know what to do with the command I found.
Does that make sense?
Oh, I know it's sharp.
I thought I'd have to look.
Okay.
So, if you ever get that and you get a command I found somewhere in your script and you don't know what's going on,
then that's what's going on.
So, the spaces are acceptable inside of the script file.
They are not for the same reason, because what is doing is simply interpreting.
It's just from the same as the command line, you know, it's just interpreting it this way.
The space is where the space is seven, four after the email sign.
Okay.
I don't have any.
All right.
So, that's variables.
Now, you reference your variables with the dollar sign in front of them.
So, right here, I've got the variable Meet.
And I've got the string Bacon.
And then, here, where I'm reversing, the dollar sign Meet.
Here, I've got Method.
It goes Fry the string.
And here, I reference it again.
Now, you know, there's two different things.
I've got double quotes here, single quotes here.
And I hear you notice I didn't have any quotes.
I'm glad you asked.
The difference is, with a double quote, that's a string that is one item that can be interpreted.
If there's variables inside them.
And a few other things.
Okay.
Quite off the top of my head, and I'm not bananas.
But if you were to put a method inside it here with the dollar sign,
and then it would also interpret it.
Let me show you what I want.
I will give a point.
The word there is anything that one quotes is.
The inside is interpretable.
The inside is a single quote, because it's taken as the error.
It's literal.
Yes.
Right.
Thank you.
So this is a literal string.
It's going to put exactly what you put inside the single quotes.
With the double quotes, it's going to interpret it.
And it's a spit.
I'm also not got quotes here at all.
But that's okay, because this is literal.
And there's the data here.
And there's no other tokens after it.
It's a single, single token.
Does that make sense there by?
I'm serious if you all have any questions, feel free to call them.
All right.
Great.
So now, whenever I go through here, variables are quoting.
Okay.
Now I'm doing an echo.
Oh, here we go.
I've got the braces.
Now, why did I put braces there?
Do you mind?
If you know that?
Yeah, good.
Because we need to be, um, with concrete brackets.
That it says that this part is, hey, I'm not part of the string.
I'm variable.
Right.
Exactly.
So this part of it is very long.
So if I run this script,
I'll wait.
This is what we had last week.
What are we doing here?
That you need to give the user information to execute.
By doing?
C-A-M-I.
That's right.
The plus execute.
So I don't want to refer to.
So now you see that the difference is between the last time and this time.
I now have execute rights whereas before I did not.
Right?
Okay.
So now I can run it in this way.
Prime bit.
So now it's off the screen.
Oh, I was going to say that's what the story is about.
Sorry.
So that's just completely my mouth.
That's probably the best place to do the four shots.
I left the Linux box at home.
All right.
So when are you executing this program?
It comes through here.
The operating system says you want to interpret it through BidShell.
It ignores the comments.
It assigns to the meat variable bacon.
It assigns to the method variable fry.
And then it echoes to standard out the variable method in with the string in.
And so the double quote is interpretive.
Same as if it were out here.
So it substitutes this part in here.
Now if I were to change that thought, if you remove all those quotes from the variable definition,
I could say one.
Yeah.
On first places.
Right now.
His example.
Right.
So if I took that out like that.
So it's out?
No.
The ones where you find them.
Oh, OK.
Meat equals bacon.
Method equals fry.
You don't really don't need the quotes.
Not just the things you're showing it.
Right.
So in this case.
No.
But this is some case of course.
I'm not saying that's the one that just came in.
OK.
So any questions about any of them?
OK.
Any questions about any of them?
No.
We have some quotes around the screen.
That's what I was going to do.
Thanks.
All right.
Before I execute it.
What's the going to do?
I'm going to echo it.
It's going to echo the little screen.
That's all right.
That's what I'm going to do.
And here's nothing that's going to do.
If I take this braces off.
And execute it.
What's the letter I'm going to do?
Just bake it.
Just bake it.
Right.
Great.
Any questions up on?
No.
You ought to share it.
All right.
This is not like last month where we had an echo question.
OK.
So now I'll go into a little bit more detail.
All right.
Last time my shabby was a bit shell.
This time it's a min bash, which is on Linux systems.
The default shell.
Bash is an Oregon shell.
It's the born shell with more spit polish.
A lot more features.
OK.
So I've got the.
OK.
Introducing command line arguments.
All right.
Last month I did talk about command line arguments.
But I'll reintroduce them here.
Command line arguments.
If I were to give a fry some arguments,
then the shell uses a zero for the name of the program.
And then from one to all the way on,
the each argument thereafter.
Does that make sense?
So what I'm going to hear is I'm assigning method to be.
Write three because that's what I'll call it as.
Meet will be my first argument.
And then add verb will be my second argument.
Does that make sense?
Any questions?
No.
All right.
Good.
All right.
So that's what that happened.
That's what happens there.
And here again, we got the double quotes.
So it gets interpreted.
And put in.
Put right in here.
All right.
So the next thing is if.
The way if works in the shell,
and you can do this from the command line too,
is you've got if.
Command.
New enough.
Separator.
Then block.
Feet.
That's how that's the syntax of if.
Does that make sense?
Write again.
If.
If.
Command.
Then.
Command.
Feet.
All right.
So that's how it works.
If we'll go through here and it'll stop at feet.
So what does the test is the command that you want to run?
In our case, we're going to use the program called test.
You see, I'm prominent of these out at all.
Address them later.
Test is for the most part.
Probably what you're going to want to use most of the time can give.
What test does is it's a program that takes arguments of a certain type.
Like this one, the equals sign.
It expects an argument before and after.
And what it does is it's a return to true or false.
If they match.
So in our case,
fry free method.
Now we know the method is going to be zero, which is.
Man, I'm not the script.
Yes.
So now there's a little hack here that you'll see a lot of places.
I put a little exit in.
And that is because sometimes if this.
If this doesn't exist before it comes to this point,
this is going to be the empty string, which it's nothing.
And the test is going to say equal, you know, fry free x equals.
Wait, I need another argument.
So that's why you put this little hack.
If method does turn out to be nothing,
it'll return an x and then this will fail.
It will say false, which is a one in the case of test.
And then go to the else part, which doesn't exist in my script.
So it's actually else more commands.
So this is an optional part, which I don't even have.
So that's why it's optional.
Have I lost any money yet?
I've lost no one yet.
We should be going again and be session.
All these other guys have done this stuff.
It's not for this.
One quick test would have been returned to zero.
It's true.
Correct.
All command line programs should return zero for the number of the type of error.
So no error in other words.
The return code for success.
The return code of those commands.
In fact, whenever you do your, I don't know if anyone does a C programming or a C++ or whatever you have in the end,
that's what gets returned back to the shell, which means success.
So test, if this were false, would return one error one.
So whenever this gets to zero, as return code, it goes to the then section.
So I'm going to sign in the then section method, fraud to be that.
And then I'm going to echo it out here.
All right.
So that's if test.
All right.
So I've talked about test the program.
Now, you notice I got up here.
Two of the variations of the exact program that's called test.
And test is, if you look in your bin directory, you will find a program called left bracket.
Left square bracket.
And it's the same as this.
It's either symbolic or whatever.
If you use it in this format, you need to have the closing time.
All right.
Just, it makes it curry.
All right.
Um.
Just wait.
Okay.
And it takes the same kind of Artemis.
There's a lot of different things that test do.
And last week, we talked about built-ins.
I don't know.
There's some differences between the built-in test and the test that is in bin.
But I'm not going to go into that.
You know what you're in.
Hey, what's up?
I don't know why the equals is actually two equals.
Right.
Yes.
The test that is in the GNU, the GNU test that you'll see in Linux also understands the double equals.
So that's for old C-programmers that know that double equals means is equal to instead of is assigned as.
So you don't confuse it.
So the positive standard says that this is right.
But test understands the bottom.
In the Linux system.
Did you recommend the used test?
Did I understand earlier that you recommended using test?
It's ghostly.
I didn't recommend.
Okay.
One way or the other.
I mean, it's up to you which word you would use.
In other programs, whenever they're writing shell scripts or interpreting shell scripts,
they also interpret brackets to be something else.
So sometimes you want to use test instead of it.
Yeah, I'll come across it.
Like when you're putting it in a wiki or something like that, you got it.
I guess I would, you know, I'll tend to use a double bracket which forces it to use an internal.
I'm not going to go into which is less over here.
But that's, yeah, I'm not going to go talking with it.
Okay.
Next week.
I've got to work first.
Work better later.
All right.
All right.
So we're testing if the strings are stringed.
And I've got the test white space.
Okay.
Now here.
You know what I've got?
This huge long line with a lot of white space.
I've actually got two tabs here in space space.
Then this and all of them.
What's that going to print out?
Shall we find out?
Let's find out, Jayce.
I'm talking to myself.
All right.
So I'll be throwing a tree.
And that's the first one you're going to need to meet.
It'll just print a space delimited water.
Because the tab would have to be specified with the slash.
All right.
Well, aren't you giving me a meet?
Someone had done cat.
Cat?
Yes.
I know the cat loved her.
Why do I mention it anyway?
Anyway, okay.
And a method for cat.
We're making cat to eat stir fra.
Stir fra.
Oh boy.
Mission to none.
Okay.
All right.
So I don't have X-Dude.
Right.
So this one as well.
But there's another way to do this.
I can do a chill.
I can do a chill.
I can do a chill.
Fry.
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
It's a weird stir.
Okay.
So, oh, I didn't do any argument with you.
Cat.
Stir.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Is our guest here?
All right.
Okay.
So now what happened here?
All right.
So argument one went in.
And it's there.
Argument two went in.
And it's there.
That's cold.
The space is a little bit.
But yeah.
So the space is about gone, right?
They weren't interpreted.
Because what it is, is that code takes the shell.
Any command of the shell takes arguments.
And it doesn't care about having spaces between the hundreds that you have.
So it dropped out all the tabs, all the spaces, all through and here.
Now, what if I want to keep the spaces?
What do I need to do?
You could do the escape character before or before you could do a quotation mark before.
Right.
We go back to the quotation mark.
If I want to have a literal, I don't want to do that here, right?
Because I'm variable.
So I want to use the double put.
And put it in here.
And then that way, if we've got one string that gets sent to argue,
the echo is one argument.
And it's a interpretive value.
Okay.
So.
But now, wait a second.
I was expecting something else right here.
Because it tests five, three x equals method x.
Method was.
All right.
So method was zero.
Now, when I went to the shell, this would be zero.
This would be one, two.
Method zero, method.
Right.
That's correct.
It should be.
Now, is that all right?
Why did I get this?
It came out as a zero.
So if zero, it's going to jump over.
So this test said, wait a minute.
This is dot slash, right?
Three.
You've called.
You've called shell instead of.
I don't know if that.
You're right.
But shell is called that.
That's right.
That's right.
Exactly.
Exactly.
So I did the.
I did it with the dot slash.
Now, since I'm using the shell, I can do it this way.
Where's my frying.
With the capital as instead of that dot slash fry.
Does it make sense?
All right.
Because I've got the test.
Didn't match because I had a dot slash in front.
This is a literal string.
Okay.
I'm going to do one more thing.
Can't find the frame.
Ultimately.
Fine cats.
They're fraud.
Thank you sir.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
No.
You don't have to be.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You're right.
Fine cats.
All over.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fine cats.
That's what I was expecting.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, if I don't give it that, then that's where you get no effort.
And that's what it is.
Test.
One of the commands that test, or one of the arguments that test take is zero length adverb.
So it tests if adverb is zero length, which in this case, you know, it was because there was nothing there.
It makes sense.
This returns a zero to this, which means false.
I'm sorry.
This returns a zero.
True.
True is not zero.
True is zero.
True is zero.
No error.
If it says it goes into here.
And there was no effort.
And here's the third type of coding, the backslash.
You see I've got quotes here, so it gets interpreted.
No, only this would be adverb.
But since I've got the backslash, I've quoted it out.
I learned it as quoting.
There's three types of coding.
Don't quote.
See you quote.
Backslash quoted.
So you're quoting the character.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It says.
All right.
One last thing.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
All right.
Rust.
We do the same thing.
Now there that goes back to the.
You had asked.
Why would I want to even mess with bell sound zero?
Well, what have you got?
Symbolic link.
Arnold link.
Same program.
It's going to be.
Fry free.
Whenever you run it is fry free.
It's going to be rust.
Whenever you run.
That's rust.
And then you get it.
Rust again.
Any questions?
Yeah.
Are there going to be some audience today?
No.
Thanks.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's actually.
I'm going to pronounce of the stuff they don't want.
And he did something really geeky.
He's actually did all the work on his exo laptop,
which he DNC into with someone else's laptop.
And he then project on the screen.
I tried to.
I didn't work because it was so huge.
Well, he did have it working before people showed up.
Okay.
Are yours.
All right.
And for those of you who don't know, although I assume by all the faces.
I assume that you chose the fictional character's name.
Well, it's a bit of a story.
I'll probably get into it.
Okay.
I first heard about him when he was doing Google Earth.
Yes.
He was on BitRev Radio.
And one of our list member's groups.
And if the other guy was in the interview,
and he Christobona probably.
Or, no, this was binary revolution.
This was a no.
Yeah, it's been a long while.
But I had no idea it was in Charlotte.
And then we had to point it out that he's in Charlotte.
And I haven't been fired.
And we're thrilled to have him.
All right.
I'm glad to be here.
I couldn't find the place.
I was terrified.
The old stuff.
Forward and left.
Thank God.
There was a dash tutorial going on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
