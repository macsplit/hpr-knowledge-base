Now let's do it!
Hello and welcome to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
This is Pokey.
I'm coming to you Dave Yates style today from the car for what is for me an uncharacteristic
show, a short one.
I figured out something really cool today and it was a neat little hack that I thought
maybe like I don't know one person might be interested in but I found out how to totally
game those little find the differences games they got them they got like I was playing
a free one on my Android phone or I know like the heaven bars sometimes and people are all
impressed if you're any good at them but I found out how to do those things very very easily
if it's a side by side picture at least I don't know about a top to bottom I haven't seen
one of those where they split the screen top to bottom but if the picture goes side by side
try looking at the thing just the same way that you would look at one of those old magic
eye posters where one eye looks you know your left eye looks at the left one and your right eye
looks at the right one at the same time and then you kind of focus in on it it's not that hard to
do with a little bit of practice but if you do that the differences pop out at you like they're
in 3D if there's been something removed or added from the picture it almost looks three-dimensional
a little bit harder to tell is where they don't remove an item but they might change its color
and if the colors are very different from one another then it almost seems to shimmer I guess
might be a word for it I don't know it's maybe takes on like a metallic hue or something I don't
know it looks different it looks weird if the colors real different if the colors are close
or if the thing they change the color on is really small you might not see it that way it might
be too hard to see but otherwise yeah you can you can spot stuff really like almost instantly
you can spot stuff but then if you go to reach in front of your face and tap on the thing because
they're always touch screen games you know if you go to reach in front of your face and tap on it
then your finger will break your focus and the rest of the things you won't be able to find them
you'll have to like refocus your eyes again like that and that actually takes a second but it's
quick if you can do it once spot all the things and memorize but it's usually like five things
at the fine memorize where those five things are and then focus your eyes back to normal and just
tap where those five things where you you won't even you'll do it so fast it's so quick you won't
even recognize what the five things are you're just touching on the five spots on the screen
where things jumped out at you you might not even be able to tell what the particular object was
but I thought that was really cool it was really fun and then like if you can't like I said if you
can't find the fifth thing look for a tomato or a like a pepper or lipstick because those are
things that they like to change the colors on that are real small that's a little more difficult
to notice the change colors and peppers a lot and it's hard to tell since they come in so many
colors it's it doesn't jump out at you immediately no matter which way you do it but yeah I thought
that was really cool I was playing the game on my Android phone and my high score was like 35,000
and once I figured that trick out my very next score was like over half a million if that tells you
anything and then on the timed one I went from like taken maybe 15 or 20 minutes I think I don't
know I rolled that high score off the screen and then like as I figured it out it went from from
that to 11 minutes and then down to five and down to three minutes for the thing that used to
take me like five minutes and then that's after that's when I tried the you know the straight up
high score one in my high score from 35,000 to like well over half a million so I thought that
was a cool trick in pressure friends at bars you win bar tricks that way and just amazing people
and they won't know how the hell you're doing it and and you can have a lot of fun with it maybe
try to win a drink or something or win a bar bet but neat little life hack for a game that I'm sure
everyone has seen or played at least once all right hey thanks a lot that's it for me today
sorry it was less of a serious one but have a little fun with it if you can all right see you
