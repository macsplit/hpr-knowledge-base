This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3685 for Friday the 16th of September 2022.
Today's show is entitled Budget and an Android app.
It is hosted by Archers 72 and is about two minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Soho Docks for Budgeting.
Hello, this is Archers 72 and in this episode I have a budget and an Android app.
I have a budget that I keep on a spreadsheet on LibreOffice and some time ago I decided
to move it to the cloud and instead of using Google Docks, I found Soho.com and the URL
for the spreadsheet is Sheets.zoho.com.
You just create a login to be able to sync between the Soho.com online and the Android
app.
I originally made the document on LibreOffice to include a breakdown by month and also into
week periods and then with headings such as food, gas, internet, cell phone, in my case
it would be rent or your mortgage, utilities such as electric, gas, water and then medical
and eye care, cash or savings for the week, taxes and there is another heading for car
repair and maintenance.
I don't know if this will help anybody else but it helps me at home and also on the
go when I am trying to remember how much I have to be able to spend on one thing or another.
I had an idea to have the spreadsheet fill out the day of the week for each Friday of
each month.
If anybody has any ideas on how to do this, it would be greatly appreciated or if there are
other ways this spreadsheet can be improved, appreciate the feedback.
Well that's all, thank you for listening, bye bye.
