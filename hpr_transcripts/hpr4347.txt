Hello my friends, I'm here to talk with you about my country, that is Brazil.
I will talk under the premises of my limited experience of living, my limited study of
life and of the topics specifically, and I hope you like the information.
Number one, I'll talk about our national health system, SUS, the system I only could
study, would be translated as unifying health system.
It is something that works, any citizen, any person here, that is here in the pendant
of nationality, of anything, has free access to health treatment.
No payment, no check, and if the person has paid the taxes, anything.
Of course, the waiting time may be a problem, if it's not a emergency or emergency.
I had a case where I had to go to a public hospital, at the moment I was already better
of the stomach pain I had.
My neighbors had to call the ambulance, all from SUS, and I was stuck to the public hospital.
Very clean, structured, but it was full.
I would have to wait because on the screening, the triage, I was without bigger problems
for ready service, I didn't need anymore, so I would have to wait three hours for medical
care.
I chose to get home and God bless the pain had not returned.
But of course, many people depend and can rely on it.
Quality of a rise, has any service paid or not, has quality of a rise.
According to the city, if it's a capital or a country town, a more structured or smaller
city, depends on the hospital, the specific doctor and the support team, etc.
It all depends, but we have the national health system for free.
Where to step water, the water that we have in our taps is safe, it's recognized as
drinking water.
At least in my city, I live in a southern city, capital city, and even the water treatment
company that is Sanepar sells their water bottled in drug stores, for example, and sponsors
events like running or other sports that distribute water to show the quality of it, to generate
trust.
Anyway, people don't use to drink from the tap directly, are they use a filter or come
on also to buy water in carbois, that is 20 liters, big plastic bottles, we buy 20 liter
carbois, that is a little more than 5 gallons, the capacity, and drink from it the mineral
water.
I use this option, but I also drink water under the shower or from the tap also, of course,
if mineral water is lacking.
Most people that I know simply don't drink water, I don't know, I don't understand how
it is, but they don't drink water, not even a liter per day.
The most common substitutes, quote-unquote substitutes, are coffee and soda, topic tree in the
half forward program, religion numbers.
Statistics about religion are very misleading, you can find different numbers in different
researches, but more than half identify as catholics, more than 20% evangelical, maybe
30%, and 10% without religion, and another religions with fewer numbers.
But all deeds says nothing about reality, of what you find in the streets and the families.
Only because in some areas it's a shame or embarrassing to identify as 80s, as if you
were immoral and cannot be trusted.
So people without religion, simply say the religion of the family or the generic expression,
Catholic, non-practicing, I said that, and they thought, okay, it's what I am, but what
is a religion that you don't practice, it's no religion at all, but the numbers don't
say that, number four, our law, I am very proud of it, I like that we have what technically
we say positive law, our law is written, do it again, our fourth topic, our law, Brazilian
law is written and detailed, sometimes the law doesn't change, but the cuts decide
in a different manner according to the some years in time, so there is this variation,
but in general, a written law by the legislative power, the parliament, the congress, makes the
mess, the gross, the main thing we need in our daily lives.
If you want to know about our judicial system, for example, or rights, et cetera, it's
everything in the constitution, more than 200 articles, it's very analytical guiding everything
above all the norms, and under it, the laws, and under it, the decrease.
Most of the norms are federal and encompass the entire nation, and it's a reason for
we are being so equal, we may say, in many senses, while living in a country with 212 million
people living, official estimation, from the government, and that represents this country,
48% of the South America continent, one last line about this subject, I hope you're
not finding it so boring, is that the union has the exclusive, the private power to rule
about civil law, a criminal law, work law, and other, and other ones, and other ones that
are limited in the article 22 of our constitution, that gives the power to union, states, and
municipalities.
So the main themes of our lives, the minimum wage, how our relations privately are regulated
in civil law, what are the crimes, and the sanctions for the crimes, everything is unique,
is one, and only the union has the power to determine in national uniformity, so there
is a big area of life that only the union has the power to do, which is good in that sense
that if you want to know something about our country, in terms of regulations, you can
see it written, not that everything is very organized, sometimes there are many laws you
have to search, but it's our form of law.
Now something very specific to my city, a capital city on the south of the country, as
I have said, here you are not expected to say good morning when you cross with a stranger
on an empty street, no hello or good morning to the bus driver when you enter the bus, it's
normal to not do so, in many other parts of the country, country wise, it's different.
For example, I live in a capital city on the north of the country, and everybody expected
you to say good morning when entering an elevator at the morning, what generally makes
people think, you are strange hearing my southern city if you do that, but there when
I didn't say anything, they would call me, oh, he's in polite, oh, he's arrogant.
So you have differences, regional differences.
If I ask for the name of a seller on a store here in Kudiciba in the south, to be more
polite, saying his or her name occasionally like, thank you Hadova for this explanation
or for getting this book for me from the shelf, if I do that, when I am demanding more
attention time to be more polite, saying his name or her name, they ask, you are not
from here, are you?
And I am, thank you for being here in HPR Hacker Public Radio with me and one, may your
heart be filled with love every time.
