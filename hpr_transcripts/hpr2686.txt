This is HPR Episode 2686 entitled Not All About Lender Part 2nd.
It is hosted by Mirror Shades and is about 40 minutes long and can in an exquisite flag.
The summary is a meandering conversation to suit the nerves and warm the sole part to exclamation.

Yeah, there's some interesting stuff on some Ace Play, the original Xero for the Super Nintendo.
And so there's some weird stuff like you can now, there's a few places where you can get
the car up to as fast as you can get it in the turbo run as you get to these little ramps.
And if you can find one that's like sometimes the ones like right next, they're like staggered,
like you ride on the side of the track. Well, if you hit it like in the corner,
sometimes you can jump like whole sections of the track and land over here.
And that got me wondering like, okay, I started an experiment and that's been a lot
of way more time than I should probably admit to, just fucking with that.
And then one day I found there's like, I wonder what happens, will it let me?
Like, I found this one, I can't remember, it was one of the later tracks.
And there's a huge amount of the track, almost half the track that you can jump.
And it's really, really, really hard to do.
I said they're like all day trying to make that stupid jump and kept crashing out of crash.
Now finally I did it and I thought, okay, this is it.
And we'll see the gang crash or something's going to happen.
And it landed it.
And obviously the program was thought of that ahead of time.
So this little weird, you know, in F0, I would like the little section,
like at the very beginning of the track that you can get over and a little
bean comes down and heals your car.
It looks like that except the bean was red instead of yellow or whatever.
And it drives you back.
It drives you back to a certain point.
And it's like, yeah.
But it was funny that they actually had thought, you know what I mean?
Out about it, like, yeah.
You don't skip that, like, now.
Yeah, it's weird too, because like, looking at like,
menu editors or like, map editors, like, different games.
Kind of seem like they're talking to hidden ways to do things.
And you're just, you're piecing together in your head, like,
man, spice up there and thought, like, I don't know, we're going to do this.
I mean, you put it like, and this will bear you there.
And just to see.
Well, it's going to be fair too.
They have the guys that sit around and play tests that
you can find some of those bugs for them.
But yeah, it is still cool.
Yeah, but it's kind of interesting to see.
Not only that, but things that we're like missing, like, the glitches.
Like, apparently.
Oh, like, unfinished levels and stuff.
Yeah.
And filling games.
There's a, there's a, apparently, I was watching a huge video of this.
Where somebody was talking about, in Mario 64,
you have rows of coins that are always in groups of five.
Except for this one area where it's on the floor.
And they thought, like, why did they, why did, why are there only four there?
It's like, every single other batch is on the bottom.
And they started checking the game code.
And the way it happens is certain.
Next slide is in this way.
So I think the position really puts a spawner and then we'll like branch out
and we'll drop down the coins.
And they can do it either in the line, or they can do it in the ring,
or maybe one or two other shapes.
But it's like that one,
the way it was placed, it would drop down.
But since one of them ended up being underneath the ground,
because it was on the right hand, so they just kind of fell off into space
and might be spawned.
And it would be that every time we approached it,
it would spawn out by one of them all through and be spawned.
And they was wondering, so that's a glitch,
like they just moved it out, they'd be fine.
But all the other markers in the game,
there were that certain height,
but this one's like what's really low.
And they got to checking the rest of the area.
I don't know if it's in the terms that the ground on that level
was at a certain height.
But the thing, they kind of went by later in like,
artificially raised that portion of map.
And it's the past to do is there's like a ball spar,
and then it was just kind of like,
the balls go to the track around the mountain.
Originally, they were supposed to go in the other direction.
And they determined this just by kind of seeing where
the spar should have been placed initially,
seeing the angle of the ramp,
and then realizing that it was actually the crease
of the balls to go to the other way.
And then they realized that half the level had been redesigned
around that concept.
All just because there was four points at a five.
And it's like once, when it's been way too much time
on that, and two, someone's been exactly at the top of them.
There's a lot of stuff, even today,
like hidden stuff that still comes out.
I think I read somewhere that there was still one hidden easter egg,
I think, in the original World Combat, that one's found.
Yeah.
And there's some really deeply hidden ones,
still like, because I don't know if it was the first
but there's something like had to defeat
somebody so many times, and then like,
at certain times, at certain levels,
and just certain combinations.
And then like, you fall through the floor,
and then all this other stuff,
and you know, like an additional character,
there's something like that.
And it was just like ridiculous, all the stuff getting built here.
Yeah, there's some really good stuff.
I think the first World Combat,
when it was like the Reptilesman character,
there's a bunch of things that have it on lock him,
or well, you don't really unlock him,
you just get to fight against him,
and then there's a regular playable character in it too,
and there was three hidden characters in it too.
When there was also a movement in it too.
Yeah, there's Jade, Smoke, and Nupesavod in it too.
And the weird thing about World Combat too,
they would have had other weird little easter eggs too,
like if you fought 250 matches in a row,
that would, it would, you'd stop,
and it would let you play like a palm,
like the original palm.
And I think they had a similar thing like that in three,
but it was joust instead of palm,
because midway was the big back there.
Yeah, joust was an old midway game.
That's again, the update for modern generation,
Florida, and that.
joust.
I see the ostrich, jousting thing.
I think it would be cool to see some of the old,
like there were some interesting games like,
I remember my first console was the Tarra 2600,
so like there was,
there were some games like Activision had out that,
like Star Master, nobody remember Star Master,
but Star Master was a weird game because you're in a ship,
so essentially your TV was, like, you know,
you're looking through the cockpit,
but it was like the first person to have a thing.
And you had a star map that you could bring up
and the way you did that, the way they,
because, you know, the 2600's are limited.
There's a switch on the 2600 that switches from color TV
to black and white TV.
Yeah.
And in Star Master,
they use that switch to switch between your regular view,
looking at the cockpit and your star map view.
So, yeah, you flip the switch and there's the,
the map of the area you're in,
and you can, there's, like, these little refueling stations
that you have to hit,
because going to, like, there's little dots
that represent the enemy ships that you have to destroy,
and going to them from the star map,
zoom you there, so it eats up a bunch of your fuels,
so you have to go to these tools,
and you have to dock with them, which is really hard,
because it's hard to keep it on the screen,
and you get it to dock and then refuel your ship,
but, um, they're usually, the enemy ships are clustered,
so they're, like, sometimes,
one's about two's, and it's three,
and you have to destroy all of them.
Once you get all the map cleared,
you essentially beat the gang,
where you beat that,
yet hard in the game,
but it's not, uh, you don't get an ending,
there's no real story,
it just plays the stupid little doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
That's it, that's how you get it.
That's like, you go to the...
You have a prodigy?
Yeah.
There's a, it actually sounds like a
game called, like, a lead, something.
It was a first person space shooter kind of thing,
but there was this whole concept where it's, like,
in order to get to certain areas you had to...
You constantly had to dock,
like, space stations,
in order to refuel,
and when you first do it,
you have to match like the rotation,
and the angles you get to
dock a really specific way,
where you crash.
You crash so many times,
you can finally do it.
But the, the point is you're trying to,
buy cheap and sell, you know,
buy low and sell high,
but like, like, different quadrants and stuff,
you try to like plan out fuel use of jizz
and try not to get load,
buy that by space cars and all that.
And then you can find a sailor
to buy a docking computer,
so you can, when you go to your life,
and then just dock for it.
But the whole point in the game is you still,
you know,
acquired wealth,
throughout the galaxy.
But there's not really much beyond that,
but it's like, you just kind of fly around,
you know, in order to get to like,
the remote edge you have to,
essentially save up,
you know, through quadrants,
in order to,
you know, buy fuel to get there,
and I have to do that.
Some more games you can go, like,
other pocket universes kind of do,
and it's just, you know,
it sounds kind of like that.
It's weird,
and the stuff that came up with on that console,
so,
like, there were some games, like,
Mangle and Mangle II,
that we just, like,
shoot in my game,
it would be interesting to see
that we got it,
or even a tag.
Yeah.
You ever see even a tag,
that was kind of weird,
just weird,
bird things.
And then we'll fly around the screen
and poop on you basically,
and just shoot them.
And sometimes they would,
when you shot them,
they would destroy that reform.
And then it sounds weird,
it's like, you can shoot the wings off,
or you can shoot them in the middle,
and the wings of that too,
or something like that.
They would, some of them,
depending on which level you were on,
you would shoot them
and they'd split in two smaller ones.
And was there like a spaceship at the end?
And you know,
I don't remember
until they ever got to the end.
Let's see if I can find a,
yeah, they can attack with the,
is it old?
So, I remember the yards or the end.
Yeah.
That's one of those things
where it's like,
they can legit make a movie,
just to expand on the back for it.
It's so iconic to like,
yeah,
it's one of those things too,
like as something about that game,
always,
like, you always got the impression
there was this big story
that didn't give it to you.
Yeah.
And you're like,
and you try to play the game,
and you're just this
bug thing.
And,
I mean, you can figure the mechanics out real quick.
There's like this field
that you can stay in,
where you're relatively safe,
which can't shoot.
You're safe from that little
popping of the changes you have in that.
Yeah, you can shoot,
but you can still be hit by the laser
or the saw blade or anything.
But that little,
that little thing that tracks you,
that's what it does.
Like, even though,
like, if you touch it outside the field,
it'll kill you,
but if you're in the field,
and it touches you,
that's how it tracks you
to shoot you the saw blade.
So, like,
you have to sit there
and once it fires,
you just move out of the way.
But.
Hmm.
See, I always thought the,
at least I think it is,
it's been a while.
I was just like,
you stay still long enough,
like, it's huge.
You don't have to worry what it was.
And you just want to sink for,
you're safe in the field,
and that's,
that's kind of where you're shooting.
I kind of didn't really know that it was.
Well, see, I would always do is
because you could,
if you go up on the screen,
you come out the ball screen,
I would just sit there at the edge in the field
and then wait for that thing to get ready to fire
and then just move up
and then,
completely out of its way,
that's where we're here starting.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's what you said.
It's very,
it's racing the middle of the saw,
and it's fired in,
and then you go,
it's over and over and over and over and over.
And then,
if you ain't enough,
you've got a little missile that you could fire.
And once you hit the little thing in the middle,
it would go onto the next stage.
I sit there one day all day trying to
beat the quote-unquote beat that game
and never got to an end,
and it's my understanding
that it doesn't really have an end to it.
It's kind of like two different models.
It's like a,
I would say that's the first thing I was like,
kind of like round-ish,
and then like another one's like square.
Yeah, I was like round and square and flying.
The,
the one that's a rectangular is moving, though.
It's weird, you can't see it.
Yeah. When you start biting it,
the little,
almost moving back and forth.
Yeah.
And then,
but yeah, the color changes eventually
from red to blue,
and coming to you.
Mm-hmm.
I couldn't tell you how many hours I spent one day.
I had the intention of beating that game
and putting it behind me,
and I never did it to the end.
And like,
I probably,
I don't know how many,
let's look this up.
I kind of want another one.
I like 255,
256 to
get to the fuel screen.
Yars revenge.
Kill screen.
What about it looks, though?
Well, yeah, like,
because you can look at the cover like a game
and like the box art,
and it,
it's called like the,
you know,
it's a run out of like,
inset,
nude,
fly around,
like it's a little faster than 10.
You can be chased by this,
like it's just,
there's something there.
They need to expand on the story,
like all the huge layers
just come out and it's like a sequel or something.
All those games are like that, though,
because the graphics are terrible,
so they put out these amazing,
like, paintings on the covers,
like to drive your imagination.
But still it's like,
all the paintings I've only need to expand on,
mostly.
It had some interesting effects, like,
this sound too,
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead,
I'm like, whenever you,
you successfully shot the little ship thing
in the middle of you,
through the shield,
it had this crazy effect
of these weird collars coming together.
You didn't remember that
when I put the transports
to the next stage
and that wasn't moving me away
because I didn't know the 20-hrs suddenly
could even be laughing at me.
I'm not finding the Joe Screen.
Doodoooch
Doodoo...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah
And that blew her away a little bit, but it was funny because like I was all excited to get this and it was the Christmas 1984 and like Spring 1985 the commercials for the NES hit.
So I got my 26th time there like right before the NES dropped. It's like that figure. And then just sort of set the town for my whole life.
I got my NES in Christmas of 88 and that was like I've found out mistaken that well that was a little bit before jesus dropped but still.
And then there was like mobile versions like check that out. Oh that's pretty, pretty sleigh.
They have a pair of the mates and new ones. They're probably like knockoff songs or like official ones. Still it's going to need to.
Yeah.
I sort of what it was like straight back to 3D game. There was a defender. It was like a tarry game that they put out.
It was basically two.
Well the defender was originally an arcade game that was porting the tarry.
Yeah. Fortunately there's a 2600 had a really really really shitty track record when it came to arcade ports.
I mean they had a lot of them and they all suck. Pac-Man ports suck. The Frog and Port suck.
This is a command sent to me.
Let's command one of the two pad on 2600.
So the thing is I first played those games on the 2600.
Yeah.
Well some of them I did some of them I did.
I think I was actually getting out of it because they were galactical.
Galactical.
Galactical.
Yeah.
That was more about the house.
I get out from my cousin like his kid who's over like game town or something.
You know some piece of place like an arcade and it's just like well there's a new arcade cabinet.
Of course I'm going to check it out here.
Yeah.
And it actually played with like the stick in the bottom.
It's just like kind of unworldly.
They get like you know younger kids and stuff like kind of looking like what we can do in there.
Like you know there's playing off with the other flashy games.
I'm like I'm beating the shit out of the games that I'm doing.
And I'm like you just kind of get the impressions like you're a dinosaur.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good time.
I want at some point in the future to probably set up a main box.
Like you can get all the arcade castations.
Like I mean I was a people who did that or at least had played on it.
They were finished it.
But I've seen a lot of people take a large hand cabinets and get the new.
Because there's companies that you can buy the new market or get new ones made like have to customize whatever you want.
You can buy the whole arcade stick with the button to set up and their software.
I think some of the cooler software they've made though for like main front ends or whatever for actual arcade machines for that.
Usually runs on one does unfortunately.
There's some progress being made for like a retro arcade.
It's trying to unify all the game accumulators.
But it's kind of hit or miss.
We're trying to abstract it out.
I think it makes more resource hungry.
So I recently was going to very interesting.
I think any simulator you should probably check out.
Poonies.
Poonies?
I don't know.
It's like beer and then this.
Don't know what the deal is.
I just discovered it actually on slide builds.
What is this?
Isn't that simulator?
I've never seen before.
It could be old.
It could be something nobody even keeps up anymore for all of them.
But it's like I really like the way the simulator set up.
This is kind of nice.
I think I was going to have to be miss.
Oh, that's the target now.
It has to be business.
It's where the little change name of product is.
Like you know, you talk about CrunchBank being amongst the lives.
It's like, why don't we just keep that one?
Well, actually there's a story behind that because the original guy who did CrunchBank
was ending the project.
He said the community wanted to keep going with it.
He said he was fine with that.
But they could call it CrunchBank and call something else.
So there was a couple of the additions of CrunchBank were like named after
when the staff were on his wall door.
There were no old guys on the buckets that heckled or whatever.
And so they were all half bad.
Yeah, so in the same condition of using the buckets they call the bunch of mines after
a bunch of money gave away.
Yeah.
I told you this, but I really like CrunchBank, but I'm not a deadbeat person.
And I like lots of lives, but I just don't like where they've been going.
Yeah.
It's just like a thing I told you.
In the context of the cathedral in Zora, the system D is kind of like a Walmart.
It's like, yeah, you shop there, but it's pretty much just doing it on their chambers.
Yeah.
That's why I can recommend boy units.
You play back here.
It's like open RC scripts or something like that.
They're running something that's in our system D.
It's working on that.
I guess why it pissed me off so bad was that my system D came out.
If we always used to say anything about choice, it leaves us about choice.
Okay, well now my choices went down from, if I choose not to use system D,
my choice goes from 400 to 4.
Yeah.
The fun with that too is like airway moving away from 32 bit RC.
64, which kind of makes sense, but it's like you're just lost out on so many devices
that are still perfectly capable.
Well, we're actually recording on the 32 bit device right now.
I have a lot of 32 bit hardware that I can still press into service.
So I kind of went back to Slackware for now, hopefully.
There's, I don't think there's any plans to put system D in it,
but I'm fine with the VSD style on it.
I don't know what it says.
Do you system D and ask the 64?
I can't imagine just, you mean it's so repacketed, like a 32 bit.
But some labs have a 32 bit version.
I think Debbie still supports 32 bit for the time.
That's right there.
But I know like some of the Linux Mint has 32 bit still.
Which one was the...
But a lot of them will only support like the later 32 bit processing with PA use support.
Yeah.
Well, like I can see that too.
But some labs does have one that's non-PA internal logo you can get.
What was the debut and what this super-sported architecture was?
You could install it in like anything.
I don't know if they used to.
I don't know if they still do.
I know some of the VSDs are like that.
Like VSD is like that.
That's their whole good thing.
Yeah, it's like what I'm saying for like...
We install Linux on whatever.
You know, nobody's supposed to ask, should they?
But one was they could.
So it's like, it became a distribution where it's like you can install them like
PlayStation's Xboxes, cell phones.
I think like two VSDs and I think the least debut at one point
used to support a lot of older architectures aren't around any more stuff like
where it is going to help them and chip like that.
But the problem is we're getting to a point now
where even if you compile all the stuff to run on some of that old stuff
you're not going to get the software's not going to run on it.
You know what I mean?
Like even if I could get say whatever.
I might be able to install a software on a 486 with like a RAM
but what am I going to actually do about it?
Yeah.
Well, it's not a feature crew.
Like you get a project that grows and grows because people...
Hey, well this is cool.
But can we have this feature, this feature, this feature, this feature,
and until it's so bloated, it sucks much.
Like well, we're like...
I think you need to start to scratch something smaller
so this is where we're going to take it and get a third one that comes out
and then add another whatever.
But over time they just add so much to it that it just no longer runs.
Well, yeah.
And there's a couple of cases where it's like...
There's a package that has been like version lock
like the no longer supported
but it doesn't have any of them, you know, hardcore known security issues
like they'll still be like security patches for like...
Oh, you found a way to hack and do it.
Let's cover that hole, but they don't have features
and just stays there.
And then it becomes disinkeened
because all of this has been updated in like, you know, three years
so obviously it's junk and let's go with this other thing
but it's funny.
It still works though.
Yeah.
I have that issue right now with...
There's an emulator I really like called cake confusion
and I don't think it's been...
I don't think the code's actually been updated.
This is 2009, I think.
Yeah.
And I actually love that emulator because the way he wrote that was...
he was trying to really more emulate those CPUs than anything
so it's very accurate.
I mean, I'm sure it's not 100% perfect but...
and the way the way it's set up, you can...
with that one emulator, you can emulate
the Sega Master System, the Game Gear,
the Genesis Omega Grap, whatever you call it.
The 32X and Sega CD and it's all there in the package
and all you really need is, I guess, the Sega CD BIOS.
Yeah.
And that's awesome.
And I love it.
And it does a really good job.
It's got a high compatibility level.
You know, I'm not seeing anything.
I haven't run everything on it either,
but I haven't seen anything that has it run for me.
And I really dig it, but now one of the problems I've run into
is that it's starting to get code and it requires like...
one of the libraries that depends on has moved on
and like if you run it, even if you're running like a multi-arch system.
Yeah, it's like...
one of the libraries that needs a 64-bit.
And it's...
You just take me and it's like...
Or just like an arch Linux with a 64-bit only.
And, you know, that's what I've run for a long time.
And trying to run Steam on it,
because I don't want to play a lot of games anymore
if you don't play a lot of older games.
But like...
You know, every once in a while I'm down in Steam,
and it's just like...
they drop 32-bit support.
They don't do multi-living more.
So now it's a question of like,
how do you get Steam on it,
because it's like 32-bit only,
at the left side of the chat.
So, there's all this like encapsulation you had to do,
or like you had it wrongly.
Basically, it's a separate system with it, system,
and it came out of its head at that point.
You probably would better off just running a 32-bit
in a virtual machine or something.
Yeah.
And it's almost like...
You kind of want to embrace certain things.
Like, Steam is one of those things where they kind of...
start putting out games,
geared towards limits.
You kind of want to support that.
I mean, that's...
You would think that would be like a main selling point,
because a lot of people would be like,
hey, why aren't you running on a freedom sort of software?
It's like, oh, you know, like, like, games.
We have Steam, and, you know...
Yeah, it feels like I shoot yourself in the foot,
kind of, like...
Yeah, in a way.
I don't know.
I get, like, everybody likes it.
Shiny and fancy,
and my latest and greatest,
but, you know, traditionally,
Linux is all it's been.
We're a little behind the times,
and hardware support,
and that's okay.
You know, with this wait for support for Linux.
Yeah.
If you don't mind me, you know,
couple of your own solutions,
and that's fine.
But now it's getting to the point where it's like,
if you don't agree with certain ideologies,
you know, you're not a part of the community.
And so, I think this happened.
A lot of this happened out the point fingers,
but, like, around the time,
when Ubuntu hit the thing right around the time,
Vista came out,
and Vista was universally loud as crap,
and then a lot of people left,
and Ubuntu was this easy-to-use version of Linux,
and a lot of people came to Linux through Ubuntu that way,
but then they all started bitching about things, like...
Yeah.
I know that sounds bad,
but it's like, why can't this be easier?
And why can't it be like this and that?
And I don't know, I feel like,
that's why some distros are a little more bloated than others.
Like, it's totally catering basically.
Yeah.
Which I can see that is like,
not to be like ripping on a given such section of community,
but it seems like there's a certain point
when you grow out of Ubuntu.
Yeah.
Typically, I see people like,
hey, what Linux I'm trying,
they go Ubuntu,
they'll simply jump up to mid,
or they'll realize it's based on dead end,
like try that out.
You know, the gesture of Bob,
and they might settle back into it,
but if you've only been using dead end,
or Ubuntu,
or like mint,
there's a lot of other options out there,
and without really seeing everything else,
you kind of get to walk into the minds of the fact that all of it is,
and it basically becomes its own cathedral,
where it's just like, you know,
and then you have a mindset that is just like,
support some, you know, like,
system D,
and it's like,
no one's really saying,
can we also run this other thing instead of,
or, no, it's pretty much, you know,
support this across the board.
Two, that you've read into this weird thing too,
we're like,
a month system like Ubuntu,
where it's like all graphical,
and a lot of the people who come to those,
their mindset is,
the command line is a hindrance,
and we don't want to rely on it at all.
Graphical, graphical, graphical, graphical.
You've, you've,
excised the whole,
like,
you, that's a shoot yourself in the foot,
kind of move too,
without realizing it,
I'm not going to go into all that,
but,
it's like,
it creates the schism
where you've got people who are in the command line,
are comfortable with command line going.
You, you get these distros where, like,
things are like,
oh, really complex,
because we hate graphs,
because these people,
bitch about things being graph,
or all that,
and then, like,
so to see a lot,
it doesn't really seem like it grows organically,
either,
because it gets,
you know,
everybody who's involved with that gets pissed off,
because all these other people are bitching,
wanting everything to be graphical,
and then,
yeah, I don't know,
it's,
that seems like what happens,
so,
it causes problems across the board.
Well,
there's two definitions of
user friendly,
and they are diagnosed with problems.
There's user friendly,
like,
you sit down on a computer,
and it,
caters to you,
and that's user friendly,
and there's also
a user friendly,
since where I work with a computer every day.
Well,
let me do it,
the right way,
and that's from me.
Like,
I don't,
certainly like Windows,
because,
you know,
you try to use it,
it's like,
they're,
they're catering to people
that haven't spent their life in front of the screen,
and they kind of do things that's,
it's intuitive,
but it's not fish.
But for me,
it feels like I'm fighting with the operating system,
that makes you do what I want to do all the time.
Well,
in Linux,
like, I'll have a tour of,
like, when I move,
when I move my Linux box,
it is just,
right to the command board.
But it's,
it's for Apple,
you know, it's,
it's actually around,
like, a i3,
or actually,
right now,
but it looks like
it's booted into the command board,
because that's where I do everything.
Like, I don't need any,
any graphical components,
but like, if I do want to,
you know,
search the way outside of,
like, you know,
W3N,
or Linux or whatever,
you know,
load it,
like, you know,
Chrome or something.
But it's still command-line,
but it has the capabilities
to, like,
spawnback,
or windows.
And,
for somebody that's not used to that,
though,
this is,
look at it,
like,
move in your hand,
and click on something,
and you're just going to take more time.
Just type that look with it.
But you have to be a fast type,
or,
or you want keyboard,
you know,
shortcut keys.
But if you're not learning shortcut keys,
then it's like,
you're never going to get better.
And ideally,
the,
like,
the shortcut keys are
something you can edit.
Like,
you know,
when you're working with a window manager,
you can say,
you're on hotkeys,
or whatever you want to call them,
like,
windows,
you know,
alt tab,
it's always going to be alt tab.
Yeah.
And if you don't know,
like, alt tab switches windows,
it's like,
seriously learning,
you think you can use,
but, like,
I often do that in Linux,
like, you know, alt tab management synths,
but sometimes,
also,
sometimes,
and I have that option too.
Like, right now,
like, you know,
like, then,
I'm just going back through and reading
my main configuration,
because,
you know,
I kind of know
that there's better ways to do things,
and it's like,
if you want to do it that way,
and just, you know,
edit a text box,
and just,
everything works.
And sometimes,
you know,
the troubleshooting,
that's part of the process.
I think you learn,
like, what you're actually doing,
but it's like,
my background is,
I like to do this,
because I like to
see what they can do.
Like, what,
you know,
I don't know the limitations,
but let me,
find a way to glitch it out.
You know,
but,
once you've, like,
first of none of the barriers,
that you can't overcome,
then it's just like,
I don't,
I don't want that,
I don't want to be a grow.
You know,
if it's something I need to learn,
I sure don't need to watch,
some video,
a book,
I gotta read,
that's fine,
but don't flat out,
prevent me from doing,
computer-y.
I think,
I think a lot of this,
too, comes from,
a certain mentality of,
people have this
daily driver mentality,
where,
I need a computer that,
that just works every day,
to do these handful of things,
I need it to do,
because we live in a world now,
where a lot of people's,
day jobs,
and their work,
or whatever they're doing,
requires these specific
applications,
and when they don't work,
then they get in trouble,
it's not even their job,
or whatever.
But, you know,
that's really not the world,
computers grew,
you know,
they're not really
computer at that point,
it's an applaud,
they're not really computer,
at that point,
it's an appliance,
and that's,
yeah, that's what we're,
just like the internet appliance,
yeah, the,
the Urban 2000,
and,
it's okay,
the Windows computer,
on hand,
for, like,
job applications,
because a lot of times,
you know,
you gotta build the survey,
to make sure that you're
candidate,
and this job,
or just something,
or, you know,
instead of your WD information,
whatever,
links to the government website,
click it,
you can check the PDF,
and you gotta sign off on it,
and you're like,
you can get, like,
50% of the way through,
like,
pure Linux system,
you know,
it's a type of tricky thing,
or, no,
totally running Linux.
Yeah.
Or, like,
you have to, you know,
give us,
just some kind of,
like, some tricks to,
maybe if it's all, like,
mono,
or,
some kind of, like,
spotlight,
kind of,
kind of different things to get through,
just like,
trying to get that necklace
up and running on Linux,
is, you know,
difficult for a long time.
And, sort of,
really probably,
you're like,
okay, Linux,
put a signature on this,
and it just doesn't work,
and you're like,
I'm coming down,
trying to troubleshoot my way around this.
Let me just,
boot into Windows,
and just,
sign this piece of,
you know,
whatever,
and just send off,
and just, you know,
none of those steps,
strictly require Windows,
but it's like,
they force you to use Windows.
Yeah.
And, you know,
there's no,
there's nothing there that says
I should use one browser,
over another,
or what operance is,
over another.
I mean, you know,
HTML renders
as HTML do.
So, why do they even check
what operance is going to be running?
It just,
it limits so much.
But,
that's the way it is,
and then,
it's going to be running.
It's going to be running.
It's going to be running.
It's going to be running.
It's going to be running.
That's the way it is.
Yeah.
It's kind of weird too,
like,
it makes me sad,
like,
the only way around that,
I think,
is, it's part of the reason why, like,
cloud computing has grown so big,
is because,
it's easier to deal with it,
it's easier to manage,
and,
but I don't,
I don't know.
I,
I can't imagine enjoying
a computer
anymore when
all we have are Chromebooks,
like, you know,
I'm still going to
tinker with it,
but it's not the same.
It's like,
why do you have to
jailbreak advice
just to use it?
Yeah.
And,
it's like,
yeah,
sometimes people like,
you know,
even I see people in the jailbreak,
it's like,
you're working more,
which is,
people are not
enforcement,
but if you have,
if you have advice
that you pay for,
and they're not letting you
use it,
then you don't know it.
Yeah,
you really know it.
You don't know it.
And,
some,
there's people that say,
oh,
you only really lease it
from the company,
it's like,
I don't want it.
Yeah.
I want this other thing
that's not going to move in me,
because...
So, I'm paying my money
and it's my property
and I shouldn't be able
to be what I want.
As long as it's not like,
yeah,
hurting anybody else,
what the hell difference does it make?
Yeah.
Well, you know,
the hacking that I do is just trying to,
like,
push back the boundaries
of my own systems.
I'm not breaking into other
rims I'm not trying to push
the dirt boundaries.
I'm just trying to,
you know,
keep my little space
in jail.
And,
you know,
get off my lawn
and stuff.
Very nice.
So, yeah,
Blender can do...
video editing...
We have to bring that
in a full circle.
Yeah.
And,
Marvin's pretty cool.
He's a long one project.
The more we need that,
we'll put those in the show notes.
And,
the
yards revenge plays.
Yes.
Somebody needs to make
a
open...
Open your computer.
Yes.
It was like,
with a custom,
like,
a little letter.
You can put
the,
you can put the four-speed
on the top of the screen,
or the side.
Two days later,
you're fighting and
barring.
And,
like,
or,
one of the best
skyrim mods I ever saw
was they changed the
dragon to, like,
toss the tanker
toss the tanker.
Ah,
I mean,
yeah.
Shoot, shoot!
Just like that.
All right.
She probably
is the thing.
