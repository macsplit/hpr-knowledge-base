One useful feature here I think is that you can simultaneously monitor all of your email accounts
or you can decide that some do not need to be monitored.
I noticed that one email was actually a typo I must have made at one time
and another was a work email address from before I retired.
So I cut monitoring on those two.
Honestly, I don't know that I would pay for a premium account just to get this feature
but I like that I get it as part of the package.
I could do all of this by going to have I been poned and not spend money, but this is very convenient.
And then the final section alerts.
This is tied to the dark web monitoring. Right now it says I don't have any alerts.
But if one of my email addresses or user names was compromised I would get an alert
and a button to click to take me through the process of changing my password.
So the bottom line I am very happy to be a premium user of last past.
We have a family account for my wife and I and it works out well.
This update basically makes maintenance that we should be doing anyway more convenient to do.
And now if you'll excuse me I need to go clean up a few passwords.
So this is a hook up for Hacker Public Radio signing off and as always encourage you to support free software. Bye bye.
