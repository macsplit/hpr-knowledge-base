This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4369 for Thursday 1st of May 2025.
Today's show is entitled, What LP Records Do I Have?
It is hosted by Fred Black and is about 56 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag, the summary is, Fred counts up all their long playing vinyl records
by organization number.
You are listening to a show from the Reserve Q. We are airing it now because we had free
slots that were not filled.
This is a community project that needs listeners to contribute shows in order to survive.
Please consider recording a show for Hacker Public Radio.
Warning, warning.
This is an emergency show.
If you hear this, go to your nearest microphone and record a show.
It could be whatever, but remember, HPR needs you.
Because the backlog is running low, we need more shows.
So I collect vinyl records and I thought I could just count them all up, all 200.
My collection will probably have grown by the time this show has been released.
But it is just my first 200 LP vinyl records.
And how I am counting them up is bad name, the album name, the record label name, the
record number of it and then whatever notes I might have with it.
And now some records might have another number assigned to them.
These are three, I think it was four, maxi singles that I accidentally classified as LPs when
I gave the numbers.
But those will also be stated.
So now count the whole list of it.
Two, doesn't have a band name because it is a best off album, there are a lot of them in here.
So if you only hear a band name and then comes the record label, then this is all that is given.

That
Is
The Mall
And I might have
Made some mistakes
In the middle of it.
And also
This is
More or less the first time
That I
Am using
The International
Phenetic Alphabet
Sorry if I made some mistakes
Or almost said
A different thing
Since I thought
For example that
B
Would be beta
Not a bravo
But it seemed like
I was wrong
Anyways
That about wraps it up
Now again
If you hear this
Go to the nearest
Microphone
And do
Something
It could be anything
But just submit a
Show
HPR
I hope that this
Will not be
Submitted
Or will not be aired
Until
At least a year
