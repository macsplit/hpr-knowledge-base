Hello everybody my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio
Today Community News for June 2020
Joining me live live live from from from Scotland Scotland Scotland
It's Dave Morris
Hello everybody I think the live is a relative term but yes
Well live from me Dave, live from me
Yes, yes how's everything?
Everything is gone okay, ish.
It's a busy here in the backroom dusting
Oh, excellent
Child labour, it's terrible
Yeah, mine are a bit too old to get them to do that sort of stuff now
Be more likely to get me to do for them
So this is HPR, Hacker Public Radio is a community podcast network
Which is kind of probably needs a bit of explain and as to what that is
We are a family of shared so it's one single podcast but people contribute
Chills to that podcast and
And the people who contribute Chills are not
Are the people who listen to the episode so essentially anybody can contribute to this podcast that is Hacker Public Radio
So this is the community news show done by some of the genders around here
So the main thing we do is look back and
Show us for the last month so that if you missed something at least
Dave and I have come to donut people are welcome to join as well
We've switched it now to 1600 no to 1400 UTC
Which works out better for me
Yep, good good
So technically my 50 megabit fiber has gone down to half a megabit upload
And it is killing me, it's killing me at the minute
So there's an engineer coming out on Monday to have a look
So if this show is the older is a bit crappy, you probably know why
So we start off by introducing the new host, go ahead Dave
Well, there's going to be a deafening silence because I know you host this one sadly
How is that possible?
How is that possible though when you look at the numbers, the download numbers
And you look at the number of hosts that we've had in our entirety
There's only about 10% Dave, where are the other 90% the silent masses?
Have they nothing to speak? Have they no contributions to make to the network?
Why? Why do they do this to me every week Dave?
Every month we have the same thing
It's terrible, it's terrible
Do you feel guilty now?
Not you obviously
Do you listening to this who has contributed to the show?
Okay, any who, enough of this craziness, the most important thing in the water here
Because I'm acting a little bit funny
So let's have a look at what went on last month
The community news show we did, did we?
Or did I forget to turn up for that one as well?
No, no, no, that was definitely, since here Ken was on board this time
In my notes
Got a zaris together, figured out how to use a trap
But my connection went down and came back over again
So it's a good thing you were around otherwise it would have been even more embarrassing to me
So no comments on that show, so we didn't say anything controversial
Ha ha, be plenty of comments on this show
Lots of controversial stuff coming up later
Stay tuned
But first show of the month was the phonetic alphabet
Which is I put in the ham radio section
And there was one comment
That was from CRVS
Do you want to do that one Dave?
Yes CRVS says you forgot November
So in the end
I finally got the chorus of that one blood hand gang song for which is episode is relevant
Nice
I have no idea what he's talking about
I'm just finding out
Saw automotive
Anyway, the phonetic alphabet is a fun thing
Yes, yes
I used to have it written out and pinned on the wall beside my desk at work
I should do that again actually
It makes sure I've got one nearby because it's useful thing to have in your head
It's yeah, I use it all the time
It was one of the things on the
I worked in the health desk and was one of the things I you learned straight off
Because we had to have an international one because every country has got their own
Versions of us in the Dutch one they have like names
Zantippa
X
14 or so
S for Zantippa
S
Kind of weird one that they have
Well not weird one obviously it's perfectly normal if you're Dutch but it's not very phonetic
So the reason
You should record one
You should record one
As a reply
As a reply to cloud 2
It can actually be the
Different languages you know the Mandarin one and the yeah
Exactly
Yeah, yeah, Swahili one I'm looking forward to already
Cool
Actually if you're if you're a Dutch listener and you haven't contributed to the show
That's might be a good introduction one
So the following day we had what is now a series Dave
Matchbox cars and we pop that in under model hacking
Creating restoring painting all sorts of models from RPG characters to model cars
I like that and it was one of Tony Hughes's
AKA Tony H1212
Where did you ever tell us what that H1212 thing is?
I was just thinking I've never asked him
We should get the story at some point
Yeah, that will be a show about it
Tony would have no problem doing that
So I don't think there were any comments on that one
The following day we had for my entertainment
How I have my file server and media center put together
And this was by Arthur 72
Nice little episode at this one about using Slackware
Nice overall introduction to settling everything up
And I must admit I copied the sambar snippet myself as I was setting up something there
Nice notes
It was the thing that struck me
It was sort of notes that you can go back and dig into later on and understand
It was very good
Yeah, all those big fans of the old show notes here
Dave and I
Indeed
So again, no comments on that
So we will move on to a show that had two comments
And that was advanced in map tips
Locating computers on the enterprise network
Where operator put me to shame
Pop me to shame
With my episode 3052
Locating computers on the network
Do you want to do the first one?
Yeah, I'll do Beezy's reply comment
Thanks for reminding me he says good episode
Thanks for reminding me that I know nothing about networking
Well, it's you and me both, John
Yeah, it's amazing actually
There should be more networking tools here people
Don't assume that people know how to do this stuff
No, no
It's got so much more complicated than I used to be in charge of it
At one point when we were running X25
And X25 is relatively simple
But once you got into a packet rings and all these other weird things
And then ethernet I started to look at the plot
Yeah, but it's pretty much ethernet now
Is the everything goes to ethernet
Now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
By a nerd
Anyway, CM Hub says quality episode really enjoyed this one
Find myself nutting along an agreement
And finishing some of your sentence
Lots of good refreshes and some new tips in here for me
Thanks a ton for submitting this one
Mmm, Dave
Yep, yep, yep
Would that be a good point?
Is that let me just look into the ethernet there
Do I see CM Hub's raising his hand?
Submitting a few series
A few episodes in the series there?
Yeah, I think it might be
Completely
It could be
Oh, Lordy
Another one on the router thing
OpenBSD server building a new Wi-Fi router and server
From Zenfloder
This one I listened to while my daughter was in the dentist
Social distancing, etc
And
It was good that the show notes were here, you went through them as well
But yeah, I'm not really into
I've not really done a lot with BSD
But this was interesting to see the approach
Absolutely, absolutely
There were things here which rang vague bells from the days of
Cisco networking and firewalls and stuff
But yeah, different and intriguing
Yeah, most fascinating
Not at all complicated, but just
Now that you know how to
Easy once you know how to do a type thing
Yeah, but also very easy to mess up if you don't know what you're doing
You're just going by our experiences way back
Setting up the fancy firewall rules and stuff
And then the consultant and he said
He did it all wrong mate, he did it all wrong
He did it all wrong, he did it all wrong
Oh, okay then, right, fine
That's why it wasn't working then
Yeah, exactly
Norrist says, read on your voucher
The idea of running your home voucher offer
Read only file system is very interesting
To which Zen Flutter 1 replied
Read only routes
You can set up the GUITAR because that's for no
But I open BSD to actually lock all route access rights off
In this case, the file system is read into memory on boot
That file system is locked down for the duration
No one can make any changes to the system from that point forward
It could be run in QEMU and even locked down
What drives could be accessed with the DD command as well
This makes any kind of attack absolutely impossible
Wow, impressive
Interesting
Hello Dave
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm here, yeah
Sorry
So speaking, oh, no, that was interesting actually
They're all read only thing
Yeah, yeah, I've never come across such a thing
Yeah, you learn a lot, don't you?
On this HBR thing
You do indeed
Speaking of which, pens, pencils, paper and ink are two
Another one that we made, the art of writing an open series on writing tools, media supplies and techniques
In this show, Dave talks about pens, pencils, writing paper and ink
Actually, this was useful
This is one where you explained the clicking the review of some pens
Is this the one where you went through the type of paper or stuff?
Start the next one
Do you not care, I remember how
Good morning
I did mention paper, yeah, yeah
The feathering and that sort of stuff
I found that very useful to know
Yeah, yeah, it's a thing that you plan to trip over if you're into that sort of pen and stuff
So there's a lot of crappy paper out there
I didn't get any comments on this but I do get an email from Zoke who was saying something to the fact that
Oh, I don't know whether I should be sending in a show in this series, which I said
Send it, so I'm sure
Absolutely
Hopefully we will be hearing from Zoke at some point
So I hope you're listening
Good, like a show please
Been wild, somebody could do with Send it in the show
Indeed
This is Claudio Miranda's response to Linux in laws
A bit more history about the next step
Computer program and monochromic says a review of the review
Thanks for the valuable feedback Claudio will tackle that as part of a few episode
Future episode and true to his word he does
Following day, cyclop our lease hacker
Holy crud, I have a kinesis advantage to keyboard, wow, that looks weird
Yeah, and I mentioned this to my sons, you've ever heard of them
I don't know, I've got one
Oh, okay
I'm somewhat touched with the level of certificate
We're talking to you about that
That point of which he dozed off
Yeah
So yeah, but these are most impressive things
As he said, my son said, you can borrow it if you like, but having looked at this
I don't
It's a standard layout in the keys
Well Jack, or anything, but wait
Maybe we should describe it
But it's like as if you've got a plank erectangle
And somebody has taken two ice cream cubes, scoops
Out from the top, left and the top right
And then put half the keyboard keys in there on either side
And you just sit in that ice cream scoop thing
And at your thumbs there are more keys like delete and enter and backspace and stuff
Yep, yep, yep, it looks like I can touch types
So that's a problem
It would be a good thing to learn on actually
I did borrow keyboard from my son as a consequence of this show
And it's a gold touch keyboard which is one of these
sort of flatter type keyboards
But it's split into two
So you can get various orientations that suit the positions where your hands are
Because with both your hands together quite close together on the standard keyboard
You can end up with shoulder issues after if you're using it day in day out
And so these types of keyboards are quite good for wrist action, repetitive
straining, jeery, shoulder issues, etc.
But I'm crap, absolutely
You're too old to learn this new stuff
Let me give it a go
The thing about that tool to stuff is you say it in 20 years later you're still going
Fuck it
I should have said that
20 years ago
Yeah, yeah, I'm giving it a try
I'm giving it a try
Anywho, to what the do, say I'm obsessed
Seem obsessed says great keyboard
I've been using a kinesis advantage for years owner of two and I love them
They've helped with my RSI coin a lot
A couple of notes, the scape and function keys are membrane, I'm pretty sure
One can also program the keyboard to beep on all key presses
Which is useful to avoid bottoming out
I agree with you two weeks skill that acquisition time with keyboard
I find that many years later
I still want to use the advantage plus and equals and
And tilde locations on any other keyboard
Thanks for sharing this one
Cool
The following day
Ahuka comes along with a gimp series
An overview of the open source graphics program with a focus on
To graphic issues
And there are two comments on this one
The first one is Brian and Ohio
The gimp, Rachel
My wife and I are both avid bird watchers and this year I added taking pictures of them the birds
To the mix and I wanted to process some of these photos
And I often thought of the gimp
Looking forward to more tutorials
If they're half as good as the Libra offer set
They'll be awesome
Thanks for the show
That's great to recommend
Ahuka says, I'm glad it helped
I'm glad you liked it
I've had one more already uploaded in the queue
I've just finished writing a third one
So there is more to come
Yeah great stuff
As Brian says
If it's Ahuka and he's doing a series on something like this it's going to learn a lot of things
Absolutely
Because that Libra offer series is
Legendary now at this point
So the following day
CM Hubs tried something new
Which was a rambling walk on his
A rambling show while he was taking his
Mandatory lockdown walk I guess
About putting a new PC together
This is interesting because I basically just switched the pies now
And failing that
Chromebooks which I convert to
Link real Linux machines
Did he give and I that said I bought a second hand
Well it was a damaged
Machine which was new
So but it was around the same price as a Chromebook
250 bucks but it was a good machine
That said
Did you say how much this was going to be?
Can you give us a price
I don't recall him saying
And making notes on it
I met a conscious effort to listen
But I don't think he mentioned a price during this
It would be nice to
To know
It's quite an interesting configuration
So you think it cost a few pennies
Yeah I have no idea I could
Go figure out how much all of this would be but then again
It's never going to be the same price as a Raspberry Pi so
You know what I mean
No no it's just true
I did build a computer back in 2013
And since
It cost me a fair bit but I've been really happy with it
It's lasted a long time
I imagine this one is going to be the same
It's going to have a lot of life to it
Yeah so good for him
Mike Bremer says
A productive walk
It's been at least 15 years since I attempted to pick all
The parts and build my own PC
But after hearing your talk
I think I'll give it another try
Thanks for the inspiration
And CM Hobbs replies
Reproductive walk
Glad to hear it I was
It was not nearly as challenging as I had expected
Given the tools on PC part picker
The hardest part was actually finding things that could ship
And to swap parts on the build here and there via that site
Before I finally got everything together
Or for happy building
I hadn't seen the link
You didn't have a link to PC part picker in the show notes
I might have a browse at that to see what it's about
It's a bit like tweakers.net probably over here
Price comparison website
Anyway following day
Linux outlaws the big blue button
And this was a talk to Fred Tixen the product manager of big blue button
And there were two comments
One was by an anonymous listener
Free software licensing
Discussion about licenses
And contributionary agreements
Was interesting and informative
For example I really liked the way Fred explained how the LGPL works
In the context projects like the big blue button
And how it compares to the AGPL
Thanks for the show
And a hooker
Comments
I really enjoyed the interview
Good solid information about an open source project
Yeah good
Excellent
I think our
Linux use groups using big blue button
I've not actually used it
Myself yet
But I think that's what they decided on as a way of doing
You know virtual
Virtual meetings and stuff
So most intrigued to see what it's like
Yeah
Like to have a comparison of that
And jitsy and other video
Open a comparison of open video
Platform solutions
Why you would use one over the other
Yeah
So Tony Hughes's
Matchbox
Rich Storation Part 3
And these
These cars are in a bad state really
But as it goes along
You will see them develop
Which is kind of cool
And then
Yes
I love the pictures
Thanks Tony for the pictures
Because it really gives you a deep insight into
What's going on there
And some of the history of this sort of stuff
And just
How to put them together
I was always able to take them apart
But never had
I'm interested to see how he
Put them back together
So in Linux
In laws the review of the review
So this was
I think the one where they were talking about
Claudio's
Comments as well
To
And Claudio himself commented
All according to my plan
You really thought I wouldn't have done my research before
Recordings
I had already found out
About the new pricing scheme
And insight source
From the deep web
Way before my review
And given the changes
All the red tape usually involved
In such things I knew
It was worth putting that information out there
Human kind
And since your assumptions
Of my Linux lineage
Was an extra benefit
I'm not Italian
I can now leak this cable
From the
Telanz
De Correzioni
And here's a link
There, hack the plan
The truth is out there
I want to believe
Thanks for the recursive
Recursive review
My skin is pretty thick
Yep
I leave it to the listener
To go back and listen to the show
To find out what that's all about
I love the thought that
Is Italian
It's very typical
Italian accents
I'm still like
Why are they doing Italian accents
Well it's good
Okay, maybe they're trying to do
A Spanish accent
Or a Mexican accent
Or like me
There's one accent
Whatever happens to come out at that particular time
Oh I know
Yes
Me too
The podcast recommendation for your consideration
Is kind of what I'm thinking
Of calling these things
Makers corner from our own
Very good friends
Yannick et al
And
They had
John and Phil on
Along with Nate of course
To talk about the 32
BLIT
And
This was an interview
Really representative of the show
But the show is awesome
It contains anything that you're interested
In electronics
And a little bit of hardware hacking
The interface of people
And hackers and machines
Then this is a podcast
For you really really cool
Good stuff
Yes indeed
Yes I've not actually
Had not actually heard this show yet
Because I always run with a huge battle
Of podcasts
So it was great
It was a great show
And the two people
Are only guys
Are very impressive
And the interview was really well done
I thought
They had the Northern stuff
Do you want to do
They ride on the hills
Yes Brian and Ohio says
A book recommendation
This guy said
He has friends that need coffee
Do you know
Sounds like a dodgy character to me
Well yeah
Never heard of him
Yeah
But yeah
The
Lua business is interesting
Is it something you've got into yourself
Not just yet
No
It's only a matter of time
Eventually
There will be a 3D printer in this room
Eventually
It really is
Well actually
Turning away in the background
And seeing computers
Actually I would really prefer
A small
CNC milling machine
And a CNC lat
Always wanted one of those
Yes
There are some people who
Is there not a 3D printer
Also do some fairly
Wait CNC work as well
I think there is
But I've seen people hack them
In terms of CNCs as well
Which would be interesting
Anywho
Andrew Gunway
Did a surprisingly good show on metrics
And I know
That he is trying to tempt us
To the dark side of my
Teaching mats here on
HPR
But we will not be conned
No no we will not
Yes
This was
Yeah go on sorry
This was a good show
Actually
I really wish my mats teachers
Were as interesting as
As Andrew
Was
Back in the day
There were not
Agreed agreed
I thought it was great
I really enjoyed this
I listened to a role
I was doing some domestic
Thing and
Made a note
Go back and listen again
And think about what he is talking about
Because it was
A little bit hard to digest if you are not
Really very mathematically inclined
But I tried to use polar coordinates
At one point during my
Research is a very handy way of
Doing stuff when you
You know you were trying to work out
Parts that things
Take etc
And yeah so it was it was a very welcome
Very welcome show I thought
That there is apparently
A typo in it which Andrew mentioned
But I haven't heard
What needs fixing but I will hard deal
With it to make sense
That's the handle I was trying to think of
No no
No good show I hope there is more of them
To be honest
Indeed
Indeed
Yes, infatestimals
I thought that sounds like a hack round
To get round to shoehorn the maths in
Quantities which are very very very small
But not zero
That sounds suspiciously like it laws
In a
Web
Terms and conditions
Yeah
Yeah
But then it's I've been listening to astronomy
Podcasts just recently
Guy talking about the
Large Hadron Collider
And they tended to talk in the same way
See is astronomy as I put it down to
They have a different way of dealing with the world
Anyway
So shall I do Clintons
Yeah please please I'm looking forward to
Here
Looking forward to further episodes
Says Clinton Roy
Thanks for this episode
It's a nice gentle introduction to the topic
I definitely look forward to future episodes
Yeah, we had Charles and in
J had some
Had a series there on practical math
I wonder is this one that we should add to that
Anyway, Daniel Nohio says
More episodes
Keep going with this great topic
Couldn't agree more
Who also said excellent
I'm looking forward to more shows from this person
No, we're
I deliberately skipped over you don't know
The the background rivalry between me
And who
I believe every word you tell you
Yeah
God have been aware of
Move to the
Annie who
As long as I'm staying here recording the HPR show
I don't need to get involved in the family cleaning of the house that's going on
Keep talking
So the next show
Is
RFC 5 0 0
Flypark
Webcomics readers
And where they continued a discussion about
The RFC for atom feeds and stuff
Again, still have not convinced me that
Is
Is better
I'm not really able to make a judgment
Because I'm not
Looked at all the ins and outs of this
But it was
A fascinating subject
And an interesting discussion
I love their enthusiasm about this
This is great
But yeah, I must go and
I think I said before
Dig into RFC 5 0 0 5 myself
But just to see
What's going on
Yeah, it depends on whether
I adjust the way HPR produces shows in order to accommodate that
But the fact that you can't add an archive feed
Am I correct or not
In saying
That's right
Can you
Go, I'm sorry
Yeah, so like if we have
Right now we have 10 shows in
So two weeks in the main feed
And then everything else is the archive feed
So that means that every day the archive feed gets updated
As the new show comes into the main feed
The archive feed gets updated
So if you can't do that
What is the point
Yeah, yeah, that was a point
They did raise in the first show that
The archive is regarded to be immutable
Once it's
Actually useful, if there was
If there was
And like archive functionality
That didn't do that, that would be useful
Or a complete feed
Yeah, warning about browsers extensions
And add-ons quick show I did
To when
Realize that there was a
Unservery stuff started happening to my browser
And there was a note of date extension
Not maintained
Band by Google
Not updated in the chromium or browser
Which was a bit of a shock
Yeah, yeah, very nasty
Yeah
So the next one was
Tin's
Tincture
Tincture
It's an odd word
It's not one that usually
Come across but yes
Tincture
Again 50-150 on this show
It was nice, nice hearing
Yeah, it was
Yes, it was good to hear from
Yeah, audiobook club
Keep them coming
Apparently they're still doing the shows
Then never stop doing the shows
But they just
Have one that they thought was busted
And turned out not to be
Following date
Was there any comments on that?
Dave, don't think so. No
Dave, do I
I really enjoy these shows
I have to say
They're quite long
But I look at them as
They're coming up and they're
Two hours
And then two hours have gone by
And I was really
But the chitchat that goes on
And the all the banter
Is so you know, it just sort of
Carries you along, it's great
I really do enjoy them
Just thought they were to know this
Yeah, exactly, this is why
The weird part about it
Is those four guys
You know, if we were standing at a zebra crossing
Trying to cross the road
You wouldn't recognize each other
And yet at the same time
I feel such a bond with those guys
That it's like as if
You're out in the back garden
And you're just passing them a cup of tea
Or a beer or something
And they're just part of the family
That is HPR, it's absolutely awesome
Yes, absolutely
And yeah, great
Keep them coming
Ahuka
With a kasou
Kaka dev help me, please
Why, how do you work, Dave?
You know I'm never going to be able to pronounce this
And yes, you just sit there going
Oh yes, let's see how you can butcher this one
It's so fascinating to know how you're going to
No, I think it's Japanese
Is it a kasou or something like that
I don't know
That's how I'd say it
I'd want it to be Japanese if it's not
And this was a small sort of
What do you call them?
GoPro type cheap version camera
Yeah, yeah
Plenty of links in there
Links to his main article
And action cameras
Are becoming so popular in corporate waterproof
And this is one where
There was enough information in the show notes
So that
I didn't feel necessary to pull it over
From his
From his website
It's kind of
This goes back to the discussion we've had before
About when should your notes
When should you put your notes in or not
And at the time of discussing that
This show was going into the queue
And this is one of the ones
Where I didn't bring it in
Like which felt right
Even though
For some of them I do bring them in
Yes, yes I think some of them need
Some written material
To go with the talk
This one
Really is fun
Is I think you're quite right
It's kind of more because if
Of this one if you
It's likely that if you're interested
In this particular camera you would
It's a physical thing that will be available in this
Block of time
And therefore it's reasonable to expect
That his website
YouTube will still be around
For the block of time that that's available
There you go that's my logic
Don't know it's a good feeling
Probably not hard enough to explain that though
Following the Linux in-laws
Postgres oh yes
Very nice one
A little bit of a win here for us
Getting this this episode
Via the Linux in-laws guys
I found this one
Interesting topic
Yes, well I'm I'll be very keen on
Postgres for a long long time
I did some
As you know and I probably told you
At some stage you know just
Just a fast conversation
Yeah, he's a stupid
He's a pretty awful horrible
My skin yeah, yeah no no
Bridget is no Bridget is
Bruce Mondion is the way he pronounces name
I think is is fascinating
I've never heard of him
And I heard of him
I know he's a big big cheese
As far as postgres is concerned
But I've never heard him talk before
And he's most interesting guy to listen to
And into what so I was very good
I felt
There's a comment coming up saying that
Martin's sound level is really really low
And he doesn't have a good way
Well this is me saying it now
He doesn't project very well
I think Martin you should get closer to the microphone
And also speak more clearly
Because she got some very interesting things to say
So say them a bit more clearly please
But other than that
It's got very very cool
Yep
So the comment was which I just sort of spoke to
Bob says
Levels couldn't hear Martin at all
Just a low number
So yeah, 10 to 3
Okay, yeah it was
I was listening to this on the bike
And I couldn't hear Martin
So I switched to the next podcast
And then listen to it later
Oh my god
But it's hard to get to audio levels right
Oh I'm not criticizing it
I'm not criticizing it
But it's just something that probably
Sounds very much like it Dave
Well not from the point of view
I'm not going to criticize
But look at me in a state of perfection
And you should meet my levels
It's more
Yeah, we've all been there
But next time
Next time to see if you can do better
Thank you very much
So the next day generating comfortable passwords
This is an interesting one by CRBS
Using a Python program
On his Devorek keyboard
To create a comfortable password
That would kind of alternate left hand and right hand
Which in itself makes password
Kind of predictable but
Not by the time he's finished
To be true
Yeah, fascinating
Yeah
And also quite impressed
That the power
That Python had
In this
Yeah, yeah, I have to say
I didn't fully understand
What he was doing with
These Markov chain business
I'd love to hear
What
How you did that
You've started to tutor at all
Has gone nuts there listening to this
It's the sort of
Probability of
A given key
Following a specific key
So the key and then the probability of
Hitting some other one there after
Which is to do with presumably
With the sort of typing one does on a keyboard
I've tried to do this
I was looking up something i wrote
In about 1980
Something or other to do
With a similar sort of but nowhere near
Is clever
Similar sort of idea in mind
Trying to find
Freakancies of characters in
Common words and stuff
And creating the password
Based on that idea
But mine
I was constrained by having eight character passwords
Because machines in those days tend to say
Now password eight characters
That's it less if you want
Eight is all you get
So
But yeah
This is very clever
But as I said i'd like to know
Understand the Markov business a bit better
More shows
I actually plugged in an ordinary keyboard
To his table and tried it
With
To make passwords that i could type
And i actually can't use
For an interesting interesting thing
You know it's going ping pong
Across the keyboard in interesting ways
Okay
As you do
Yep, sigfolk commented
Saying thanks thanks for this one
Exclamation mark or more like
Thanks for this one
High praise indeed
Indeed indeed yes
And
Still we had the food
We turn
I think we've just run out with month
That was the
Daily
That was the last one last one
Can't jump forward
No no no no
Time wouldn't allow it
Time you want me stuff
No
Mist comments from last months
On Dave Morris's
Mumbling while on lockdown
Mist wrecks said
Should i
Yep
Hi Dan yes you're correct
It was indeed the taffy farm
This was
Dan Nixon saying
Was the thing you were talking about
Where you played
Back a tape thingy with grooves in it
And this is a
Your show
This was a thing that Mr.
Xamai did together
Which is chatting
There's one of these devices in the
Museum of communication across the
Four in
Five
But not from here so
Yeah taffy farm
Can't remember what it was called at the time
I never heard of it but
Anyway it certainly is a very strange
Devices Mr. X the one they had at the museum
Communication wasn't in working
Edition at the time
They were in the process of trying to repair it
Exceeded i must thank you for bringing this up
I really enjoyed rewatching
The youtube video link that gave
Which gives an excellent introduction
The device the sound quality
Seems surprisingly good i watched
The video while sitting at the center of my
Back garden all the best Mr. X
Yeah it was good
I looked at the video
Fantastic
The quality and the length of some of these things
It's quite quite amazing
And you can skip around between the
Tracks and an amazing piece of
Technology
So we do the comments from past
Shills
So
Shall i just explain
Please
Operator and 3056
Operator had
Not sent in all the notes he
Went to so he sent
The mist bits in as a comment
Which i intercepted
And actually glued into the notes
So i left the comment standing
And put a message in the notes to say
That the comment had been
Absorbed into the notes
And we're just going to mention this
Bit later on in the other business
I can do it now if you want to
Or it's just really to say
If you have corrections
It's far easier
You've emitted something
You've made a mistake whatever
And you want it to be fixed
It's far far easier for us to
Just go and change the notes on your behalf
Than it is for you to send in a comment
Mentioning the changes
And part of that is because
The comment mechanism can strip things out
That to
That might mess up what you're going to do
It'll take out backslashes for example
And that's one point
Another point is that
The comments don't get copied across to
The archive.org
So if people tend to go and read your notes
On archive.org they won't see the changes
Unless they're in the notes
Because if i make a change to the notes
I propagate them through to
Into the archive
So yeah it's generally a better
Better approach to
Contact an archive.org
And let us know what needs change
And we'll do it
We'll do it
We'll do it regularly as well
By we I mean you
Yeah
When we get these requests we do
I've written scripts that let me do it
It's easy as you might have explained it
So yeah it's not a big deal
A few comments on that
Three actually number one is
We deliberately strip out stuff
From the common fields because back in the day
When i took over
Helping out here at HPR
There were
We were being absolutely killed with comments
And even today we
Get occasionally people who try
Try to
Mess with the common system
There's about one or two attempts
Every second
To get into HPR
And that's even with all the stuff
That Josh has in place
So yeah that's thing number one
Thing number two is
That's we do
Want to move to
A way where people can submit their shows
As a diff
And update their shows themselves
But that's
That's on the long finger
Unfortunately due to me
The third thing was very important
But i can't remember what it was
Dev
Don't do that
I'm not sure
Just having trouble remembering my points
Oh yes about internet archive
If you're thinking that
We just have our shows on
That we just do the hosting on internet archive
We don't
We have actually
We Dave has managed to get
The shows over there looking absolutely fantastic
And as a result
They're
Using a lot of indexing that has been
Provided by
Archive.org and as a result of
Archive.org being such a big website
If you're
Searching for HPR episode
You're far more likely to get
Redirected to the archive.org website
As opposed to the HPR website itself
Which is no big deal because that's
From our point of view
It doesn't really matter
It's all about the content where it's hosted
It's not really that important
So
It's important that we keep them
Just so you do realize
You're far more likely
That people are going to find your show
The archive.org than the HPR
Yeah
Good
Okay, Klackke had a show
The joy of pip tools
And PiM virtual environments
And
Klackke replied
I've been using PiM virtual
Environment for a month now
And I'm reminded every day
Of how happy I am
Never to run into another pip
And by run or pip
And by shell again
So that's good
Next comment is
To
Inwards episode
Series one episode six
Pawn and Trump
And it's from Frank who says
Sorry to say but I found a sketch
Not on your tool
Because I'm a Trump supporter far from it
But it's just not funny in a comical sense
It gave me a sense of
I'm not sure it's a friend
Charmin
Not sure what that means
And I had to skip over it
After listening to the first
Minute or so
These also work on your audio balancing
First there was a low volume talk
Then suddenly a much louder
Before the sketch
Yeah I think that
That was already mentioned
In a comment earlier
About the audio levels
Friend
Is like friend shaming
So it's
To feel ashamed
About something somebody else has done
To be embarrassed because
Someone else has embarrassed themselves
And doesn't know it
So it's been
Not shaming your friend
But being shamed
By your friend
Not by your friend
Being shamed for your friend I guess
Yeah yeah yeah
Feeling embarrassed too
Sounds good for
Cringe
RFC part one
But clacky
Fluffy mentioned
Atom Tombstones
Element and gives a link
To the RFC
That was clacky
Commentating himself
And David
Windigo commented on yours
Do you want to comment?
No I'll do his
And then you can do yours in your own voice
Dave I hope you'll be
Excited to hear that the Shiva plug
Is still very well-sported in Debian
I had one up and running
With the latest version until very recently
Here's the resource I use
To set up mine link
Included
I have a hard time justifying
Keeping mine running
Lot with the raspberry pyre
And others being so much more
Full featured and powerful
But it's definitely an interesting
Piece of harder
To which you were bad?
I said hi windigo thanks to the link
I'd love to get my old Shiva plug up
And running again
Don't actually have a link
Use for it at the moment
It had a USB disk on it
And I used to use it as a
Git repo
Package called Gitosis
I think and I could access it
Went away from home
Then it was a playground for learning
About bind then the disk crashed
Anyway this is now my to do this
Thank you
So yeah I think
Point about
Raspberry pyre 4
With all that ram
Is a good one
But it seems such a shame
Because it's a beautifully crafted
Device and it sat
And sat
Behind the sofa
Planted the wall
The many years
Doing and stuff
Maybe that was why the disk crashed
So the cat was jumping on it
But it
What to use it for something
But it would be nice
To give it a try
But I'm not sure what to use it for
To be honest
Strange I had one
And it kind of broke
Within a few months
Alright
Mine actually broke
But I sent it back and got it repaired
Yeah I don't remember what was wrong with it
Actually now
But yeah suddenly
Not sure
The price of fly was external
I don't know, I don't know what it was
But yeah
It was mine
My main
Raspberry Pi precursor
And it was an important machine
I had a little consultancy business
At the time I used to go to my clients
And pull down
Stop off my
Get repo when I was there
Since they were
It's
Yeah it was
I think I have around at the time
More nostalgia than anything else
Now I guess
The wedding's tonight event
Has a few slots
Have become available
So if anybody wants to join
The D&D
Thing on wedding's
Denights
By the sounds of how much my son is laughing
During it
It is
Wedden's Day at 1700
UTC that's 1700
UTC
So on wedding's day nights
Which is
Something like
I don't know three o'clock in the morning
A tattoo time
So yeah I don't know
I told him
Apparently
He's running lots of games
But if you're
I know some people
Were asking
Were there any other three slots available
So if there are please get in touch
With a tattoo
Or ourselves here
Admin at hpacapublicradio.org
And we'll pass you on the details
Actually on the same hbr server
So you just turn up
Okay and I think you'll let
Your connections dropping out
I think you've had a few
few dropouts
I think we heard most of what you said
But there is
Having a few bandwidth issues perhaps
Yeah
This is very sad and depressing
But okay
Many take away
There is still another opportunity to join the D&D thing
UTC Wedden's Day
7 o'clock
1700
Did you get that?
That was good
And there's not a lot of point going through the events calendar
Because they're all going to be online
So have a look yourself
See what you can
Want to join
And other feedback
Oh I remember this
This is a wildlife
Okay, our feedback from the show notes
So most shows
We require
We process require us to make some level of
Modification to get them posters
This ranges from fixing tags
To complete rewrites of the show notes
Or verifying whether the intros were added or not
Each modification
That we make means that more
Human intervention
And prevents us from being able to completely automate
The upload process
In addition, there is a non-travel
A amount of time needed to fix these issues
And this can range from few minutes to an hour per show
And with 260 shows per year, this mounts up
So we don't normally contact hosts
When these issues come up
As it's usually quicker to fix them
Our souls
Rather than composing emails
I'm waiting for a reply that may never come
For the most part, our experience has been
That hosts are willing to fix these issues
If they become aware of them
As part of the ongoing steps towards
Automization
Would hosts be open to the idea
Of getting a processing report
Once they have posted their shows
This would list all the issues
The test tools found
And the steps that we needed
To
To rectify them
And actually then
Making changes to shows after upload
Sometimes errors occur
And then we have to do the same thing again
So
Essentially what I would like to know
Is from hosts
Would you like to get feedback
If your show needed to be
Modified in any way or not
And it's to be honest
Usually not new hosts that cause
These issues
We have older hosts
Things have moved on in their way
We process shows
And that sort of thing
Would you like
Is that something that would be useful
To you or would you hate us
If we start to do that
Can't do that
Can't do it
Okay
You should probably put that on the mailing list
I think that might be
No tip, notice it probably
So they heard it here first
Anyway
And then I'll also add it to the mailing list
So we get it again next month
And
Contributors for sending in
Updates to the past shows
Has been Windigo
Tell us all about that data
Yes, Windigo very kindly sent
In a batch of 10 updates
Which is inclined to do from time to time
Which we thank him enormously
And they have been added
So we gradually wickling away the
Number left to do
Hello, are you keeping track of this over time
536 shows
We
There are 536 that need work
Yes indeed
I don't usually make reference to this
In the notes
Usually cause it takes me time to go and find the page
Is it?
It's right there in the first page
I know
This though is featuring heavily in my
Yet to be documented plans for
For HPR
I use this quite a lot now
This page
If you want to find
Backed like
Fost damage view or
Corbute and flash
Corbute for instance
I wanted to do something on
Check one of the Chromebooks
And I went through this from the three shows
That they were in and copied and pasted of what I needed
So it's very useful
Yep
We did talk at one point about turning the
The alphabetical index
Or the tag summary thing
To at the end of this
This page into
Something more permanent
As a
As part of HPR in general
Rather than just being part of the
But please fix the tag issue thing
So yeah, I know it will be
It is just the outer of time
Yep
Okay
And you can already see these
Tags appearing on the
If you go to the homepage
And go to
Get yours
Full episode guide
Then you've got the tags there as well
And what I want to do is have
Each of those tags
So that's something that
In the plan
Yep
Or is there anything else
I think that's it
To go and start cleaning the toilet screen
Your timings were only
Should have done the dustings
Exactly
Yeah, exactly
Dusting done toilet search
Anyway, yes, there we go
Great
