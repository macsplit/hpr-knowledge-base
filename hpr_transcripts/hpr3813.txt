This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3813 for Wednesday, the 15th of March 2023.
Today's show is entitled, The Post Market OS Podcast.
It is part of the series podcast recommendations.
It is hosted by Ken Fallon and is about 32 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is, Ken welcomes a new podcast to the free culture podcast family.
Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public
Radio.
Today, another one in our podcast recommendation series and it is Post Market OS Podcast,
which is the podcast for the Post Market OS project.
And from their website postmarketOS.org, we are sick of not receiving updates shortly
after buying new phones, sick of the world gardens deeply integrated into Android and iOS.
And that's why we are developing a sustainable privacy and security focused free software
and mobile operating system that is modeled after a traditional Linux distribution with
privilege separation in mind.
Let's keep our devices useful and safe until they're physically break.
I'm all on board with that and the good news is they've recently joined the free culture
podcast network and as such this is a sample episode to promote their show, sit back, relax
and enjoy.
Hi.
I need to steal your microphone so otherwise you are being live streamed.
Nice.
Hello Internet.
Hello Internet.
Hello Internet.
Live.
Live.
We are live.
Oh.
Live from Bosdom.
We won't be live though because this is a recording.
Yeah.
Close enough.
Close enough.
Yeah, close enough.
Sorry.
All right.
20th, 20th, 20th.
Yeah.
Is there a period of?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll say live from Bosdom because...
Yeah I'll say live from Bosdom.
What episode will be it?
I'll say live from Bosdom.
28th.
28th.
Okay.
Live from Bosdom.
It's the post market OS podcast.
Woo!
This is Clayton also known as Crafty Guy.
Hello, I am Bartane.
Hello, I'm Peter.
And I'm Bart.
I'm Caleb. I'm Oliver. And I'm Luca. So many people. Yes, we are live together. Sitting together.
Yeah, where are we? We are currently outside of a cafeteria I think. All huddled together outside.
Yeah, yeah, tiny desk, tiny desk podcast. We really need to add a picture of this to the
podcast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think this is this is like the first time most are all the core
team has been together in person, right? Yeah. Yeah, not all of us, but look. I mean, I was there
previously, so I mean, yeah, I mean, this time also not everybody's here. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but it's close. Yeah. Yeah. So we are having a ton of fun here. We saw a lot of talks. So today is
Saturday. There was the deaf room, which was amazing. And yeah, just like every talk I saw was great.
I missed like two or so. How did your talk go? Yeah, my my talk about on dev two went well,
I think. So yeah, people seemed interested and I think for a lot of people was the first
I'm worried about it, right? Because they know are probably a installer. But yeah, what was your favorite
moment part? Well, I haven't been to the talk. So yeah, I probably know that in general. Well,
just all day, I don't have a specific moment to talk to on the sense of people. Lots of interesting
conversations. Everybody was excited. Yeah, it was good. Lots of people that were really new post
marketers and Linus Mama general, but also people that didn't know at all. And then I had to explain
the basics, which was art, but yeah, it worked. Yeah, pretty good.
Hopefully, but you were in the booth or the stand all day. Yeah, I have sore legs now.
So yeah, it's good to sit down. First time to sit down. How many hours?
Well, since tomorrow, this morning, like nine o'clock, so yeah.
All right, 45 actually. Yeah, quite a few hours. So we have a lot of new recruits now.
Definitely. Yeah, why also? We'll see. Like I was really impressed. There was one kid 14
year old and said you put it the banana phone, actually. And yeah, well, banana phone. It's the
Nokia 8110 for G. Yes, actually. Yeah, that's good to know. Don't that you know the name.
It comes in black and yellow and yellow one is the banana phone. Okay. And the black one is the
one that's in the matrix. Nice. Oh, I guess the older model. I was wondering how old he was.
14. Really? Yeah, I asked. Wow. That's really awesome. That's cool. Yeah. And it runs
the main line. And it's so amazing. Wow. And even Fosh is running. So I mean, you can use it.
Sort of. I mean, sort of. Sort of. It is running. You can look at the screen somewhat.
You can never get a run. You can even launch apps. But then then that crashes. Yeah. I mean,
it's already cool. Yeah. Amazing. I will file it as a book in Fosh and not in the, I mean,
that's the device. Yes. There's no touch screen on that, right? No, it is. Yeah. Yeah. So I wonder
what actually SXMO would do with like all the inputs. That'd be good. Yeah. That might work.
Pretty well. Yeah. I mean, interesting config, at least. It's normally SXO is like what,
free buttons. And now it is like 14. Yeah. That'd be cool. Does it actually have volume keys?
I think it does. And it has Enter and Backspace to function keys. So you get a few bonus
buttons. Also, the full a keypad, of course. And the dedicated button to pick up chords.
Yes. That's useful. Yeah. That's probably one of the most popular devices on the table.
Yeah. Because it's just so like being yellow. Yeah. You can't miss it. Yeah. It's amazing.
At one point, Lima developer came to the table and asked about pinefones and like they don't
receive that money box and how that comes to be. And yeah, we figured it's kind of mostly working.
And I also there are some bucks upstream and mesa. But yeah, it seems to to be working pretty
well overall. And I asked if what's there left to do. And if he thinks, yeah, basically he said
performance might be possible to improve the performance, but they would need proper
box report for that. So if somebody is interested in improving the performance of Lima, then
you can run a profiler and see where the bottlenecks are in your apps, in your environments,
and then file a buck report. That's basically what he said. So it was really a nice conversation.
And Lima is the pinefone GPU driver? Yeah. Yeah. For the Mali GPU. Oh, Mali GPU.
Oh, I'm sweating the context. Yeah. No, I wasn't sure. Cool.
Yeah, notes. Yeah, we don't have any notes on the, we're free.
Yeah, Ollie's prepared, but I think the exhaustive. I can't.
So I thought it was cool how many people were interested in the stand. It seemed like every time
I walked by, it was packed. Yeah, it wasn't a good spot as well. We were supposed to be in a
different building, but we got switched on and away, but we got switched to probably a better place.
Because it was right next to the entrance of the room, like after the floor. Yeah,
come up the stairs, like it's the first thing on the left side. Yeah, so it's next to KD,
which is nice. If you want to see like the other 16 or so stands, you had to go next to
else. So that's, yeah, it was pretty good. And also when the talk was over, like upstairs,
they would all go down, writes, come to us. Just amazing. Yeah, that's the point where you
cannot hear what anyone is saying anymore. No, it wasn't that bad. Wow, wow. It wasn't too great either,
no. Yeah. But also for the, well, I haven't been in the talks, but I heard it was also packed.
Yeah, the room was, right? Yeah, room was pretty full for most of the ones I attended, I think. Yeah,
like when the Fairphone talk started. Oh, yeah, that got packed. Yeah, Lucas talked, it was like,
it was great. Everybody thought he was trying to get in that room.
Well, it's cool. It's a cool shop, yaks. Like holy shit. Mainline, it's always good on the Fairphone.
And Sebastian from my emo did a great, like, MC the whole thing and did a great job there. Yeah,
like really finding positions between the talks. Yeah, it's interesting. We're pretty good. Yeah,
it was nice. He put some data into that. So I have one more story on my notes.
Two guys came by and one said that they, he has, he's using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or something
and runs it as tail scale tunnel, something like this. And he was like, oh, it's amazing that he can
put the phone to use and also started a patch to be in bootstrap to give something back. So
this was also very cool. And that's on the downstream kernel, right? I'm not sure actually what
need to look at the device. Pretty cool. Actually, use case. Yeah, that's not just regular phone
usage. Yeah, yeah, it's cool. Like a Raspberry Pi or something. Yeah, especially. Yeah.
One of the favorite people that talks I had at the stand with that somebody found out that
Firefox OS still is alive through KOS. Yes, there's also this open source one, right?
It's being continued. Kapaloon. Kapaloon. Peter, what were your favorite moments?
By the way, I think to add some conduct speeders from LinMob. Yeah, right.
I was lucky. It's called LinMob.net and I've got an app list which I'm a bad maintainer of, sorry,
the next phone apps.org. And I was on this podcast before. So, yeah, but I'm here at FOS
them and I attended all the talks of the FOS on mobile track and they all were great. And
my highlight was the non-Linux talk actually about G-Node. Ah, the one I missed. Oh, I wanted to see
it. It's so different, uh, micro kernel and they've got a visual interface so that where you can
see what an app or software that's running is connected to. So if you don't want your, I don't know,
an app to touch the file system, you can basically graphically make it so that it doesn't have
access to the file system. Well, cool. Yeah. And a pretty cool interface and it's really tiny also.
So if you want to try that, it's just a download that's maybe less than this episode of the podcast.
It's really like 20 megabytes or something. Yeah. Wow. But it's all custom. So you won't get your
normal stuff, right? Easily. But they, they ported, uh, Morph browser from UB ports.
Wow. You want to touch over to, um, G-Node and that ran. Okay. So you can actually run basic
chromium on this. Yeah. Wow. That's impressive. That's impressive. And so is it their own kernel from scratch
or? Yeah, it's some micro kernel thing framework. I don't know. They've been at this for years
from what I've heard. And it's a small company, uh, actually in Dresden, Germany. No. Yeah.
So it seems to be business. If I understood it correctly. And yeah, it's one of those
cool niche projects that really do something different, have a different take. Like,
no, we don't want those large, uh, change sets that you have from kernel.
It's to kernel release that you can't really review on your own, right? Nobody can do that.
24. So they're looking at new to looking at monitors, so interestingly in file systems, right?
Or I don't know, some sub-system that's not relevant to phones. Interesting. Maybe.
Uh, yeah. But, but it's really amazing, uh, to see this totally different thing working on
hardware that I'm quite familiar with, with a pine phone. Uh, and that was really cool, but
The rest of the Rocks was also quite cool, no bad talk, that's good, that's what we went for, and Lindmob Stickers, which is fantastic.
Yes, I need to get one, I didn't get one yet.
Oh, no, can't be done. Someone was looking for you at the booth, but you weren't there, so, hopefully he comes back somewhere, and then you're there.
That'd be good.
How was your talk, Clayson?
I don't know, you tell me. I haven't been there, so you tell me. Or somebody else, maybe.
As like a title, it was like, how do we go from here? Where do we go from here?
From Washington, right? The vent.
Yeah, I'd like to get home, and like, we're the beers.
No, it was an attempt to get people within the community to think about how to become organized and not waste as much time solving the same problems
that other people have solved in other distributions.
Yeah, I don't know, it's just a way to try to move things a little forward.
I guess also maybe in the direction of getting new features that nobody has working with, so I guess also voiceover, it might be a topic there,
it's like anybody that knows anything about it, say, hey, hey, this is maybe how cool it comes out, this is maybe the things you need to do,
and maybe links to some existing resources, some might find useful.
And also, of course, like cameras and all the other things where, yeah, which are just not really working yet on Linux mainland.
Yeah, yeah.
So from what I've seen, it got a lot of interest, a lot of interest, and a lot of people asked questions afterwards,
and you set up a matrix room where a lot of people joined already, so a lot of good ideas already, people proposing stuff,
and yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, my goal is just to get people thinking and talking about it,
because I don't know what the answers are really, but I have some ideas.
Yeah, it's good to bring this up and coordinate on it.
I think there's no answer, and I think it's not solved on the rest of either.
Yeah, especially the thing is, while it's unsolvable, you must work on trying to solve it,
but otherwise, things get worse and worse, so it's tedious, but necessary and good for,
well, also mental health, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All this duplicate effort, right?
Yeah, yeah.
When someone's working on a thing, and then somebody else commits that matrix right before,
then that can be.
It can be a little bit motivating, and yeah, it's not too great, so.
Like, maybe from past examples, I guess, what Dylan did, like, with the oldest Bluetooth audio thing,
so like, with the car control and everything there, like, it would have been basically a topic for this, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.
Because, I mean, it's not specific to post-markerized, so any other Linux is just, yeah, just in general.
Yeah, yeah, there's lots of examples of duplicated effort, or things being implemented that, like, the whole MMS support,
I mean, that was, that turned out well because, I mean, I was one of the early contributors with Chris, and.
And it worked out pretty well for us, but a lot of distros, like, kind of make some changes to it after the fact,
and so they were trying to play catch-up, and, yeah, it would have been easier if just, like, everyone who wanted this was at the table when it was being worked on,
and could provide input, so the first thing that came out was, like, gonna work, I guess.
Yeah, and I think it's also powerful to have, like, some shared website, maybe, where it's easier for people who have no clue about what this world is, basically, to get a first idea of what the project happened.
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, one of the really cool things that happened during my talk at the end was, there was a person there who was not technical at all.
He actually, like, worked for a school district in this area, and which is here just out of interest, and he was really excited that, in my talk, I mentioned, like, we need to be better about communicating publicly what we're doing to non-technical people, so they have some idea, like, what's going on, and what we're all about, and why it's a good thing.
And so, just hearing that from somebody, like, yeah, I have no idea what you're about, and it's frustrating today, because there's a lot of information, and it's mostly technical, and so, people, like, he was, like, people, like, me, get frustrated trying to piece it all together, and, you know, give up.
Yeah, so, that was nice.
And, like, also, kind of, given that there's a whole deaf room for it at first time, like, but there's no, like, for example, if you go to containers, I mean, there's a Wikipedia page for it that explains, like, what this, what it does, or a million other blog posts, but for the first mobile devices, like, why should you care?
Why is it important? What exists? What can you do with it?
Exactly.
So, who didn't say much yet?
I don't know, I'll chip in, I guess. I thought it was really well laid out. I was kind of hyped to see Clayton's look at the end.
Yeah, very nice closing talk for sure.
It really, at the end of the day, so well, and, like, the...
Thanks.
Yeah, it was perfect. So, you should absolutely go catch the recordings. I think, depending on this is released, they may be linked down below.
Maybe you should be able to see them.
Yeah, I don't know how fast FOSTEM is released in the videos.
I think everything after 1 pm, they have sent out review emails, but everything before it was some technical issue.
It's like next week or so.
Just look for it, we will link it.
Yeah, I guess moving on. I have to say it's amazing seeing all of the bases. I know we kind of open with this, but...
Yeah, I didn't get involved in the community until off to COVID.
So this is the first time for me meeting, like, the dozens of people I interact with online sites.
I don't know, it's super cool.
Yeah.
I've been working with some folks here for, like, almost six years now, and still have a single person.
So, first time for me too, and it's awesome.
I have a funny story from yesterday, so we were at a restaurant, and they wanted us to tell them via email which food we want to order beforehand, so they can prepare it.
And we did that.
And then the food arrived, and we didn't know what we put down there.
So we said, okay, put all the food on the table, and we looked up in our etherpad.
Who ordered what food?
It works out. It was fine. That's great.
That's great food.
But it was also kind of amazing at first, and it's like, you see, just not just software people, but people involved in the whole community, from every single area.
It's like from the Free Software Foundation in Europe, I saw some people again that I met at some points.
And I was actually from my previous job, like, one guy came by and said hello.
He was there for the weekends.
It was super cool.
There are also a list of people who have contributed to post-microlysis in some way who came by.
I saw some people who have done some sound-dragon 845 things, just show up, and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's you.
Awesome.
I could see you, like David Hiddelberg, I guess.
Yep.
Yeah.
It's cool stuff.
Definitely.
Did anybody see any other talks that were cool?
Outside of the bedroom?
Outside of the bedroom.
Doesn't seem like it now.
Apparently you have seen any talks.
I've seen anyone.
Two other talks outside the bedroom?
Yeah.
So if you're in the embedded room at the end, it was like one about medical respirators, like Open Heart Project, which was actually quite fascinating.
Like, I was actually for the talk before and for the talk after, but I stayed in between.
It was really interesting.
Like Open Heart was just cool in general, I think.
Especially when they build this modular and stuff like this.
It's really cool to see.
Yeah, and it was very intentionally designed that way too, which is cool, because this...
I think it was a non-profit company that very explicitly went for this type of design.
So that other people could build them in the world, and I mean respirators are, you know, important when you need them.
So making it easily reconstructed elsewhere without having to go through licensing and whatever required that you probably have to do if you wanted to get one.
There was an Open Heart right now, it was nice.
So yeah, that was cool talk.
Yeah, that was amazing.
On the topic of Open Heart, we also had the M&T pocket reform at the stand today.
That was cool.
Yeah, I'm not interested in M&T for coming along, I guess.
No, it's nice.
I'm trying to think of things to say.
I ran on thing that Peter noted on us, I think, that two presentations were run on phones actually, right in the definitely.
Really?
Yeah, cool.
So the first one, which was about Lumery and Convergence, so running on a Fairphone 4, running Ubuntu Touch,
run from the phone, felt like I've read that down that before, because it was so chill.
Yeah, just did it right and started in time still.
I also had my USB keyboard with me.
He even used it and it went super smoothly.
And it was funny, because the device kept locking every so often.
Yeah, it just seamlessly kept going.
Not another problem.
He made jokes about it, that's why I wanted to move on or something.
It's been too long on the slide, it locks.
Great talk.
And the other one was from Mobian.
Yeah, I think it was by my liberal.
No, liberal five.
Yeah, it was by my liberal five.
Right on the nice stock.
Yeah.
It was very made for the liberal five.
It probably wasn't, because I don't think it was made.
It barely fits that thing.
It didn't look like it fits.
So it's a block for the liberal five.
The best connectors on the side.
Very cool.
I was not brave enough to try that.
Yeah, I was magic happy to finish up my target.
So I think actually I think in like 20, I guess 2020, I think we were like for the
pine for the original pine phone.
We were also kind of planning to do a talk on the pine from itself, like using
convergence or kind of convergence.
Back in the end, plucking in an external display and doing it with it.
But I don't think we actually did this in the end.
But yeah, I mean, now we had at least two talks on it and super nice.
Next year, all the talks.
It works.
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
Actually, we'll be talking about the one person who had a laptop.
Oh, it's from our service.
Somebody doesn't throw us the software stack.
Yes.
And then for USB.
I think we could be recorded on a Linux phone maybe two.
Outside of the bedroom, there was one talk on camera stuff in the first mobile
bedroom, but there were two more in the bedroom.
And that had a talk by a load camera.
Yeah.
One about the camera and one about all the new devices which may or may not be relevant
to pine for too.
I don't know.
So I have to catch up on those.
Yeah.
I just have a lot of talks on my list today.
Unfortunately enough to get time to get to because there's so many people here.
Yeah.
That's how advice I want to talk to.
Just track us all by track.
But yeah, I still have to really have to catch up on some.
Whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was great.
Amazing.
Yeah.
Any more stories you want to tell anyone?
Wow.
That was the one.
Yeah.
Have to date you.
But Martijn doesn't plan to carry the podcast equipment tomorrow.
So.
Yeah, we have to release two episodes.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Not to that.
I think there's still going to be a lot of amazing track talks tomorrow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can also, I mean, yeah.
Now when you hear this episode, you can watch the recordings of it.
Yeah.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe you can come next time.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Come 2024.
Probably first week in February, most likely.
The first week in the February.
Definitely in Brussels.
Yes.
We'll get a move again.
And a deaf room again.
I don't think any other university would be willing to host so many people with like so many
rooms open at the same time.
No.
Yeah.
Or I recruit another team that sets it up.
Because I mean, I don't know.
I think we had 30 or 40 rooms in parallel.
And they all had a beautiful maid's first-hand box like the video box with like a big bag of adapters for like.
I mean, for the first mobile devices room, we had literally we needed a VGA to HMI adapter.
And of course, it wasn't a bag.
It was so funny.
Like they were panicking of it like who has the adapter and did the first row.
I don't know.
Nobody had something and then we figured, oh, there's a bag with an adapter in the front.
It was funny.
But it actually worked fine.
I mean, it was like a wonderful adapter with an actual USB connection.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
I believe about the camera.
This was also a great talk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was definitely a 220 or 230.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, so one.
Okay.
I've been to a lot of conferences for like previous jobs.
And this is the first conference I've been to where I traveled to another country.
And went through passport control.
And the officer there was like, are you here for the open source conference?
It was really.
I was like, yeah.
It was like, okay.
I let's click on one.
We're going to sell it if you said no.
I don't know.
Probably still be there now.
I guess.
I need to do the full check three hours.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look at the searching.
Like what else would an American do in Brussels?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not festival right now.
Yeah.
And London value had to start.
No.
This is here.
The airport.
Yeah.
And my connection was in the UK, which is, you know, not part of the EU anymore.
Yeah.
So this is my part of the country.
And yeah.
Wow.
Not the only connection.
Yeah.
A long trip.
Yeah.
What?
I hope it was worth it in the end.
Yeah.
I think so.
I'm so far.
I'm still winging up.
But yeah.
I think it's a little jet lag.
But not too bad.
And I must say it's amazing to do this podcast here outside in front of the cafeteria.
Lots of noise in the background.
That's what it actually adds to the experience.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's authentic.
And by the way, we have four different microphones.
Yes.
And it's all connected to a fancy recording box.
Yeah.
This is the first time using all this hardware.
Yeah.
And happy it works.
Or does it.
But I also fancy headphones on to monitor what we're talking about.
It's like a radio DJ.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not really professional.
Yes.
And the stage still may end up being the quickest recording of a podcast episode ever, I think.
Maybe.
Maybe.
We don't have any delay between talking.
It's a natural conversation.
Yeah.
It makes discussion so much easier also because you can see each other.
Yeah.
You know when somebody wants to say something.
Do you remember that I shouldn't just nod along but also say, yeah.
No.
We should notice every month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like get laid over and then.
We'll be halfway like in the boot in the Atlantic.
Yeah.
Can't be fine.
Let's get a boot.
Yeah.
Of course we're going to ask boot.
Yeah.
Sure.
Crews.
There we go.
I mean, probably from half ways on the east coast of the year.
Yeah.
Like North Carolina or something.
Probably not where you are.
No.
People are walking past with trollies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not the first one.
A few cars.
That's fine.
That's good.
Yeah.
So shall we wrap it up?
Castel?
Yeah.
We have almost exactly 30 minutes now.
Oh, amazing.
Nice.
It has a time.
So as long as you don't cut anything out, we're exactly 30 minutes.
Yeah.
But you also need to record the outro now, of course, the Atlantic, foster outro.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I will try to remember the text.
I don't know.
You want to do it?
I don't remember it.
Okay.
I'm a little rusty.
Yeah.
Something like.
I thought you were crafty.
Yeah.
No.
Rusty.
Yeah, I made something up.
It's plastic, guys.
Thank you for listening to our episode.
We hope you enjoyed it.
That's part of it.
I'm not sure if it's anything.
I think we're more infusey as them, please.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll try again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you for listening to our episode.
If you want to comment about it, leave a comment that Maserun posed.
If you want to buy a shirt, head over to Postmark, rest the dog slash.
Merch.
And if you want to do none of that, that's also fine.
Yeah.
Have a great day, I guess.
That's not fine.
And I will sing the outro music.
