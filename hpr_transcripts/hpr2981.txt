Hi everybody, my name is Tenthalon
and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
This is the VNG News Show for December 2019.
Joining me tonight is?
Hi, it's Dave Morris.
Hi Dave, how are you? Happy New Year.
And happy new year to you too.
Yes, thank you very much. I'm fine yourself.
I'm...
Yes, had a busy day, had a busy Christmas.
Good in part.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay though, yeah, it's new year.
It's all that good stuff.
It's a good remember to type 2020202019
and all of these jolly things.
Exactly.
Remember anybody walking around this week asking what year it is
are time travelers.
Anyway, this is the HPR Community News Show
which is a monthly look at what's been going on in the HPR community.
It's a regular show scheduled for the first hot Monday of the month
and just to tell you what HPR is, if this is your first time tuning in.
HPR is an internet show podcast that releases shows every weekday,
Monday to Friday.
HPR is a long lineage going back to Radio Freak America,
Binary Revolution Radio and Infonomicon.
It is a direct continuation of today with a techie radio
and please listen to Stank Dog's introduction for more information.
They HPR Community, what difference is it's HPR from other
podcasts is the shows are crowdsourced from the community.
Fellow listeners like you.
There are no restrictions on how long the shows can be,
nor on the topic's second cover, so long as they're not spam
and are of interest to hackers.
If you want to see a list of topics that have been covered so far,
have a look in our archive and you also allow for a series of shows
so that hosts can give more details on a particular topic.
You can download and listen to the shows on the website
or subscribe using your favorite podcasting client
to automatically get new shows as they are available.
You can copy and redistribute the shows for free,
provided you adhere to Creative Commons Attribution,
share like 3.0 License.
Free Culture, hacker public radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge
we do not accept donations so please consider supporting our patrons.
If you listen to HPR, we would love you to contribute one show a year.
Our shows are by default released under Creative Commons Attribution,
share like 3.0, imported license.
All the software you use is free software,
all the code we developed is published on our GitLab repositories.
All media is available via the feeds.
We are going through another process to release the code for the website as well.
Governance, HPR is entirely community-driven.
Policy decisions are proposed and discussed on the mailing list,
which is open to anyone to join.
Mail list discussions are brought to the attention
of the listening community on the first Monday of the month
in the HPR community news show, which is what you're listening to now.
This show is open to anyone to participate in.
The schedule for the community news show can be downloaded as an iCal calendar
containing recording dates for the next 12 months.
Thank you, Dave.
Our reminder is also sent out to the mailing list in the week before the recording.
Our hosting is kindly provided to us by Josh Knapp,
as an honesthost.com, and he has the last word in issues related to site security.
A changing team of volunteers called the admins or janitors of volunteers
deal with the day-to-day operation of HPR.
Right now you're listening to two of them, that's myself and Dave.
Acting as the first point of contact, processing the shows,
coordinating policy decisions, removing spam, updating the website, etc.
They are contactable via the email account admin at hprichropublicradio.com.
They have no more say over policy than anyone else.
Anyone who has shown non-term dedication to the project,
and just trusted by the community, can become an admins.
See more information on the link.
And for the more, we would like you to please consider supporting
Josh at an honesthost.com, and also considering becoming a donator to archive
that org who provide hosting for HPR and many other shows.
That day was the about the PHP page, which has come to my attention.
Nobody bothers to read, folks.
Everybody needs to know this one.
So as first show of the year, that is our about page.
I recognize it, I knew what it was.
You would do Dave, because you contributed to it.
Now, why is that important, Dave?
Because we have requested a policy change,
which we will talk about later on in this show,
as a result of some naughty behavior.
Actually, notice, I don't want to make a little of this.
People have been harassed.
HPR hosts have been harassed.
And this harassment has been brought to our attention,
the another podcast.
I've been in discussion with that person.
We have requested that the people come forward.
They have not done so.
They've only done so to the other host.
And they have not come forward to me or you other day.
But don't think.
No, no, no, no.
If there are people who have been harassed,
who are in any way related to HPR,
or in any way harassed after posting shows here,
that is definitely not what sharing knowledge is all about.
Yeah?
If you've got a problem, yeah.
I won't go into it.
We'll cover it later on.
But I just wanted to bring to everybody's attention
that people might be under the impression
that Dave and I run HPR,
or we are just bash scripts waiting to happen.
In your case, a pro scripted.
Yes, so with that in mind,
we have the HPR community news with the view
to giving positive and constructive feedback
on every show that there has been in the last month.
And we will start with the HPR community news for 2019,
which was 2956, shall we do?
Well, before we do that,
we're not going to go to a new host to comment upon.
We should do so.
Because that is tradition.
The abolition that you introduced them.
Indeed, indeed.
As far as Paul is waiting to do it.
We have a new host, one new host this month,
and it is Paul Quirk,
who has already contributed several shows,
which some of which we'll be talking about as we go through this episode.
Excellent.
Yes.
Thank you.
Actually, I've processed so many of Paul Shaw's now.
I was feeling like he's one of the regulars.
So keep them coming.
Please do.
Anyway, the community news.
We only had one comment.
And that was...
That was Jezra.
And we were talking with Yerun about the postcard request he had for his daughter.
And Yerun said, could it stop now, please?
And Jezra says,
no more postcards, tag, nabbit, just sent another one.
Excellent.
I'm sure it was appreciated.
Yes, indeed.
Lord D's film reviews.
This is Lost and Brunx,
tribute to Lord D.
There were three comments.
And I'll do the first one, which was from me.
Great series, but high-lost and big great series.
Great episode and great series.
Can I ask you to include the link of the next movie in the previous one,
as it will be nice to have the ability to play along,
just like to do on the HPR Boot Club.
Speaking of the HPR Boot Club.
That's right.
The Lost and Brunx says, links.
I can do that, though it requires that I have the next one lined up in advance.
That's a lot of organization.
And of course, this is not an exclusive series.
Anyone can post a review and do it in any way they like.
To which I replied, good point.
That said, anyone planning an episode could add a comment to your episode or ping the mailing list.
And that of course will qualify as I or you a show.
Speaking of the HPR Boot Club.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, you've made the point.
For those of you who don't know about the HPR Boot Club,
there are several shows already recorded.
And I think they're waiting on one that is on the failed hard disk to be recovered.
Oh, I sat in the problem.
Yeah, exactly.
Okay.
Okay, looking forward to that then at some point.
So the following day was 295-8,
two-quatorital with Pascal modules and how you define them and use them.
The reminded me a little bit of the modules in Pearl.
I passed when I was listening along.
Yes, yes.
Well, I guess in other languages as well,
that whole business of defining a thing as a sort of blob of code
and then using it elsewhere and the various ways in which you can import stuff
or make use of it, make it visible.
So yeah, it was, it wasn't surprising,
but it was interesting to see how it's done in Haskell.
One of the few Haskell shows I've understood quite quite well.
And that's a bonus, no fall till two-quatorital.
No, no, absolutely not now.
One day I shall understand it better.
And the following day was an interview with Josh Clemmings about gpodder.net.
And yeah, do you want to read the comment?
There was a short I did.
Yeah, it was a comment from Be Easy,
who says, no problem.
I'll do it.
Great show, Ken.
I've been minimally involved in gpodder.net since Stefan first made his announcements.
Actually, I was the one that put his original post on the Jupiter Broadcasting
and Ubuntu podcast telegram channels.
I've been looking for a way to contribute more.
And I think this show has provided me an answer, data management stuff.
Well, that would be the easiest thing.
That would be right up his alley.
That was my ass out.
Going back to the comment.
I'm already on the Slack channel, so I'll contact them directly.
So yeah, very good.
I'd like to hear how that all goes.
Keep up the good work, he says.
I missed that bit.
I'd like to hear more.
He won't reply to that.
And that is.
Excellent.
That is what's exactly the sort of response that we want together.
I'm just going to step away for a second because I've got a noisy cat.
Excuse me.
No worries.
Okay.
So the following day was dehydrated foods, which oddly enough is something that my wife has
been doing for the last six years or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, I find it fascinating.
I do eat dehydrated foods, but I buy them.
And I think what I hope it's doing here is it's going to be a lot more cost effective.
Because the reasoning behind it is it's very, very sound.
So yeah, I think it does.
Well, it does.
Yeah, well, it's doing.
Go on.
It depends largely on the amount of fluid in the thing that you're trying to dry.
So we were getting a lot of vegetables, you know, at the end of the market.
At the time when the market was closing and then the, you know, the,
just vegetable salad was only a bit rid of the stuff.
And then we'd freeze it at that point or dehydrated at that point.
Well, it can take two or three days of constant, constant working to, to do it.
To get this right.
Yeah.
And it stinks out the house a little bit as well.
And I never actually, but I have one of those power meter things just to see how much power it takes.
Much electricity it takes to do that.
Of course, if you're running off your own solar panels that will be as big an issue.
Yeah, it's, it's something I'd like to look into anyway.
It's trying fruit and that type of stuff would be, would be quite good.
Although you still, if you're diabetic, like Hooker and I both are, then you've got to watch it because you can eat.
A lot more fruit and therefore get a lot more sugar.
They don't lose the sugar without realizing it.
If you, if you go too far down that road, but yeah, but it's a great idea.
Yeah, my wife is just more for having ready meals, you know,
that if you're making spaghetti or something and you just have a jar of vegetables ready to rock.
And don't put in, you know, all the, you call them chilies and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
And then they expand themselves and the only difference you can tell that they're,
they're dehydrated was, you know, that they're caught quite accurately.
And as opposed to, you're just chopped up and hacked in on the, yeah.
But here again, here's the show, you know, dehydrated foods, you know,
you don't need to be a programmer or a, you know, quantum physicist to,
publish shows of interest tackers here and take note.
No, no, no, and this is, this is no good stuff.
Speaking of good stuff, Daniel Pearson put in a very, very good little,
a summary of Kubernetes, which I would like to put in a time capsule,
send back two years and give to myself.
I hope you're awesome.
Yes.
Yes, this was, this was very concentrated.
It was like it was dehydrated, information normals.
It was, I found it fascinating, but one of those I noted,
going listen to it again several times because it's a lot of condensed information in there.
Very well done.
Yeah.
Was good to have, good to have on there.
And Brian and Ohio continues his bike building project the next day.
Takes me forever to scroll down.
Yes.
No, it was good.
I enjoyed this.
And I love these pictures.
The pictures make, make it really, really interesting.
I think.
Yeah, absolutely.
A deep insight into, into all the bits and pieces and the components and the methods and stuff.
So yeah.
So I do the, do the first comment.
Yeah.
Okay.
Petard says, I really enjoyed this.
Thanks very much for making and posting this.
I massively enjoyed listening, even if nearly everything about it is and will be,
I would reach for me for the foreseeable future.
I'm a city creature and nothing resembling brazing is happening in any of my spaces anytime soon.
I listened to this on my phone with only the benefit of the title on the screen and not the show notes.
And I have to say I was really expecting that the spoke bike building was referring to the spoke building.
As bikes are a bike shape.
Absolutely.
That's lovely.
I love those.
Confusion.
So yeah.
Yeah.
Excellent.
Excellent response.
And John Kolb.
Excellent progress.
This is looking really good.
I wish I'd known about the affordable touch you're using when I built mine.
Torch.
Torch.
Yes.
That's the one.
Torch.
Thank you, Dee.
I would definitely have bought one and probably sped up my completely, completely, completely busy because,
because I kept having to wait for our metal shop to open at the time I could go.
I was, it was especially nice to hear your reaction to learning how to breathe as well,
because as a novice, I went to the same series of emotions, kind of scared the first,
completely stoked after a couple of successful joints.
It's very empowering to learn something like this, isn't it?
Looking forward to the next episode.
As a region.
Yeah.
And the mistakes and that remind our jobs.
Now, I didn't, I'd never occurred to me to, to buy stuff to do, brazing.
It's a pretty hefty.
Torch.
It's, it's one of the burns or mattic ones, I think, that's very popular in the States.
I don't know, I've never seen it in the UK, but I'm sure there's an equivalent.
I learned to braze at school.
We had metal work at school back in the sixties and then it was a gas and air.
Gas and oxygen, maybe type, type gun thing that, that was there.
So, but yeah, it's just something to get a mixture of, of gases to get the heat, I think, is the, is the main issue.
So yeah, very cool, very cool, I'd like to, quite tempted to do something.
I want to learn to weld as well.
Do, you know, do full blown welding at some stage, but afraid I'd set my garage on fire.
I see any trouble.
Start with the stick welding.
Yeah, that's what they say.
That's what they say.
I was going to go for, for me, welding to be honest, because it's cheap.
I think it's easier to get the, get the kit.
But yeah, I've heard people say using, use stick welding is, teaches you better, better technique.
And it also, it's after doing stick welding, megan, tigers a lot easier.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I see the stuff can be picked up relatively cheaply these days.
So, it's something, it's even in little the German supermarket.
They sell, sell these things.
So, yeah, something to do this year, I think.
Yep.
Next show.
I walk through my PyFace CAD Python called Park 3, and this was a show from one of the series
by Mr X who recorded a long show and basically lit it up and went through his, his code.
Great series.
Just wanted to comment that this has been a great series.
It's been fun to hear about all the ways that you've customized your podcast listening experience.
At first, it sounded like we'd heard it all after you covered the harder.
But listening to the options you put in the menus, you've really got a lot more in there.
My guess would be that you're not done either.
Maybe you never will be.
Smiley face.
Thanks for the show.
Have always been a fan of your intro music.
I was Gabriel Eve and fire.
And Mr X replies, re great series.
Hi Gabriel, thanks for the nice comments.
Glad you've enjoyed the series.
I do very little hacking on this project these days.
But I think you're right about it, never being finished.
Just the other day, I included a feature when downloading podcasts to include in the message.
How many podcasts were downloaded?
Also glad you enjoyed the intro music.
I've probably already mentioned it was something I pulled together many years ago using Cakewalk Studio.
Maybe version four and a creative lab sound blaster AWE 32 sound card.
I used a MIDI keyboard to pull it together.
To be honest, it's been that long since I've played a keyboard I'm not sure I still can.
Anyway, thanks for taking the time to comment and all the best Mr X.
Excellent.
Yeah.
Come on.
Not far out.
I'm just going to remark that it has been quite a thing.
It's something about certain people who go into enormous detail and build enormous complexity to do stuff.
I have some people who have raspberry pies monitoring the HPR.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know what it is.
It must be something in the water up there in Scotland.
Probably.
Anyway, following day, bullows and bow ties, neckwear for nerds.
I talk about this is John Colt where he talks about ties.
At least the kind of like to wear when the occasion calls for it.
And I had no idea.
Well, actually, I commented.
He, yes, he questioned in the show whether it was of interest to hackers.
Yes, it is of interest to hackers.
Because I did not know.
Then what the baller was.
Who is the guy modeling the ties because he looks like nothing like the junk hope in my head.
Yes.
And that refers to the images associated with the.
Yes, he's got a.
Some things that you can click on and try.
Yes, John Colt replies the model can.
I know he doesn't sound so bald headed on the radio.
People are always surprised by this when we meet face to face.
That's not what it meant.
No, no, no.
He has a sense of humor just doing nothing.
That was great.
I found this quite interesting.
I've heard of.
I've heard of these ties.
I mean, I've seen people wearing them too.
The ballers ones.
The ball.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But I was thinking as he was taught as John was talking about it.
What is this boy with the baller come from?
So I did a did a search.
And of course, this is from Bollywood or a.
From the pamphlets of South America where these.
The gap shows use balls two or three.
Waits on on on string on rope to bring down.
The animals are hunting.
Oh, it's it's based is based on that basically a sort of blob on a string.
To have a fair.
So yeah, it's quite interesting history.
Now, I'd seen them a lot in the States when I was there.
But I've never never known what they were called.
They're kind of cool because you can get all sorts of get all sorts of emblems and things.
And I'm not considering wearing a bow tie.
Dave, who would have thought it?
Yes.
Yes.
The tying of it is going to be going to be a great skill.
It was common.
It was common for kids of my age to wear bowties and I was small.
But they were always they were always clip on ones.
I had a wardrobe of clip on one.
I never learned how to do a proper proper bow tie.
So you can do it.
You'll have to do a show on it.
So speaking of getting people to do shows, instant feedback for students in maths.
This is an interview or this is Benny where he helped him submit his own show.
On this piece of software that they're working on on a website.
And you commented?
Well, I did, didn't I?
Yeah, yeah.
I was reading my notes here.
Hi, Benny.
Cool project.
I said,
I remember maxima.
The predecessor of that was spelled differently.
M-A-C-S-Y-M-A.
The predecessor of maxima was spelled M-A-X-I-M-A, which Benny's using.
To receive a process algebra.
I'm mathematically challenged.
But I spent a fair bit of my working life in IT writing glue code to make bits of software.
Talk to one another.
This sounds like quite an undertaking.
Good luck with it.
Very cool, actually.
I was quite impressed with this.
He'd mentioned it at some point.
I'd heard him say talking about it, but I didn't really understood the ins and outs of it.
So very, very good.
Yeah.
Cool.
That was a tough look before.
Is he going to foster?
Not that I know of.
The same.
The same.
Yeah, I know.
No, I know.
It's, uh...
He's never been to...
To...
Voss them, in my knowledge, because...
Well, he used to be a maths teacher, and he collided with his term-times and stuff,
or his old camera, didn't.
But, uh...
Yeah.
I'll maybe ask him if he's going to be nice to me up with him.
Yep.
So the following day was the first show by Paul Crook.
And it was the world of Commodore 2019 episode one.
I always like to see episode one coming into a title day, because you know what that means.
More shows for us.
One of many.
John said, John Colp says, uh...
Legacy tech.
Thanks for the really interesting first episode.
I don't have a history with Commodore's apart from a 1981 novelty belt buckle with a pet computer on it.
But it sounds like a fun event, and I geek out on all technology.
Thanks for including the pictures.
Look forward to more episodes.
So I said, great show.
Thanks for this, Paul.
A great first show, and some interesting interviews.
I never owned a Commodore computer, but I worked in a university that had many of them.
I remember visiting one of the engineering departments in the early 1980s, which had a lab full of Commodore pets.
I was impressed by the way, the top of the case with the monitor attached.
We lifted up, kept in position like working on the engine of a car.
I bought a BBC model.
Yeah, they did that.
They had a sort of hinge on the back.
The whole top covered up.
I bought a BBC model B for my own use around that time.
This was another 6502 based machine, which was very popular in the UK.
And my workplace ended up with lots of these, too.
Looking forward to hearing your further episodes on this subject.
I'll see what we're all doing there.
Anyway, the following day was the dude with his series on wrestling.
As you like it, episode two.
And this one.
Give him a listen to shows on your back.
And as I think of these, I'm back where I was listening to them at the time.
And this one I was listening to.
The top of my, of the attic, very cold attic during a storm in my mother's house,
connecting opera fiber into that connection to downstairs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It does.
Yes, there's a strange association of this sort of thing.
It's a music with, with, with places and, and that type of thing.
All sorts of audio.
Yes, I do know what you mean.
So, um, but this was actually a very interesting show.
I, I really genuinely thought, uh, when you start an office series and I'll,
okay, this sort of interest actors.
And now I find myself longing for the next episode to know when it's going to come in.
Cause it's a fascinating insight.
And, uh, B Ronaldo says, WWE, interesting info.
I remember the area in the, I remember in the early 90s watching the WWF with my dad.
Now I know why they changed the name to WWE, the panda won the fight.
And if you have, there's not all what that means, listen to the episode.
I do remember that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The, uh, worldwide fun for nature.
It's, it's very, very incensed that somebody was pinching their, their, uh, their name.
I do remember that.
Yeah.
I'd forgotten completely about it.
It was quite interesting to hear again.
And the next day we had some old geezer waffling on about how he killed some birds.
He didn't kill many.
Well, a dad of natural causes, honest girl.
Not being fed.
Listen to natural cause, dude.
Hi.
Yeah, yeah.
This was by our esteem, our esteemed host, Mr. David Morris.
Anyone call you David?
Uh, yeah.
It was, it was called that when I was naughty at home as a child.
So, yeah, tried to avoid us much as possible.
You know how it is.
Yeah.
Taxman and your mother when she's annoyed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cannot fall on a little girl.
That's never good.
No.
Uh, very interesting.
And I like the way, as always, the show notes and stuff.
I wonder how you're going to get from vast to running HPR.
Haha.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's away.
Yeah.
I'm going to speed these up because I hit the, I hit the doldrums for a while.
And I'm about to stop learning this because, as I said, in the thing that I was trying to find research.
I was trying to research things so I could point out pictures and references to stuff and I couldn't find anything.
Because, you know, it was that, that sort of dead time of the internet that people never bothered to,
to upload, I guess.
But, uh, well, so I find that even a lot of stuff that you think is permanent on the internet is gone.
Yeah, basically that added Joe and nothing ever disappears on the internet.
Nothing you ever want to disappear disappears from the internet, but
quite often the stuff that you don't want to disappear.
Yeah, anyway, look who just turned up, Dave.
I see. Yes.
I gave him real. Hey, how's it going, guys?
Sorry, I'm late. I just read the time.
Thought I was doing early.
No worries. I completely forgot about it entirely.
So I just happened to be on my PC and then we're starting
and I'll be there in a few minutes.
I've got the cup of tea.
Oh, good. I'm glad I'm not alone.
I don't know. Why don't I?
What do I have to do? I mean, there's calendars everywhere.
Yeah, I've added the calendars.
But I'm going around all day thinking that it's Sunday for some strange reason.
Oh, this having Christmas and New Year in the middle of the week,
really messes you out.
Doesn't it? You don't know what day it is.
Oh, definitely, definitely.
But yeah, okay.
Now we're finally back to a weekend.
So things should be regular from here on out.
Yes. Yes.
So yes.
Yeah, I think we finished talking about that show and I'm working on the next one,
which hopefully will come out sometime in this year if I can pull my finger out and get on with it.
So the next day we're already up to 2969,
crewing a small, a spaceship in Haskell,
something I never, ever considered that you would need to do.
But there you go.
Every spaceship in a game needs a crew to operate smaller ships,
have fewer components of wireless crew than a huge one with lots of components.
This is fascinating stuff.
The detail that to Toto has gone into with this is just just amazing.
It's just, I mean, over all the time with these things.
Yeah, definitely.
It just adds this very similar to it, right?
It makes the world all that more real and engaging definitely.
It makes me feel very guilty now if I look at the game and, you know,
download it and know, yeah, not interesting and just get rid of it.
All the work that has gone into something like that.
Absolutely.
Especially if it's written in Haskell, I guess.
But just the whole process of thinking these things through and the interaction
between the bits of it and so forth.
It's amazing.
So the following day,
Ahuka was back with a request, I think, for the Fediverse about social media
and how it all connects together.
And this was a, this was an interesting one on the groundwork for, you know,
a social movement, I think.
Yeah, I definitely, it'll be interesting to see how this, this moves forward
hearing that you have these different social media groups that are sort of,
they're not all agreeing on the same protocols.
And so how are, you know, we want them on the one hand, people want, you know,
ever want their data to be transportable.
But on the other, you know, how are we going to arrive at a consensus here?
And, and, and is it, is it just going to eventually, or we're going to get a
critical mass where everybody's just going to, okay, this has got to be it.
Or we're going to end up with factions while we support this, we support this.
And then are they're going to be glued together?
It's going to be very interesting to watch.
I don't think actually they, you know, in the fluttering, it's necessarily
that's cut and dry in a proprietary word, perhaps, but, you know,
there's no reason why you can't support two, both protocols.
Yeah, this is a protocol we'd like you to use because we need this functionality,
but if you can't, then you can always use this additional one.
So I think it's, it's not something to be as worried about in the pre-open
source software as it would be in other areas.
Yeah, that's true.
There's definitely more room for hope there.
And, you know, I guess it'll all depend on, you know, which developers decide
to, you know, to get off their butts and say, hey, you know what, this is worth
doing and, and, and make adapt, make adaptions for, for their, their platform of choice.
I was impressed at how much work a hooker had done to prepare for this,
actually, because there's a lot of, a lot of information here that I just knew
that some of these things existed, but just, it was just a list in my mind.
But he, he, he gone into a lot more detail than I had had done myself.
I found that to be really quite, quite good and there's some great links,
which I, I must follow up.
I didn't know that Jabba had, um, changed into, into, I forgot what it changed to,
but, uh, XMP, XMPP is it?
Yeah, and it's being used in IoT.
I, I did I get that right or have I, have I come to like jump things?
No, that's true.
Yeah.
So, yeah, that, that is really interesting.
I must dig around in, in that a bit more.
So the following day we had the world of Commodore 2019 episode, do hacking
Gek OS and my first thoughts with this was, oh my God.
Did, did, did, oh, did, oh my gosh, who's, you're going to try and run a multi-user
operating system on that?
Wow.
This is going to be fun.
Um, yes, yes, absolutely.
Why, why says he spending all his days and nights doing this sort of stuff?
So yeah, I have, I, I, I just, you know, have to, uh, I didn't quite catch and
maybe, maybe you guys did, but I mean, what is he writing the sentence?
Is there, is it, is he porting it to every different assembly language?
Cause it's not like there are a lot of high level languages for the Commodore 64.
I don't know.
I got the impression it was an assembler, but, but I don't, I don't actually know, um,
is it not specifically for the 6502 that he was building it?
I, I thought, I thought he ported it originally from a, a different platform.
Okay.
I missed that then, yeah, but maybe, um, yeah, I thought he had something like a, was
it a PDP or originally and then, oh, you were right.
Actually, yes, you're right.
He, he was saying that the PDP, which were, I guess we, we think it's being
fairly, fairly underpowered and, um, inflexible these days was, uh, was
it's where it'd come from, but it, but it had a far richer instruction set
than the 6502 and features like, um, uh, Colonel level and user level and, and
that type of thing.
So yeah, I remember, I remember that now.
So yeah, quite an achievement then.
Yeah, I guess it must have been a lot of, uh, a lot of code.
I guess, but it's, it once you have the design, then, um, maybe it's, it's not
so bad as long as you know exactly what you, you know, how do you want the
abstractions to, to sort of shape out, but still it's, it's quite, quite a, uh,
an endeavor in the, yeah, yeah.
Not, not a thing I would ever have considered doing, uh, it was quite a lot
of 6502 development when I was, uh, back in the sort of late 70s, early 80s type
of time that I was sort of vaguely involved with, but these were just sort of
stand alone programs effectively, but, uh, many of the BBC micro and that,
that type of thing.
So the thought of a full operating system was not a thing we considered at all.
Well, I, I will say one thing I didn't, uh, since I joined later and get to
make the comment on the first one, but I, you know, he certainly sold me on
wanting to go to this, uh, the, the, uh, Commodore conference because, um, I,
I certainly enjoyed that in, uh, years past.
And it's been, you know, wonderful to hear about all the, uh, the ways
people are, are still involved with that piece of hardware and, and all of the,
you know, it's neat nuances and whatnot.
So, um, just have to figure out how to, how to make time for it now.
I have a sauce pot for Commodore who was the first computer I've ever used.
Yes.
The following day we had Mr. X and Dave Morris at the foot of a ski school in
Scotland.
You know, you had that, uh, mountain snow, dude.
Haha.
No, no, it's one of these dried ski slope thingies.
Yeah.
Sort of a giant carpet type of thing.
Oh, this is very much a, a, uh, sitting outside having a coffee with the
lads type.
Uh, sure.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It was, uh, we sat in studios, see as we call it, which was my car.
Oh, it's a real iceberg.
I, uh, I had, I did favorite work on the audio to try and remove the,
the sound of the inside of the car type of type of thing.
So, uh, it might even do an HBR briefly on what I did to the audio to try and
make it a little bit easier to listen to.
Uh, but yeah, it's okay.
No, no spoilers for it, but which tools were you using?
Audacity.
Okay.
Cool.
So, yeah.
That is not a lot to say, but, you know, 10 minutes little show to about what I did,
just in case it would be helpful to anybody.
I probably would.
I, you know, when I'm doing my recordings, I always find filtering out the background
noise to be, uh, touchy thing.
And, and so, yeah, any tricks I'd love to hear about that.
We could do it though.
Do it all sorts of stuff on this subject, actually.
I'm sure people have experiences that, that could be shared, um, which would be useful.
It was interesting that you had a Sion series five.
I would genuinely have paid a lot of money for one of those.
Haha.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I, we had them at work.
My boss for some reason or other decided that we all ought to, ought to have one.
Um, so we could really know, try them to meetings and that type of thing.
It's a great, great device.
Uh, keyboard.
The whole design of the thing was fascinating.
I really would love just a something raspberry pi powered type, you know, device with a keyboard
like that on the screen, big enough, big enough to play movies.
You know, it's essentially a form with a flip out keyboard.
How difficult to be know it is.
Yeah.
It's just not weather.
Where the money is, I guess.
No comments on that episode, Dave.
We have a world with a big waffle, I guess.
I think that people are probably backlogged with their shows.
Or that are there, uh, couldn't understand your thick scotter jacks and toe.
Yeah, mine particularly.
Oh, hi there.
You know, and all of them.
Yeah, the, uh, um, no, it was, I actually sped mine up when I listened back to it.
And it did the normal cause of events.
And I was having slight difficulty catching everything.
So, uh, it's really doesn't gain death.
But yeah, it, uh, yeah, it was just a fun, fun chat really.
We'll do another one in the in a month or two, I guess.
See, uh, see if we, we have millions of things to talk about.
Mr. X is, um, podcast playing thing for, for one, of course.
So the following day, we had introduction to advent of code by Daniel Pearson's.
And I didn't even know this thing existed.
No, neither did I.
This was, this, this sounded fun.
Sounded like I was, uh, it was like, oh man, I'm missing out this year.
I didn't know that they were doing this.
Yeah, I should have told us about this a month ago.
Oh well.
Well, yeah, absolutely.
Yes.
I think I'd have been stuck quite soon with it, but it would still be worth, uh, worth a shot.
Yeah, I do follow a few other advent calendars.
The, I have to admit that I do still follow the pearl one.
And, uh, it's not, it's not a quiz, but it's, it's lots of, uh, little ideas for,
uh, doing tricky things, uh, throughout the, the advent period.
And, and it's a fascinating source of information.
I think there's one on them as well.
Really?
Yeah, last year, I'm not sure if it's been running this year.
I'm totally missing out.
I have no idea that there were, I didn't know this one existed.
I didn't know that this was a thing that, that there are all these different countdowns
to Christmas with involving, uh, geeky subjects.
That's pretty cool.
There's probably others as well.
If you went to look, you know, and they stay around, uh, forever effectively.
So you can go back and look at the, the 2018 pearl one, for example.
And I'm not sure if there's Python and Ruby and those sorts of languages that may well be,
uh, worth, worth going to, to double check, because it'd be fun to, to, uh, to read through them after the event.
Yeah, definitely.
Wow.
Okay.
And congratulations.
Now we've got something else for me to get lost in on the internet for the next couple
days.
Great.
Oh, the internet is fun.
The show's all about.
Yeah.
But really, the puzzles that, that they were doing sounded, definitely sounded, in this episode,
definitely sounded fun.
And I like the way they were themed.
And there, there was just, uh, uh, yeah.
Just gonna have to somehow make a mental note to watch out for it around next year.
Yeah.
I need to find that.
Assume that the, the, the, the last one is still available.
I was going to find it.
Okay.
The, uh, following day we had, uh, the second part of my build's, uh, setting up a guitar,
which I found interesting.
And he has commented on the show because, hey, editing.
I guess audio editing is a lot like proof reading text to me.
I need to step away from it for a while or else I read right through my mistakes, reading
what I meant, not what I wrote.
When I mentioned SRV and putting heavy strings on an old, uh, uh, telly, breaking the note,
they were a set of 12s.
I kept saying 10s.
10s are usually run on the solo ball of guitars.
I sometimes put 11s on hollow semi-hallow type electrics.
You won't hurt your guitar going from 9 to 10s, but 9s to 12s is a bit of a jump.
By the way, I then end up putting 10s on this telly.
I also pulled a bit more of the relief out of the neck.
Then checked the, you know, intonation again after I've been playing the guitar playing
the guitar ever since.
I'm not sure how quick I'll be to give it away now.
It's playing sweet.
Wow.
So that is a result there from that episode.
Yeah.
I, yeah, I wasn't really up to speed with, with what he was doing there.
But I had a chat with my son who recently bought a, uh, a electric guitar.
He's a, he's a classical guitar player from his degree.
But, um, and he was saying, oh, no, I would never do that myself.
I already sent mine away to get somebody a professional person to do it, you know.
But, uh, say, from his point of view, and what Bill was doing was very impressive.
And so, uh, yeah, I followed, followed his, his view on this.
Yeah, I'm, I'm also coincidentally have a, uh, a son who plays, uh, guitar and was,
but he's definitely on the younger end.
And while he, he recently got a Christmas present of a book about, uh, guitars, including,
that had chapters on how to make and, uh, and tune some of these things aspects of it.
And it was, it was just interesting to see how these sort of harmonized, how the, you know,
it's like, oh, I've heard this before.
I've seen, I've read this before.
Um, well, no, I've heard it because now I've heard it from, you know, uh, heard it on the podcast.
Uh, how these things sort of sus out.
Um, I actually had some sense of what it was actually talking about.
Uh, so they've been reinforcing each other.
But I'm still definitely, you know, just sort of, it's like, uh, the hearing, the, the,
the lingo and the descriptions to me is still sort of like listening to, uh, the Haskell
podcasts and going, okay, now how, uh, what does this mean again?
Okay, I have to go back and look it up.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, very much so.
Yeah, yeah.
I do follow a guy on, uh, YouTube, uh, woodworker who, uh, does make his own guitars,
which he sells or gives away or whatever.
And he's, he's been challenging himself to make guitars out of all sorts of bizarre things,
you know, like a hollow cord door, for example.
Um, and, you know, the sorts that just full of, full of things were like egg boxes and there
are sorts of things.
So you, you, you do get a little bit of an insight into what's, what's involved there.
Um, but, uh, yeah, I would never want to take on a thing like, uh, thing that, and what
I was doing.
So the following day, we had simple screen recorder and big cutter by myself.
Two little useful tools that I come across on that cause I would share them with.
Very nice, very helpful.
Um, I liked, uh, I liked the description and it sounded exactly the kind of simple tools
that I'd, I'd want to use.
I, I am curious, what are you using it for?
Um, you didn't really mention just off.
You want to record your screen, but what are you, what are you, uh, what are you doing with this?
Yes.
Everything?
No, no, there was a particular need that I needed it for.
Ah, okay.
Okay.
Well, I'll leave it at that then.
Yes, exactly.
I must admit, I've, I've thought about doing screen recording for HBR shows, but then
the end result is a, is a video, isn't it?
So, so that doesn't really sort of fit in with the, the HPR, I think, all that much.
But if I was going to do that, I would use something like this.
I think they, the thing to do there will be separate to these tools will be to have a,
to record the show first.
And then do they do the editing after the audio would have to lead.
I think a lot of people when they're doing the movies, lead with the audio anyone,
and then the video samples follow after it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could be an interesting thing.
Sorry.
I would be interesting to try.
Yeah, go ahead.
So the simple screen recorder is for, you know, anything that you're, that's on the screen,
you just want to make a recording of, for example, if you're on a web page,
and it's not the application, it's not behaving the way you expect it to be,
if you can just make a recording.
And then the big cutter thing is just, you know, when you have a, when you take a screen shot,
and you just want to crop it or rotate it or something, big cutter is just that it chaps off the
eye frames at the nearest eye frame.
And then chunks it together and it doesn't reencode or anything.
It just reorders the video frames.
It's very, very basic, but nice little too.
I, yeah, I've recently been going through all my them plugins because I have lots.
And I was, and they've just been thrown in.
It's just sort of a bundle of stuff.
And I think there, there's potential for them to collide with one another.
So I've been going through them.
And as I was doing, I was thinking, oh, people might be interested in how you would use this thing
where you can do stuff like take a word, take a sentence, take a paragraph,
and put things around it.
But to describe such things really hard without something visual.
So, you know, those sorts of contexts where a video of what the editor can do,
it might be, might be quite interesting, but I don't know.
I tried and failed at doing them in episodes.
So I don't know if I want to do that.
I wouldn't say failed.
Come on.
Well, I ran out of steam, let's put it that way.
Fair enough.
Fair enough on that.
It's so much to talk about that.
But yeah.
Yeah, but I definitely agree with the struggle on the one hand.
You know, there's, you're right, there are sometimes where it would just, you know,
it would be just nice to show a snippet or, you know, just a, even with command line things,
just to be able to, you know, see what is happening as you were, you know,
as you were doing X, Y, and Z.
But on the other hand, you know, it's, it's a podcast, it's audio, you know, you want, you know,
if somebody riding in the car is going to go, well, I can't see this.
So, you know.
Yeah.
Next.
And also we have a lot of visually impaired people who get very annoyed with us.
Well, well, that's true, too.
Yeah.
So, maybe a supplementary of some video to say, you know, if you wish you could go and look
at it in there and you have the capability, you could, you could look at it here.
But I'm going to try and describe it to you.
Something like that.
There are some shows that definitely would benefit from it.
And the one that springs to mind is tattoos, overview of how to use Git with a post-it note.
He, I visualized it in my head as he was doing that show, but that will be a very good one
to have just tattoos show playing in the background.
And then somebody physically doing what tattoo is suggesting with a post-it notes and writing
head on it and then putting it over and then putting them on the board and taking them down
and doing what he is suggesting to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Yes.
Those sorts of things could be, could enhance stuff quite a lot, I think.
So, yeah.
Something to think about.
So, let's move on.
And the final in the episode of PipeBaseCAD, cold was part four.
So, this is the last few bits and bobs in relation to that.
And the next day we had episode three, Life of a Commodore.
Life after Commodore was the presentation by Dr. Richard Emmerer's, the author of Inside Commodore DOS.
And this was very interesting, many levels, just a presentation together.
Yeah.
I found the color and the history of the time as interesting as he was describing it as interesting
as the main talk subject matter, I guess, you know, as in who owned rights to what?
Oh, this person was, you know, over here because of the Vietnam War,
it was fun to listen to.
Yeah.
That sort of history is always fascinating.
I assume you can look back at it from a moderate distance and not be too involved with it, I guess.
Yeah.
This is a great series.
I've been doing this a lot.
Is this the last one in the series?
Or is he going to do more, do you know?
No, there's quite a few more stretching out.
I think there's another three or four, perhaps, I'm not sure.
Oh, okay.
I hadn't looked at the feed.
Huh, great.
But it was the last one for this month.
This year and this century or that century.
No, not so many decades.
I think you mean decade.
Yeah.
Thank you.
So what's next, Dave?
Common stuff we didn't.
That were outside of the scope.
Yes.
Yes.
So a comment came in last month just as we were doing the show that we didn't actually read.
Okay.
Do you want to do that?
So, yeah, sorry.
I'm getting a slight coffee.
So, yes.
It was a comment to hookers show about liver office, calc financial functions and stuff.
And it originally come from Tim Timmy, who said that he used it all the time.
And this is a hooker replying saying, I'm really glad you found this useful.
A fact not widely known in these parts is that I was once a financial manager.
So, I think my own experience factored into this.
I love that these tutorials are still useful for people.
And that is an excellent series.
I still refer back to it when I'm reporting a topic again.
That was a refresh.
Yeah, I know I grabbed all of the examples and that sort of stuff and have them stashed away
in my liver office directory and stuff.
So, yeah.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Definitely, definitely.
And yet again, an example kind of which always point out how, you know, you can never judge the impact of a show right away.
It may be much later before somebody says, oh, wow.
That's awesome.
And it really helps.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, we have.
2014 that episode was back.
Yeah.
We have some other comments to that were sent in this month to older, older shows.
So, shall I do this one?
Because since I'm talking about.
Oh, this is actually you, Gabriel, did you want to read it?
Oh, no, since I'm not looking at it.
You're not looking at the notes.
Sorry.
Okay, that's fine.
Yeah.
So, the future reference, the notes are always added to the show that's coming up on Monday.
So, to make it really easy to find, but now it's not the time.
So, yeah, this was a comment on John Culp's show 2924 about hacking and alarm clock to make it quieter.
And it was from Gabriel who said fun to listen to as always.
Nice show.
Your DIY segments remind me that we don't have to accept things as they are.
And don't have to be afraid of trying to make them better.
Thanks for the great show.
Yep.
That says it all.
I love those.
Yeah, John's quite a man of parts, isn't he?
You think he would be sort of a super academic, but he's prepared to turn his hand to just
wear everything.
Just note my info.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
There are a lot of the devices in the swirls that have got beeping mechanisms.
I wouldn't mind putting a resistor on.
Yes.
It would be a prerequisite for any child toy for children under the age of eight, I think.
There should be a potentiometer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not really all these comments are yours.
So, the next one is on start.
Start with the RPG play part 10.
High lost and brown.
So, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoy listening to the series.
I'm a long time RPG player.
I didn't know that, but can say I've ever done a space opera game.
This was really more due to the lack of friends with similar interests than the lack of interest
in my part.
Well, that land lack of hours.
Well, that land lack of hours in the day.
Gabby, what sort of comment is this?
I have no idea now.
You're doing this on purpose.
I was thinking.
It was fun to listen to and at times want to yell to the speakers, no, no, don't do this,
which I agree.
I've also done that.
Oh, yeah.
It is a few rules suggestions.
I like you.
Enjoy systems that can get out of the way.
They can get out of the way of storytelling though.
I still like some crunch to them.
Anyway, thanks for the great the chance to listen to another foray into the starter of the universe.
Yeah.
I just I enjoyed the whole process from the standpoint of hey, it was like getting another
free peep into one of his audiobooks at some level.
But yeah.
And little tip, guys, if you go on to pitch on and throw him a dollar a month, you will get
access to voice from the void, which is got a series on different aspects of the starter
of the universe, how the money works, how the different factions work, how space engines work,
how different the super materials work.
It is absolutely and totally awesome.
Well worth 12 bucks a year.
Go do it.
Go do it now.
That's awesome.
I didn't even know that was there.
Cool.
Oh, it's classic.
Oh, got it.
Okay.
Another thing on my list now.
Dave.
We have a comment on HBR 2942 wire, love lists by Neil Azo, a new host.
It's from Gabriel, even by who says great first episode, fantastic first episode.
Delivery definitely didn't sound wooden.
I love the list family as well.
But this episode was first time I've heard someone talk about the unique power of repels in
the development environment.
My edges have always been very basic and never had the interpreters, had the interpreters embedded.
I may have been missing out all this time.
So thanks for showing something new to try out.
And a repel is a read execute, run something else.
You tell us what that stands for.
Yeah, read something loop.
I forget what the P is, but it's the idea that you write the code and then you run it immediately
afterwards as read eval print, read eval print loop.
That's what it is.
Because the print is putting out the output.
Yeah.
It's the same as in Python and a few other languages, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of the languages definitely have interactive environments.
But what this episode was showing was saying was that when development environments,
sort of, and the language itself, sort of support, you know, modifying the code on the fly,
as you're developing it and seeing the output live and interactive,
it changes the way you do the development.
And that's just something I'd never, you know, heard or heard or tried playing with at that level.
So just more stuck in a traditional OK edit it.
OK, now ready to compile now to now, now see what I did.
So I'm, yeah, that's what what prompted the comment.
I'm wondering I, you know, what I've been missing out on on this time.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, good point.
Good point.
Do you want me to do the next one?
2944.
This was Gabriel's show.
Since it was a conversation.
He and I were having.
So this is Gabriel show on.
Basic part for network flows and connections.
And I said I've been playing around with the things that he'd prepared in the light in that show.
And it was having great fun watching what was going on on my network.
And Gabriel says glad you liked it.
Hey Dave, I've been behind in my listening to glad you liked the scripts and thanks for the feedback.
Yep, kind of weird.
Thank you that I wrote read back to me by the person I was thinking.
But yeah, anyways, thank you for the feedback.
Under the fun.
Yes.
That's great.
OK.
Now might be Mike.
How to show on the Mimble Wimble protocol and Gabriel.
Is it Gabriel or Gabriel?
I guess it's.
It's.
Gabriel.
Yeah, Gabriel.
Gabriel.
Yeah.
I just wanted to comment that I'm definitely learning a lot from this series while you shown that there's a lot of detail to cover.
You're doing it out in nice measures.
Thanks.
Thank you.
But please.
Cool.
Cool.
And the last one of this batch is 2955 machine learning data analysis basics by Daniel person.
Jerry Kaye says great, clear and informational.
Hi, Daniel.
Many thanks for a great episode.
I've been dabbling in numerical analysis in Python for a few weeks.
I think this is an area I would like to explore next.
We'll check out your YouTube for sure, regards Jerry.
Um, but this is for the comments.
Yes.
All comments.
The peak comments.
And then the thing I'm not looking forward to.
The list discussions.
Yeah.
So, uh, let's start with the nice ones first.
Um, so Paul quirks since the heads up that he pulled.
He did their wrong into an outro podcast music, but that's fine.
So the next one I will read verbatim from me to the mailing list.
Hi, all I have had disturbing reports that multiple hosts have been harassed after posting shows to HPR.
After further investigation, I have no reason to doubt that these reports are anything but genuine.
This has been a bit of a shock to me as HPR has always seemed like a well regulated community.
I for one don't condone harassment or offensive behavior, especially against people who have met an effort to contribute to the network.
I believe that this is the view of the HPR community in general, but I would like your confirmation.
Therefore, I would like to propose the following policy change to modify the above page, which I read here.
There are hacker public radio is dedicating to the sharing knowledge to hacker public radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge in a welcoming community that offers positive feedback.
And encourages respectful debate. I would appreciate your active response on this issue.
Thankfully, a lot of people have commented on the thread, none of whom have...
Well, it came as a surprise to basically everybody, but I have to assume that these issues are genuine.
I have no reason to doubt them as far as the person who reported them was concerned that they were happening after the people posted shows.
It happened to multiple holes and it happened on IRC and there have been harassed an IRC and there have been harassed an email.
And he has seen some of the comments and they were pretty bio.
Now, I asked him to put the filler out for anybody who this has happened to and that they would contact me.
Nobody has done so as yes, but as we mentioned earlier, people may be a little bit behind in their podcast listening.
There have been a lot of responses.
The one thing that I would like to mention is that this is not a code of contact in the typical sense, largely because we are...
HPR is, in essence, an upload mechanism. It's an RSS feed. There is no...
We don't look at the shows. We don't have any control over the shows. We don't know what...
We don't know who the hosts are, other than an anonymous mail-less and even that.
We have facility for people to drop in the shows. I do not know who is in the HPR community.
I just found out John Colp has what John Colp looks like after many years.
Many of my good friends, I didn't even know their real names until they passed away.
So, HPR as a community is quite large, but I will say that the reason for the...
We're requesting the policy change is that it encourages...
It allows the janitors, Dave and I and everybody else to go, well, you know, that's not what we're about here at HPR.
We're about getting more shows. We're about sharing.
That's why the HPR, this show that you're listening to now, why I started...
I proposed this many years ago when I took over the mantle here as the shepherd of HPR.
I didn't feel that the hosts were getting enough feedback on the show that people were enjoying the shows.
And people today, especially Gabrielle, Gabrielle.
I'm going to call you, either Gabrielle or Gabrielle.
So, be prepared first. I put your people's names. That's no problem.
I hope you don't feel...
I'm not taking any offense or harassment from this cup.
From the hosts, don't worry.
And I also appreciate that perhaps I have annoyed people or I have come across as...
Maybe I've done something and if that's the case, please contact Dave.
And if you're not happy with anybody inside the HPR community, then please contact some other podcasters.
And they can get in touch with us and we can try and make it better.
So, this is long story short. I don't feel this is a code of conduct because I...
We can't enforce it. There's no way we can say, yeah, we can't enforce this.
But what we can do is you can disassociate ourselves from it and say, well, that's not what we're about here.
And make other people make other podcasters aware that, look, that's not what we're about over here.
The majority of people over here are not about that.
And we also don't think that's cool.
And if we're make it, if we happen to be in those same IRC channels that we talk, say,
dude, you're not representing HPR here. Let's be very clear about that.
Okay. Is that enough about that?
Well, that's all I have to say about that, I think.
I think that's perfectly reasonable. It's certainly...
I think that based on the email responses on the mailing list there,
that I think there was pretty wide consensus for everything you just said.
So, I just hope that as a community, we continue to...
Do you know how to speak up and encourage most of all, right?
And especially when we see people being knocked down.
I hadn't seen any of this yet and personally.
But if I do, I hope I have the gumption to stand up and say,
look, guys, this isn't cool. This isn't what this is about.
And it goes for any of our contributors and listeners.
Yeah, I would agree with that very much and agree with what Ken was saying.
I mean, my view has been that HPR has been all along a supportive environment.
And I mean, I joined it looking for like-minded people and found them and found them incredibly supportive, you know?
So, that seems to me to be the way it is and the way it should continue to be.
So, any deviation from that should be, should be, should be dissuaded as strongly as possible.
I mean, we have a history here.
You know, there have been disagreements on different concepts, ideas or whatnot.
And most of that has been handled as far as I can tell all of it's been handled.
But I guess it's now most, you know, with constructive, you know,
somebody posting a show and saying, well, you know, I don't, I think it's this.
And, you know, nobody, I've been impressed at, you know, disagreements, though there were,
that nobody's ever taken it personally or had a reason to.
So, it's just disappointing to hear that it sounds like somebody's just going out there to troll other people
and I can't fathom why or maybe I just don't want to, but it's just really sad to hear.
And apparently there were more than one person doing this.
Yep. Anywho.
Yeah. I would just like if there are people who, there are things that we can do as a community to basically,
well, to stop it, we could modify the email address that's always an option.
And we can always give you an alias. We can monitor that email address for you.
We can do that sort of stuff. But if these guys are girls or whoever are chasing you down on IRC and real life,
like that's just, you know, it's just extremely uncool.
Also, because it stops people contributing more shows to HPR, which is clearly the number one sin.
Can you imagine like all the encouragement that we do to try and get people to step up to the plate
and press that record button and how hard that is to submit a show the first time, to send it into us.
And we have people who spend good money.
We have Josh Nap, who's there paying for the hosting for this thing out of his pocket because he believes this.
You got the rest of us paying for domains and servers and mobile servers and stuff paying for all the people who paid for swag conferences.
The people who give up their time to go to conferences, the people who give up their time to respond to people's emails and have polite discussions on the mailing thread.
And to find that somebody would consider that HPR, this sort of stuff is what HPR is about, is just irritating to me.
Just waste that, for starters, rude. Yeah, it's not cool. But for secondly,
go to all this trouble to encourage people to submit shows and then when people do, other people are criticizing them.
Good.
Alrighty. Anything else on the docket there, Dave?
There was another male, a little bit of male discussion, which was
Paul Quirk commenting on the Fediverse show from Hooker.
So he's on Macedon and said, here I am and come and follow me and all that sort of stuff, which seemed to me a very good idea.
So I certainly following Paul on Macedon myself.
No, I need to do that. We should put in the social media stuff on the host profile in the following some time as well.
That's another thing. Also, Foster has come up and we have a table and now I'm really, you know, it's in January and we kind of really need to get stuff going.
I do not have any swag or anything that needs to be organized this week. Does anybody have any editing skills to take
graphics of free open source podcasts, floss podcasting?
Anyone got any ideas or can put it a logo together or something together for this because I need to get a banner.
People, anybody, anybody, beauty, beauty?
Well, that's definitely not me, but I hope somebody listening says, oh yeah, that is me.
Yes, that needs to go to the mailing list today.
Yes, I was fully supported, but I don't think I could contribute or anything useful.
Okay, so that was all very pleasant waste of time.
Do we have anything coming up on the LWN calendar? Yes, we do. We have Colonel Minicom in February. We have Foster M.
That's the most important one.
How are the tags doing, Dave?
Well, the tags got no attention in December, sadly, but they just got some added today, just because I relax.
I've done any of these ranges. I'll just do some today, but they miss the boats, whereas the show is concerned.
I saw somebody on the IRC gone back listening to all the shows from the beginning and I asked them to do the tags and they said, I think it was raised.
It was raised on the new year's show, actually. I think I'm not sure who it was. I just noticed it in the either pad notes.
Somebody said, we need, we need tags, we're missing tags on some of the, some of the older shows.
That was, thank you very much. I'll find out.
But yeah, we're always in need.
What's the general sense of skill? How many, how many are there yet to be covered?
What funny should I ask that? There are 575 shows without tags.
Without summaries, 543 without tags, 493 would need their summaries and their tags and 625 would need a little bit of work.
Need a little bit of work?
That was just by some of the other ones.
It's just a sum of the other ones.
So the then diagram of summaries without summaries and that of without tags overlap.
So the overlap is 625, I guess.
This needs updates that will be updated shortly.
Adding in the four or whatever it was, I just added early on today.
Yeah. So yeah, we're getting closer and closer.
We'll be up to 3,000 shows before many days are out.
And we've only got this relatively small number without these features.
So the problem is becoming more and more manageable, smaller and smaller as time goes on.
I also have zero ideas for episode three thousand zero none.
I'm all out of ideas after all the celebrations that we've done.
So anyone has any idea on how to mark episode three thousand, please share it with the community that will be awesome or not.
Just contact us and we'll post the show.
And if you wanted to be a surprise, we can we can post it on the day.
I have no code to myself.
I'm not good at these things.
Yeah, no, no quality ideas anyways.
A lot of stupid ones.
I'll brainstorm.
Except stupid ones.
One word snapped from each episode.
Oh, if you could do that, that would be an awful lot of work.
Just going back and trying to get the web file of every person who's been on the show.
Yeah, that would be some people to introduce themselves.
It's pretty hard to do, but yeah.
Yes, I have done that already and that took me days upon days upon days.
Okay, well, that brings us to the end of this show.
Hope it wasn't too depressing.
And if anyone has comments on this show or anything else that we've discussed.
As I explained in the above page, we are the janitors, the policies and all that sort of stuff is done on mailing list.
So join the mailing list, post your comment and let's hear about it and discuss it.
So, anyway, that's it.
Tune in tomorrow, tomorrow, even, for another exciting episode of Hacker.
Public Radio.
