Alright, and the dude is back here with wrestling as you like it.
Episode 3.
Now today, now I know that the last episode I said
I was going to talk about into the fire
from the National Wrestling Alliance,
which I will a little bit, but not really reporting
the results of like the matches and everything
or everything that's been going on through the National Wrestling Alliance
or Capitol Wrestling since this is the two permissions that I follow.
It seems that the crowd here,
which in professional wrestling you play off the crowd,
so might as well use that in podcasting.
It seems that people are more interested in
talking about the intricacies of
progressing like kind of how it works,
which I can sort of do.
I can't do in depth in depth because I mean,
I'm not a professional wrestler, I am a
would be journalist, but
but I could do my best since I am a fan
and I do understand some of it.
So to tie in into the fire,
we are going to talk about supercards
and the roles of supercards
and what exactly are supercards.
Here's a hint.
Paperviews typically are supercards.
All right, so here we're going to talk about what a supercard is.
I'm going to do the Wikipedia definition
if you look up card in sports.
A supercard consists of a title match,
combat sport event,
which comprises of high level matches
and or special attractions.
Supercards serve as a focal point
of professional wrestling promotions
and can function as a primary source of revenue for such promotions.
A good example of,
now this is just me talking,
I'm done with the Wikipedia thing.
A best example of a wrestling supercard
is obviously WrestleMania.
It is the biggest wrestling supercard
out there today.
Other big examples would be New Japan's
Wrestle Kingdom.
Obviously beforehand,
like I said with the National Wrestling Alliance,
obviously that would have been into the fire
and what's coming up is hard times.
And also,
Capital Wrestling,
despite only having monthly shows,
actually does have special supercards,
such as the last stop,
which they do with other promotions.
And they did have like a paperview,
I think in Knoxville or somewhere around there,
need to be more prepared with these things.
But anyway,
the function of a supercard,
well obviously it's to draw revenue
for the wrestling promotion
by having like, you know,
the best matches possible,
but it also serves as a very,
very big focal point for the storytelling
that is in pro wrestling.
It is essentially the season finale,
although there would be like multiple seasons
in a year since a lot of wrestling promotions
have more than a yearly paperview
or a yearly supercard.
But pretty much what a supercard
serves as, like I said,
is pretty much a climactic point to a feud,
whether it be ending a feud
or starting a feud,
or it could also be a high point
in a continuation of a long-term feud.
Great examples would be
the numerous WrestleMania's against
Austin versus the Rock,
probably like their first matches
like on a paperview
would be igniting their feud
and also having subsequent
other matches on paperviews
continuing of that feud
and probably having one last match
before either wrestler has retired.
In modern times,
going to talk about Into the Fire,
we have a storyline with James Storm
complaining that the National Wrestling Alliance
has some conspiracy against him
not wanting the world title
and is accusing the champion
of being a coward
and essentially not facing him.
Well, they finally have the match
into Into the Fire
and Nick Aldous wins
by dubious instances
leading credit to
there is a conspiracy.
I'll end in the next episode of NWA Power
if you feel that there is
and that Nick Aldous cheated to win
and is now a heel.
Beforehand, no one knew
if he was a babyface or a heel
and for those that don't know,
he's a good guy,
heel means bad guy.
And with the National Wrestling Alliance,
at least with the TV show Power,
it's fairly new.
So there's people that are developing
their characters slash gimmicks
and some people you're not sure
if they're babyfaces or heels
but luckily with different events
such as Supercars,
you can actually reveal
somebody's intentions,
whether they're a good guy or a bad guy.
And into the Fire's case,
it definitely showed
leading up that they were turning
Nick Aldous into
definitively a bad guy.
And all the enough,
it kind of double turned.
Now what a double turn is
and I know I kind of went off
on a rail,
but a double turn is something
that's beautiful if done right.
It's when you have two people
they go into a match
as babyface and heel,
and then they switch spots
where the babyface becomes the heel
and the heel becomes the babyface.
Like within that match
and a Supercard is a perfect spot
for that.
Now like I said recently
you had James Storm
who was proven to be right
that he got screwed
out of winning that title
and was getting screwed
of getting shots at that title
since Nick Aldous is a cowardly heel
and a dastardly heel at that.
And on top of that
a perfect example
of the double turn
would be the
hold on, let me look this up.
I'm pretty sure
hold on.
I want to say it was
Survivor Series.
That's WWE
back then it was WWE F
but
hold on,
WWE F.
But anyway,
as I am stalling for time on this
it was between Brett Hart
and Stone Cold Steve Austin.
Steve Austin came in
as the heel
and Brett Hart
came in as the
babyface
and let's see here.
Yeah, I believe it is Survivor Series
that that was the 10th.
Is that the 10th one?
Yeah it was.
Alright, the 10th one.
And pretty much
Brett Hart puts Steve Austin
into the sharpshooter.
And
that is a
submission hold.
And the referee
goes up to Steve Austin
and asks him if he wants
the quit.
Well, Steve Austin
doesn't quit.
He actually passes out
refusing to quit
and with him wanting to fight
on the crowd
he expects him
as being like,
hey, you know,
he's a fighter,
he's tough,
we like this guy.
So they start cheering Austin.
LN after the
Bell's ring,
you know,
to stop the match.
Brett Hart being
frustrated,
kick Steve Austin
while he's like
down and passed out
and
becoming
loathe.
And just the United States
of America.
That's the funny thing
about
heel Brett Hart
was that he was a
heel in the United States
of America.
But like in Canada
and other places
he was a babyface.
Really creative.
And that's why I like
heel Brett Hart
better than
babyface Brett Hart
because there's like a
lot of
more variety to it
as opposed to being
just a guinea-toothed
shoes.
But my
might
have to dress
you have things
like that
or
or
really good
iconic events
such as
I believe it was
crap.
I think it's
WrestleMania
three.
I want to say
WrestleMania
three.
But regardless,
I'm talking about the
slamming of the giant.
Now,
despite what
WWE once
tells you,
Andre the giant
was not
undefeated
and Hulk Hogan was
the first person
to slam him.
And it's also
was at the first time
Hulk Hogan had
slammed Andre the giant.
But this was the
first time
that a worldwide
audience had
seen Andre the giant
lose.
Because last time
that Andre the giant
would lose
or get slammed,
it would be
in like
a local
television market.
Because that's how
wrestling was
in the 70s
was that each
promotion had
their own
territory had
a specific spot
where they
broadcasted.
But with that
WrestleMania,
it was a world
wide event.
And a lot of people
hadn't seen Andre the
giant
lose
or
get slammed
in a single
competition.
And
it's
what drew
and the people
went wild
because they never
saw someone
at that size.
And Andre the giant
lose.
It was
huge back then.
Like in the 70s
when people
slammed him,
like he was a big
guy then.
But he
weighed
a lot
when Hogan finally
did.
Although
it wasn't
while Andre was
at his heaviest.
That would probably
be the
ultimate warrior
that slammed him
while Andre was
at his heaviest.
But Hogan was
pretty damn
close.
And what Hogan
actually said
was that he was
just like
he could
feel the
fernabray in his
back, just like
crack, going
kink, kink, kink, kink,
kink, and
then he finally
slammed him.
But it's
events like that
or the
I think that's
on the same event,
the same
Rassolmania.
You would have
Ricky the
dragon steampot
versus Randy Savage
to the best
wrestlers
in the business and they have pretty much a damn near perfect match and Miss
WWF fans will say like that is the greatest match that was ever in wrestling now
New Japan fans what should say modern New Japan fans would probably say Okaada
versus Kenny Omega and people that watch the MWA or WCW back in like the A's
and something that would say Ricky Steamboat versus Rip Flair but regardless all
those again three matches that I would say were the greatest matches ever all
occurred on super cards so super cards draw in the money because people see
this as pretty much the best matches that you're going to get from this
promotion at this certain point and to do that is with great storytelling like
starting feuds continuing feuds for or an end to a feud and hopefully the
climactic battle that happens the crowd likes and continues people to watch
the TV shows and also go to special live events which are also known as
house shows which are typically not televised but sometimes they end up being
televised or recording but that being said hopefully you guys have a little bit
understanding on what super cards are and how they work and maybe you'll
actually be able to check one out for yourself like I said hard times is coming
up that would be available on the fight network September I forgot to mention
this in September the first super card which would be the CMLL anniversary show
which CMLL is the oldest promotion still going on in the world today which is
a promotion out of Mexico which is the Luchilini style wrestling you know the
wrestlers the masks El Santo Rey Mysterio Jr. Eddie Guerrero would be one of the
legendary Luchidores that have all competed in the various meds of
compression CMLL included but they have their anniversary shows on September
and I keep freaking missing them like I keep it's like I want to buy that pay
review but I keep missing that pay-per-view because I totally forget which day
it's on and those pay-per-views are really cheap and as the longest running
pay-per-view series is their anniversary shows like they're up to like 80
something for like their anniversary shows and it would be amazing to witness
that at least on shall we say on my computer screen or on a TV screen let alone
live but there's that and also the various WrestleMania would be nice although
I would say that WWE with having like their TV programs being long it's made
the pay-per-views longer and sometimes with long supercards and you know
slash long pay-per-views even long TV shows it's hard to keep people's attention
throughout the entire thing and that's kind of bad for a supercard but if the
main event matches are worth it they're worth it
now that being said I'm going to read a comment that I had from the last
year since I finally got a comment this is B Ronaldo that has a topic WWE
because interesting info I remember in the early 90s watching WWE up with my
dad now I know why they changed the name to WWE the Panda won the fight
absolutely and it also that also reminds me of like this internet meme where it
has like two pandas hitting each other with chairs and it says WWF that always
gave me a chuckle but yeah and like I said before I don't know why they didn't
go back to like worldwide wrestling federation and have it WWF whether that
was just too close to worldwide life fund or not who knows but that being said
it's WWE now and that being said keep on listening to the next show I'll try to
bring up some more things to help clarify how wrestling works what I
personally like it and why other people should you know give it a shot
especially since nowadays there isn't really that much of a monopoly I mean
they're kind of is but with the internet you got so many promotions that are
able to distribute their content and you can definitely try to find something
that is your niche for the type of wrestling that you like and it also helps
for all the UK fans well here is that British wrestling has is make it a huge
comeback and the fact that British wrestlers are getting the recognition that
they deserve after a long overdue time is amazing is great for all the women
listeners women's wrestling is definitely in a boom period especially when
WWE the women's matches are more important than the men's matches so finally
women are getting there due to being you know the top of the card for the top of
the event you know the main event since like the 1950s but yeah anyway see you
guys next episode I think next episode with me being a journalist I think I
might actually talk about how wrestling journalism has changed throughout
time and how it's you know the history origins how it started out and the two
key figures because in modern wrestling journalism comes down to two main
people and that is Bill Aptor and Dave Meltzer usually like when it comes to
wrestling journalism it's either Bill Aptor school or Dave Meltzer school
of reporting so I'll definitely cover that and I'll actually be kind of a
little bit of an expert at that since I am going to school for journalism so
therefore this is my forte so anyway see you guys later
