Hello again, this is Tony Hughes for Hacker Public Radio.
This is an auspicious show for me as it's my 50th show that I've recorded and released
on Hacker Public Radio in my own right, however, prior to my first show in my own right,
I did guest on two shows.
The first of these was Hacker Public Radio 0844 and it was entitled The Flying Hamburg, hosted
by HPR volunteers and that was released in October 2011.
This was a show that was recorded at Bar Camp Blackpool in 2011 when a group of us got
together to record a podcast.
The lairiest thing was that the only place we could find to record it was a stairwell
which happened to be next to the toilets, definitely not family friendly, but if you want
to laugh, go and have a listen.
The next show I appeared on was an interview I did with Ken Fallon at my first dog camp
in the same year.
This was Hacker Public Radio 0863 and basically I talked about my journey using free cycle
that got me into using Linux on old PCs and the like that I'd refurbished that I could
then give away back on free cycle.
Ken at the time was as usual trying to recruit new hosts and interviewed me with the hope
that I would become one.
Well it did work but it took me another 5 years before I finally recorded my first show
in my own right.
First just to say the idea for this show comes from HPR 2,700 in which Ken created a script
to automate the bot voice reading a list of every show that has been released on HPR.
So to celebrate my 50th show I thought I would list my shows but with me running through
them and do a brief summary of the shows where appropriate.
So as is usual my first proper show that I did for HPR was HPR 2051 my Linux journey and
in this episode I talked briefly or less than briefly depending on your opinion how I
started my computing journey and ended up using Linux and as I said on that show the
interview that I did with Ken started with free cycle but you know gone listen to this
show and you'll get a fuller update of how I got into using Linux and my Linux story.
My next show was Hacker Bullet Radio 2056 an interview with a young Kafka which was released
on the 20th of June 2016.
I recorded this show with Josh Lowe at all about code at my local Raspberry Jam.
Josh at the time was probably at 12 and he has gone on to develop the edgy box program
which helps people transition from scratch over to full Python so if you want to listen
to that episode that was a great one.
So episode 3 that I recorded was Hacker Bullet Radio 2065 what's in my bag and this was
a basic look at what was in the bags that I carry around when I go to computer events
or just to my local Raspberry Jam or to my makerspace stroke log.
We looked at that show note and the show notes again this is something that I need to update
quite quickly because my bag looks very different today as Kenned say IO in the show.
Episode 4 Hacker Bullet Radio 2076 was about magazines I read and I did a couple of episodes
about this and basically it was just running through some of the technology magazines and some
of the other magazines that I read on a regular basis that also encompassed Hacker Bullet Radio 287
which was my episode 5. My episode 6 Hacker Bullet Radio 2097 was about new toys.
I talked about my hardware journey over the last 30 odd years and talked about a new i7
tower I just bought second hand at the computer option I frequent and I'm often mentioning on shows
so if you want to hear that one that's a good one to listen to.
My episode 7 Hacker Bullet Radio 20101 what's on my podcatcher?
It was a show which says what it was on the tin and it was just about some of the podcasts that
I listened to. Episode 82144 which was quite a large gap for me was a start of a series of
interviews I did at Bar Camp Manchester in 2016 and that first one was another interview with Joshua
when it was a follow-up from the one I've done previously and talking about how the software
project he's developing is progressed. The next couple of shows were also from Bar Camp
Manchester 2151 and 2157 were interview shows. The first one we clear was one of the organizers
and the second one was with Alan O'Donough who basically started the Raspberry Jam movement
although there are some contentions about that but I would create it Alan as one of the
starters of the Raspberry Jam movement. My episode 11 which was Hacker Public Radio 2257
was about installing what OS on a little later aspire one netbook and it was basically just a
review of how well it made the netbook run and made the netbook still relevant today.
Episode 12 was Hacker Public Radio 2265 and it was another review of what OS but this time on
the Lenovo X61S I tried it on that to see how that worked on the Lenovo being quite a powerful
little laptop all being about 12 years old now it was a dual core processor 1.6.
Episode 13 Hacker Public Radio 2271 was a little review of the Raspberry Pi Zero W after
it was released and my episode 14 Hacker Public Radio 2280 was about the Lenovo X61S part 2.
I'd slightly upgraded the hardware by putting a SSD on it and also I'd found that what OS wasn't
quite what I was expecting for that particular laptop and so I was experimenting with another
Linux version which was Linux Lite. Episode 15 Hacker Public Radio 2286 was quite a
poignant one for me it was released in May 2017 following a stroke I'd had the previous
February and it was basically entitled surviving a stroke and it was my experience of surviving the
stroke and some general information about my life since then. My episode 16 which was Hacker Public
Radio 2295 was another Linux review show and it was MX Linux this time but on a bit more powerful
than over X230i I'd had some problems with booting this particular machine with Linux Mint so
an SSD so I tried MX Linux and that seemed to cure the problem that I was having at the time.
I will say that they X230i runs fine on Linux Mint 19.1 so it's no longer an issue.
My episode 17 Hacker Public Radio 2331 was the first of a series of interviews I did at Liverpool
Makefest in 2017. These go through 2336 233 sorry 2341 2346 2352 I could say they were
interview shows that I did at the Makefest go and take a look at them if you're interested in
some of the participants of Liverpool Makefest in 2017. My episode 22 was Hacker Public Radio 2362
and this was putting raspberry in x86 on a Lenovo x61s and how well that ran.
Episode 23 HPR 2366 was the first one of my cooking shows that I've did and this one was about
making bramble jelly after I'd been picking wild brambles locally. The next show at my episode 24
was HPR 2374 and in this cookery based show I talk about how to make sauerkraut in the show notes
I do include pictures of the process so take a look at that if you want to know how to make sauerkraut
and we're halfway we're at my episode 25 which was Hacker Public Radio 2380 and this was running
raspberry in x86 on the p4 tower at the Makeerspace we have a number of old Pentium 4 2.8 gig tower
machines knocking about so I tried putting raspberry in x86 on it and it was actually surprisingly good.
So coming to episode 26 which was Hacker Public Radio 2405 this was a review show of my
new Nokia 6 phone and basically I just reviewed the phone shortly after I purchased it.
Episode 2432 which was my episode 27 was a couple of months later and it was
a entitled living with living with the Nokia 6 and it was an update to the 2405 show.
My episode 28 was Hacker Public Radio 2442 and this was a soundscape show of the
sound of birdsong that I'd recorded at Woodbrook Quaker Study Center in Birmingham in the UK and
this was just a short show about that soundscape it was inspired by another soundscape show that I'd
heard. My episode 29 was Hacker Public Radio 2597 and this was a show about installing a bun
218.04 Matte on a PC just a review show basically about 1 to 1804.
My episode 30 HPR 2590 was a bit of a warning show after I'd blown my PC power supply
and it was just entitled blowing a PC power supply and it was just how not to show
my episode 31 Hacker Public Radio 2595 again I was talking about purchases at my local computer
auction and this time it was about a secondhand to see BuzzZ30 laptop that I just purchased
and a review of that. Episode 32 was HPR 202601 and this was another series of interviews that I'd
done at Liverpool Matefest in 2018. The first one was Chris Dell. My episode 332606 was an
interview with Dan Lynch at the same show. Dan had recently become one of the organizers of Liverpool
Matefest and people all know him from Linux Outlaw fame. Episode 34 was 2612 and this was a
interview with concrete dog about rocketry and that was again at Liverpool Matefest.
My episode 35 HPR 2616 was an interview with Josh all about code again and this was about
his edge of box program which has come on a long way over the years. Episode 36 was Hacker Public
Radio 2621 and this was an interview with Chanel Thomas one of the participants in Liverpool
Matefest 2018 that's a really good show go and take a look at that one. Episode 37 HPR 2626
was another interview at Liverpool Matefest 2018 and this time with Helen and Chris
from We're All Code Club and Manchester Hackspace. My episode 38 was Hacker Public Radio 2632
again with an interview with Robert and Carl from Liverpool Matefest
there from the Edgel University. Episode 39 was Hacker Public Radio 2636 and this was an interview
at Liverpool Matefest with Joel from the J.M.U. Fablab. My episode 40 HPR 2641 was an interview with
Rachel from the Microbit Foundation and this was again recorded at Liverpool Matefest.
Episode 41 was HPR 2646 and this was an interview with Steve and Gerard from the Liverpool
Astronomical Society recorded at Matefest 2018. Episode 42 was HPR 2652 and this was the final
in the series of Liverpool Matefest interviews and this was an interview with Caroline and John
from Matefest. Caroline Keep is one of the founding members of the Matefest in Liverpool and she
was talking about the school where she works with John Carling who's her head teacher. Episode 43 HPR 2663
it was a review show on a piece of hardware I just purchased two and a half inch SSD
stroke HDD caddy off eBay and I was doing a quick review because I think the show Q was a little
bit light at the time. My episode 44 was HPR 2702 and this was a show in response to
episode Hacker Public Radio Episode 2658 and basically it was a response to Dave and
our show about Audacity and their post production of podcasts which was a really good show so if
you're looking for some information on using Audacity for producing podcasts go and take a look at
that. My episode 45 was HPR 2735 and this is another cooking show in which I talk about
Civito and this is a base for stews and sauces and stuff so take a look at that if you're
interested in cookery. Episode 46 is the first of a couple of shows I did on applications
that I use on Linux and this is Hacker Public Radio Show 2738 2746 and 2772 are the follow-up shows
to this talking about the software and the applications I use on Linux. So my final show before
this show which is my episode 49 Hacker Public Radio 2786 is a show that was inspired by Anuka
doing a show on his YouTube channels that he listens to, oh he watches so I decided to run
through some of the channels that I subscribe to and just give a short to review of each of those.
And that brings us up to date with this being the 50th episode which has been a short run through
of the shows that I've recorded for HPR over the last few years. So I hope you've enjoyed
reminiscing as much of I've enjoyed recording the show and reminiscing about some of the things
I've recorded over the last three years and this is Tony Hughes for Hacker Public Radio signing off
for now. Tera.
