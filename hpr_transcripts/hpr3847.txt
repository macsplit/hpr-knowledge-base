This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3847 for Tuesday 2 May 2023.
Today's show is entitled, all about synchrotrons.
It is hosted by Clinton Roy and is about one minute long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, beginning of a series on synchrotrons.
Hello.
My name is Clinton.
A few years ago I moved cities to start a new job at the Australian Synchrotron.
I've been there for four years now and while I am still a software engineer
and I will never be fully on top of all of the science aspects of the synchrotron,
I do feel that I have enough knowledge now that I could probably do a series of podcasts on the synchrotron.
So I'm going to aim to release one episode a month covering some aspect of the synchrotron.
If anyone has any questions about what I'm going on about,
let me know and I will record another episode answering those questions.
Thank you very much.
