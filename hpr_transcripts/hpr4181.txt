This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4181 from Monday the 12th of August 2024.
Today's show is entitled, Downloading Out of Copyright Movies.
It is the first show by Newhost Bob and is about two minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Using Tour Proxy with Whitey Dash to LP to get public domain movies.
I'm using text-to-speech as suggested by Beza in Episode HBR 4167, removing another obstacle
to recording an HBR show.
I prefer to use Piper as suggested by Archer 72 in HBR 4172.
For this tutorial, I suggest how it might be possible to use Tor browser to download
difficult to find public domain works.
You can find which movie you are allowed to download using Wikipedia.
The article is a list of films in the public domain in the United States.
I found out about this list after reading the article Copyright in Zombies, Vampires,
Frankenstein, and more.
As an example, The Night of the Living Dead released in 1968, immediately came out of copyright
due to missing copyright notice and errors from the distributor.
You can browse the list until you find the movie you want to watch.
Next double-check that that version is legal to download in your jurisdiction.
You could then open the Tor browser and do a Duck Duck Go video search.
In our hypothetical example, say you found the video on the site ok dot are you forward
search video, forward search 1 2 3 4.
You could use whitey-dlp to download it via the command line.
whitey-dlp is a feature rich command line audio and video downloader.
You just type whitey-dlp followed by the URL to download the movie.
As well as letting you browse privately, Tor also enables a socks proxy which other applications
can use.
That way your home IP address is not recorded.
You just add dash dash proxy option and point it to the Tor port of 9,150.
An example is in the show notes for this episode.
I am in no way condoning the downloading of legal material and in not suggesting in
any way that you do so.
