This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4102 for Tuesday the 23rd of April 2024.
Today's show is entitled, regarding Hacker Public Radio 3133 more MPV quick tips.
It is hosted by Archer 72 and is about 5 minutes long. It carries a clean flag.
The summary is Archer 72 chats about capture of extensive MPV history.
Hello HBR, this is your host Archer 72 for another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
My subject today is I have a few tips to use with the MPV media player, which is a continuation of HBR 3133,
quick tip using MPV with YouTube links, where I give a quick tip on shortcut keys for watching YouTube or other video sites in MPV.
First of all, I seem to have a LUA script for the MPV media player that I cannot find a place to give a tribusion to.
I believe that it was found on GitHub on the just part of the website.
The script is to be placed in the slash home slash user slash.config slash MPV slash script slash directory,
and made executable with CH mod plus tech success of history with titles.luo.
The resulting file whenever you play a video, audio or YouTube file and MPV is a text file named history with titles.dxt,
an example of what I have in my history is here.
