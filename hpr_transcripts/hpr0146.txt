Thank you.
I am my own key!
As you go, you're drunk, and if you see all of your thoughts,
Is it safe at all? What if you lose it at all?
Is it my motive, facing thoughts that stay with me?
They'll just pass in there, or it'll open for your share.
It is hard to steal, and prepidate a lock and seal,
When you travel soon, over the closure of a deal.
Nobody breaks it, it just breaks the wall.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Now the time is here, for working is most secure.
Sidebars on the track, make sure data's safe inside.
Nobody breaks it, it just breaks the wall.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
Cracking encryption, that will take too long.
