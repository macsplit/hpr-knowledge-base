This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4151 from Monday the 12th of February 2024.
Today's show is entitled MSI Gunner or Review.
It is hosted by Kebi and is about 22 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is a review of the Gunner or PC case by MSI.
Hello, hello, welcome to an episode of HPR.
I'm Kebi, I'm one of the co-hosts of the podcast Talks Jam and I haven't actually done
an HPR episode in quite a while.
So I thought, yeah, it's about time I actually got around to doing it again.
This one is going to focus on my review of the MSI MPG Gunner 110R PC case.
Now it was in the market for a new PC case as my old one was still usable, was 15 years
old.
I had kept the internal components updated but I'd never needed to update the case until recently
because I noticed that it had two LED bars in the front of the case, those had stopped
working, not particularly a big issue for me.
But the fans inside the case itself had gone quite a bit louder and I hadn't actually
replaced them since I picked them in.
So I thought, well, it's probably time to treat myself to a new case rather than starting
to replace all the fans and start fiddling about on LED lighting on a 15-year old case.
So after looking at what's available, I read some reviews and decided that the MSI Gunner 110R
was fine for what I needed at a very reasonable price of £90.
This was a bit beyond the basic budget price but if I had more expendable income then
I certainly could have spent way more so that this actually suited my budget fine.
So the overall dimensions of this case now I'll apologise if you can't work with a
matrix system but I'm using millimetres here, all sizes and millimetres.
So if you don't have units installed that's my recommendation for a great conversion
app, units on Android.
So check it out, Netthroid.
The case in length wise it's 440mm long, it's 220mm wide and stands off the desk or
off the floor depending where you've got it at 485mm.
It's an ATX case with the space and spacers for other size motherboards.
In terms of usable internal size for those who are gamers and use very high end graphics
card, the clearance in length is about 325mm so please ensure that's big enough for your
card.
Although in saying that if your card's bigger than that then being perfectly honest you're
probably not looking at a case in this price range, you're probably wanting something
a bit higher end.
It has 7 PCI slots and these are screwed on, they can be removed and not broken off in
the old style fashion so the good thing is you can also replace them as long as you remember
where you put them and you don't end up with that extra big large vent that you used
to have if you ever decided you no longer needed a PCI card.
There are 3 fans located at the front and in old money this is where your optical drives
and hard disks used to be stored and there's also one at the back end of the case.
All of these are RGB lit and they act in coordination, there is no space at all to fit
any optical drive so if this is something that you require then straight out this is
not the case for you.
There are 2 removable drivebays located behind the motherboard.
You need to take off the panel to actually get to these and there are 2 slots that screw
in the individual 2.5 drives, again these are stored vertically.
The 2 slot parts that are there they can accommodate a full size 3.5 drives and what actually
I found handy was I had adapters already to double up the 2.5 drives so you fit 2.5
drives into 1.3.5 slots so this gave me 4 slots between the 2 bays and I saved the
2 vertical slots if you need more than 6 2.5 hard drives and again this case will not
suit your needs but it suited me fine.
The one thing that's quite handy is it's almost like the bays are like a weak cadia
plastic cadia you pinch them and it removes the whole thing so you can very easily take
them out if you need to change a hard drive at any point or add a different hard drive.
The PSU is located at the bottom of the case and this is completely hidden away which
is good in a sense because it looks very nice it looks quite neat in fact it looks very
neat you really can't see anything but the problem is it's actually so well hidden
that it makes it quite awkward to fit when the cables are attached and the reason I see
attached is I'm using a modular PSU that are a bunch of cables already in the back area.
Some with loose connections and some are connected to a small circuit board which is kind
of acting as a hub and this is what I first hit a snag with this build.
The manual that comes with it is the most generic manual that looks like it was written
about 15 years ago so probably about the last time I bought a case.
It went through the steps of adding a motherboard with a genetic note to make sure to connect
the Y the jumpersh to the correct motherboard pins or the buttons and USBs at the front
of your PC case will not work.
I'm putting question marks here because there is no buttons or USBs at the front of this case
but we'll come back to it in a minute. The other thing it gives no mentions of this connection
of the PCB at the back of the way of the for the various fan connections either so there
what it describes as the USBs and power button etc at the front is actually at the top of the case
so at the top of the case you have got a power button a reset button a power LED a USB
C a single one and two USB ports full size ones and on top of that a further button for LED display
which will come back to later on a personal note I don't actually have a huge desk so this is
actually handy for me as it made the USBs much more accessible than they were in my last case to
be honest they weren't even used in my last case because it just was such a pain getting to them.
When I realized that this actually was not appropriate instructions I went to the MSI website itself
I put in the case and found it and it said click on manual and forget it and I downloaded a
44 page PDF this is a problem I thought oh that's about it telling me everything no it doesn't
it's the same genetic steps spread over about three or four pages and then on page five it started
in the same in a different language so it actually gave me nothing else so I went on to YouTube
and saw a video of a build using this exact case it was at that point that I actually discovered
because I didn't see anything that within the plastic bag that was actually in the removable caddies
it was kind of tucked away there that's where the manual was now I assumed the wee bag that was there
was just really the screws and things to help you attach everything I hadn't noticed that there's
actually a cable in there with the connections to connect the fans to and then connect the that gets
connected to the motherboard now one thing it is worth noting here is if you're on a budget then
please make sure that your motherboard is a minimum of three fan connections one for the rear fan
one for the three at the front and don't forget you only have another one for your processor heat sink
fan okay the PCB that I mentioned as well it actually gets connected to a SATA powerfully directly
from the PSU all leads all wiring everything like that was hidden completely behind a plate
that the motherboard is attached to and you can feed the connections through using a bunch of rubber
flaps the seven located around where the motherboard is and with the clear glass on the side of this
PC and the LEDs running and actually with the cables not crossing over everything this is well
thought out this really does give a very clean and almost professional look to the PC I can
imagine companies being quite happy to use this case to actually showcase their stuff in action
as I'm kind of mentioned already the PSU was quite awkward to fit but this was the first time I
have to confess that I had used old components into a new case now when I say old I
they're no we're not talking ancient the stuff was not 15 years old I had previously upgraded my PC
at the end of 2022 December 22 so I didn't really need to go for a full PC upgrade given the size
of the case itself attaching the connections from the PSU was actually a really tight fit now I don't
have massive shovel hands and I was really struggling in fact I probably could quite kind of if I
was to buy a CPL a goal of so I don't tend to win that often but it would probably be small to
media it got to the point where it was so tight that putting in the connection that power connection
between the processor and the rear fan you know the one I mean not the big long one the smaller one
was actually that difficult and I was that tight I had to end up getting long needle nose pliers
to save my hands getting scorched and cut against all the components of the case but once
all that was in them like I said the motherboard looked very tidy and in retrospect it probably
was worth the pain and annoyance but I would say get a pair of long nose pliers at the ready before
actually starting this build another part what actually had a bit of an issue was putting together
the case itself to finish off not not putting in the components as I've already spoken about that
but putting in the actual sides back on it because with all the cables behind the plate
it's all like I said really nicely hidden away but I would really like to have seen that back but
a recess or a channel layer for cabling but instead it was nothing and there wasn't a lot of
clearance between the plate and the side panel and this made sliding on that panel really quite awkward
just due to the mass of cabling it was annoying it wasn't that deal breaker it was just rather
annoying just be wary of that now the glass on the opposite side it's nice and clear and it's
certainly heavy enough that I wasn't nervous about handing it I didn't feel this thing was a
better break with the slightest touch it was good hard tempered glass it was nice and thick good
weight to it and slides into position nicely one note is that it does have hand tightening screws
that are common on every PC case these days however I really struggled to open and close them by hand
there really are tight fitting and I actually ended up resorting to a screw driver yes I could
kind of get rid of them but I couldn't close it all the way and it was the same actually taking it
out I found it quite awkward to loosen these initially if you are somebody that likes to tinker
on awful lot with a PC hardware then a word of warning this isn't a hinged side the glass
needs to slide all the way out for you can actually get into it and this is maybe something you want
to take into consideration but given the price of under a hundred pound I'm not really expecting
a hinged door on the side something else that I did notice was that the front of the case is made
of when you're looking at the front on the right hand side it's completely black plastic well
you do actually have the option it is available in white but the one I chose was a black one
because all the other parts of the PC are black and one's sticking out it's completely solid with an
MSI logo on it lower it's a price and on the left there's glass it's like a glass bit and these
are kind of at a kind of tapered at me be like I don't know if you're looking at from the top
maybe about a 30 degree angle maybe a 20 degree something around that just to give it a bit of
design given there are three fans right there behind it I would actually have expected half of
that at least to have been meshed to allow much more air flow there is a gap like a five mil gap
in the middle and there's a gap at the top and a gap at the bottom however I think here that
they really have gone for form over function you can actually feel if you put your hands to it you
can actually feel the air blowing out so you know there is air getting through but if you're a
serious gamer then that might be something that you want to consider although insane that
and this again I wasn't to do with a manual this was from my youtube video there is a mesh the whole
top is mesh with a magnetic strip on the top so that nothing sort of basically fall down into it
but that area is actually designed to put a top selection of fans I'm assuming they're
designed specifically for the case I don't really know or is it just standard I have I didn't
look into it so if you're a serious gamer this may be something that you might want to look at
a form is clearly a very big thing with this case the LED button on the top which I've
mentioned at the start I'm going to come back to now it's just a simple place you press it and
it changes the display that is on offering now you can switch this from it just being a single color
so it could be like you could just have blue you could just have red just have yellow just have green
whatever you want and in fact what's actually quite nice is there's a few different tones like
right now I've got the kind of darker blue on there and there is a much lighter blue as well it
was the same you could have like a pink or you could have a deep red or if you want you could have
multiple colors now you can have these as constant or you can actually have changing effects
to be honest I'm not one that roverly loves changing lights and constantly changing so I just
stuck it on the one I'm just going to leave it there but if you had something that you're
interested in and this is definitely it it's something you're going to appeal to you so overall
though I'm extremely happy with this it feels like it's good build quality and maybe one thing I
didn't mention is when you fire it up given the size of the fans and the amount of fans in it it's
incredibly quiet I really do like the fact that it feels solid now if I have built a few for people
on a real budget lately just people wanting PCs for a bit as cheap as you can get them and
the difference between this is really noticeable really is noticeable I mean given the cheaper
ones I was finding was about the £50 mark okay that is maybe a bit of a jump but I'd say it's
worth it because I don't feel I feel like this is actually going to last when it comes to the LEDs
I personally don't need something that reminds me of blackpool illuminations so I'm quite happy
with the fact that you could actually change it I didn't go into the whole thing over you want to
program the LEDs and change all these bits but I dare say it's probably not going to be overly
difficult if you do want to switch them off entirely well one way I suppose is not connect that
back PCB board I don't know if that's going to work I mean I thought I don't want to risk
not having fans on maybe it's in the bios like I said I didn't actually look but for £90 I actually
thought this was a really good mid-range case offering features aesthetics and quality so if
you're in the market for a new board then from a personal note I can recommend this right so
if you are used to me and the other show I do you also know that I usually always have music and
I can not have a bit of track so if you're not into it I try to leave it to the end here we're
just you can just switch off a thumb finish speaking this is cased in a shell by the band cased
if you like this kind of combination of tech talk and music then please do check us out
I'm one of three other posts on tuxjam so checks out that's tuxjam.otherside.network and I hope
you'll be hearing me again in the not too distant future if you're thinking I would like to do
this and I've never tried this then go on ahead record something that you think will be of interest
to other hackers it doesn't have to be over over any technical have a look at the list there there's
quite a variety of you feel there's something that hackers will be interested then please do
file a wee on that until next time bye
far away right now i'm going to be lacking your help far away but i can feel you in my chest
i want to scream to make you know i know you're there i want to sing this song like i don't even care about
sure how it is else
there's a lot to sell those love in my bed there's a lot to make me feel the absence
