This train is sort of inbound.
I'm praying for you.
Sectors.
My crime is that of outsmarting you.
If you have not yet submitted your identity to the Retinal Clearance System.
Communications, interface, online.
You're not dealing with AT&T.
Automatic medical systems engaged.
Welcome to the Internet, my friend.
How can I help you?
Defense of a weapon selection system activated.
Have a very safe day.
From San Diego, California, I'm Draco Nubis.
And from Florida, I'm Enigma.
I guess today.
Did you forget?
I forgot my name this today.
Well, how's it going down there besides that?
Oh, not too bad.
Are you happy I got your sound equipment?
And I sound better now?
Oh, do you hear a audience?
Do you hear him?
Are you ready for a miracle?
Break my gimmicks?
Oh, feel it, audience.
Enigma, say something.
Speak to the people.
Raise your hand with what you did.
Let's go outside to the bride.
Or not?
Oh, that was...
That was good.
That was perfectly timed.
Yeah, audience.
I have to plug...
I have a sound board set up here for a different show.
But I had to plug it in so I can route something into here for today.
Because we have a special thing going on.
So do you want?
I still think we should add that sound board in our normal rotation.
Yeah, we just need to get some clips.
We need to have some things to say.
The closest I can do is say, you know,
it's important to have good audio.
It matters a great deal.
That's the best I got.
But we need to get relevant to the show.
Yes, yes, we do.
Anyway, so what have you been up to, Drake?
I have been mostly preparing to go on a road trip.
And I've actually spent more time preparing for this show than preparing to go on the road trip.
So whenever you're ready, I'll launch into a world of wonder.
So are we talking about your topic tonight?
Oh, yeah, we are.
Oh, okay.
That's why I had the sound board set up.
It wouldn't be here otherwise.
I'm cool with that.
So I've just been working as my usual self, you know, cleaning the windows, mopping the floors.
Yeah, cleaning the windows, mopping the floors.
Do you have the rubber made mop from the last show?
I do not have the rubber made mop.
I should pick that up.
But the hair nets and the socks.
Yeah.
And I'm just going to go with the whole thing of me being a janitor because you're not going to let it drop.
Because it's true.
I'm just going to take it and roll with it.
You know, I posted those pictures of you at mopping those windows.
What do you call when you do the window thing?
Squeegeeing the windows out.
Yeah, you would know that's your job.
Yeah.
I posted it.
I walked right into that one.
I must be tired.
I didn't see that one coming.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I'm so far ahead that when I look back, I see me coming.
Oh, do you?
Yeah.
Okay.
How far ahead I am.
Okay.
I think we should just break right into it.
Because I know you have places to be in things to do.
Yes.
I do.
Well, tonight I want to talk to you about scanners, not the document kind, but the radio kind.
You may not even have heard of this technology, but it is out there and I assure you it is fantastic.
Kind of like a police scanner type deal.
Exactly.
Like a police scanner.
In fact, a police scanner is just a subset of scanners that will only do police channels, but certain bands.
Yeah.
Although usually you can use the terms interchangeably.
Well, I should explain what a scanner is.
So in the air, there are radio waves floating around.
And you can tune into them if you have a specific radio.
Like Wi-Fi tunes to a certain band, 24, 2.4 gigahertz.
Police use certain bands.
Usually it's actually parry is not.
If they're using a trunk system or depending on the jurisdiction.
But there's a lot of stuff floating through the air.
And if you have a scanner, it's almost like you have a radio that can work with any other radio.
And you can tune into the frequency you want.
Like the radio in your car goes from 89 to 100.
And I think it's 102 or 107 in the US.
It's like that only goes down to 25 and up to like 1300.
So you get a lot of stuff to listen to.
Oh, indeed.
So why is this useful?
Well, I'm not sure that it is.
There is a thing you can do where you hit like the WX button.
And it will give you that automated voice that tells you about the weather saying like,
hurricanes approaching from north, south, hurricane.
And you know, that automated weather voice.
Yes.
I know the automated weather voice.
Well, you know, living living living in a hurricane or state.
You know, you get used to the weather radios.
I thought you meant like you just kept it all the time.
Like man, the weather was not that important to me.
No, no, no.
But every every year, you know, you're so around August, you know, July August.
It becomes actually we haven't had a major storm around here for a few years.
But like one summer, we had like four in a row.
You know, and all of them hit us.
So it was just your house.
No one else is a little tornado going around.
No, no, no, no.
It was just our area.
I got, you know, slammed.
You know, the central Florida, I guess.
Well, that's good for your business.
A lot of cleanup to do.
A lot of windows to wash.
Yeah, thanks.
Appreciate it.
Yes, but I suppose you could also argue that it's good for listening to the police
or fire to see if they're doing their job or something.
But I can't think.
It's just a fun toy to have.
Although interestingly enough, I just happen to be looking at the form you fill out
if you want to say that you've seen a crime anonymously.
And one of the things they ask you into the drug dealing section is,
do you suspect that a police scanner is involved?
So apparently they take the threat of drug dealers using police scanners to
as a lookout very seriously.
And I didn't actually think that was that, oh, prevalent.
Well, you know, people being nosy, you know, wanting to, you know,
police scanners or, you know, those type of scanners used to be available,
you know, fairly easily to get a hold of, you know, radio shactor.
Yeah, radio shack used to make some of the best ones,
or not the best ones, but the cheapest ones.
In fact, they actually have a radio shack scanner somewhere.
Pick one up for like 50 bucks, you know, $57 and you know, off the way you go.
They've lasted forever.
You know, people using for NASCAR events too, but I suppose that begs the question.
If you can listen to police and fire and all kinds of magic stuff as this legal,
well, actually, yeah, in fact, it's not only is it legal,
but it's considered almost like a right to bear arms things
because people have challenged it in such a way that it's saying,
oh, no, we get to have a checking balance on the police department.
If they can break into our homes, we get to listen to what they're talking about,
that kind of thing, or I guess a better example is if they can wire tap us,
we can wire tap them sort of a thing.
So it's actually very, very legal to have.
The only exception is that they block out certain bands,
like the old cellular band is blocked out, the modern core of this phone band is knocked out,
so you can't listen to phone calls.
And they have some interesting rules around it.
Usually, if you commit a crime that involves a scanner, the penalty is higher,
there are laws to what you can do with the information you find.
You can't sell the information.
You can talk about it, but you can't sell it.
It took me a while to figure out what they were talking about,
because what would you possibly hear that you'd want to sell?
And it's for these companies that will like listen to taxi dispatch companies
or like prostitute dispatch, or not prostitute,
what I call escort dispatch services.
They'll listen to that and they get a taxi or a girl at the destination faster
and steal business from someone else by listening to a radio network like that.
Yeah, so.
And, you know, the taxi band, that's on there too, right?
Like the...
Yeah, no, you can do that.
That's why they had to pass a law saying it's illegal to listen to them
and then sell it to your taxi company, right?
I'm sure there's plenty of fun and interesting information you can find out.
Yes, you can.
In fact, I have a couple of things programmed in tonight,
and I'm listening to the scan around with one earpiece,
waiting for something in particular.
So when it comes, I'll jump into it because it's worth it.
I just hope I can catch it.
So if I start a little bit somehow, I get two conversations,
although I start all the time anyway.
Yeah, I know you do.
It's okay.
Well, I think faster than I talk,
and right now I'm looking at all these levels,
and there's pizza all over my notes, which are actually useless,
so it doesn't really matter.
Yeah, we can do just ramble.
It's okay.
It's okay, Drake.
I know.
So these things are easily available as we touched on earlier,
and I suppose, you know, there's a lot out there,
what do you want to look for?
Well, you can buy the cheapest thing possible and be happy
if you've never done this before.
The only distinguishing feature really is that they have things
like larger bands, certain extra bands are in there.
A big thing is that the really expensive ones,
like I have a BCT-15X made by Uniden,
it's unbelievably great scanner.
But what makes it so great is the way it can handle trunk systems,
and trunk systems are a way of consolidating radios
for both security and just performance
on a certain given set of frequencies,
because let's say you have an entire law enforcement agency,
that would be a lot of frequencies
if you wanted to have a bunch of police all talking to each other.
Like if you wanted to find a certain, you know,
just your partner or whatever,
you and your partner would have to have, you know,
just a certain set channel,
and it consumes a lot of bandwidth.
So what trunk systems do is they work on,
and all the radios will share a set of frequencies,
and when they transmit, they transmit out of code.
It's usually called a talk code,
it's a Motorola system or other code types.
And you'll have a radio tune to say,
well, unless a transmission comes in that begins with this code,
don't open the speaker.
So that way you only hear and can only talk to people
in your particular talk a group.
And if you tune to these frequencies without a scanner
that can follow trunks,
you just hear a bunch of random conversations
because the radios are skipping around
to whatever frequencies available,
and you're hearing just all kinds of,
the conversations don't flow.
Yeah, we had a similar setup at,
I worked at a correctional facility for a couple of years,
and we had a, for all of our juvenile correction officers,
they would carry a radio,
which worked, you know,
it was just basically a scanner that they could talk on.
And like the master control,
the ops area would be in this scenario
that you were talking about,
would basically just scan all the frequencies
and could pop in and listen on any particular,
you know, conversation.
Yeah, that's about how they work.
In fact, they make radios that are called a transceiver.
Your quality just got really bad.
Not as many.
Stand by.
Baby, come back.
Yeah, you are.
You sound like,
we'll go back.
Good to see.
There was something.
And everything.
Nope, still rubber band.
Yeah, really rubber band.
Yes.
You can play it all over me.
Okay.
Anyway, now that we're back,
I think we're just touching on trunk systems
and how cool they are.
Yes.
There were a couple other features
you might want to watch out for,
like with the BCT-15X,
you can actually plug it into your computer
and control it with the computer,
which is what I'm doing right now.
And there are these really cool benefits to that,
because there are sites like,
am I going through a wind tunnel?
What the hell?
Oh, fascinating.
Can you turn yours
to only transmit when you're talking?
Okay.
That's a lot better.
That's a lot better.
Okay, so.
Okay.
This time is government.
So this time for real.
This time for real.
So trunk systems, that's a benefit.
If you want to plug it in your computer,
which is great,
because there are all these sites
where you can download trunk systems
and frequency lists
and just shove it into the scanner
and that's wonderful.
There are things like band scope,
where you can say, look at bands,
96 megahertz to 100 megahertz.
It will scan each channel very fast
and repeat the scan over and over
and show you a peak graph
of which channels are transmitting
so you can hone in on things.
There's a great feature called
close call.
It's branded differently
amongst the different scanner manufacturers.
But basically, devices exist
that are called frequency counters,
where when something starts transmitting,
if you're close enough to it,
it can count the frequency
of the transmitting thing
because it's so powerful
that it almost kind of drowns everything
out at close range.
So with the close call,
it's like a built-in frequency scanner.
Where it waits for something
nearby to transmit and then locks on to it.
So you can be on the freeway
and a cop can pull up next to
and talk on this radio
and your scanner automatically
lock on to it.
Which is very interesting.
Yeah, it's very equivalent
to used occasionally.
You kind of forget it's on
and it scares you.
It makes a lot of noise.
But that's about it on the features.
If you just want to break into the field,
just go on Craigslist
or eBay, like 30 bucks,
pick anything up.
It's going to be fun.
Good times.
Good times indeed.
Now we talked about trunk systems.
So let me give you an example
of some of the cool things
you can do here.
Let me do this.
Hold on.
That's it.
That's all right.
Okay.
So there's a trunk system
in place for SDG&E,
San Diego Gas and Electric.
And the individual talk groups
are labeled.
So if I lock on to one
like a computer help desk,
we usually get lucky
about this time.
So...
Yeah, twice today I've got a method
on my MDE that says
A6, AX, 88, 772.
The USC 2.0,
the class ethernet adapter
has exceeded the power limit
of its hub port.
Oh, I had that problem earlier.
And what is that?
This is San Diego Gas and Electric.
No, I meant what is the whole
exceeded power.
Oh.
That's an amperage thing.
You just plugged that in today?
Or have you been using that?
For the exciting conclusion.
Give me a favorite go to Start
and then go to
Pro panel.
Well, they're actually doing
troubleshooting over the air.
These are just calling the phone here.
Click on Hardware
and it's the right manager.
Yeah, that must be painful.
Yeah, I'm surprised the guy didn't have that.
The patient's carry privileges
unsolved by the change
properties of the device settings.
Oh, because you're not an administrator.
Yeah.
I need to come in this door
to take a look at that.
Yeah, really?
Okay, let me call my dispatcher.
Okay, now that.
But so that's cool.
So you can lock in on certain things
and there are other people
talking on the SDG network.
But because I was only looking
for them and I was looking
across to range frequencies,
I could find them
and lock onto that.
And similarly, I could do something like
like I can grab onto.
This is a fruit picking company.
Of course.
That's very stereotypical.
Those migrant workers in San Diego.
It could actually be Mexico.
You know, we're on the border.
But I think most of the fruit grows in San Diego.
So yeah.
If I was guessing it would be a migrant worker
that came a little bit north of the border.
Well, you can tell
because they're always overmodulated
when they talk.
This is true for Mexican radio
and for Arabic radio.
Like whatever the guy's talking,
they think it's close to the mic.
It's like,
and just really peak things out.
It's obnoxious.
You might want to be careful
on the Arabic jokes.
There are certain people
that speak Arabic
that listen to the show.
No, no, that's not a...
That's like saying that, you know.
I'm just saying.
I know.
But that's like saying that in America
we have really flashy news.
And we do.
We have people on Fox News.
They're like half naked.
Talking about...
I don't know what Fox News talks about.
Speaking of...
I have a story later.
So go ahead.
Write it down so you don't forget.
But ask her if it's true
that radio stations in the Middle East
are way overmodulated.
She'll be like, yeah, it's really annoying.
I don't know.
You know, I just find it noisy.
If she listens to this,
she's going to smack me.
But I just find the language very...
That's so much worse than what I said.
I said that they're overmodulated.
You're like, I hate the language.
I hate the people.
I didn't say I called for...
Oh, you're so going to get me in trouble.
The audience can't tell.
But he's burning a flag in the webcam.
What is...
What are you doing?
Where'd you get that?
Okay.
For those of you who don't know,
you know,
my girlfriend is...
You don't say...
Yeah, I don't say girlfriend.
And they use the words interchangeably.
Which she's probably going to hurt me for anyway.
She is Lebanese.
Thus, you know, we...
Thus her language is annoying,
and she's a bad person.
Oh, man.
Just see what you say.
Damn it.
Shut up.
All right, move on.
Before you get into any more trouble,
okay, there's things like,
let's quickly get off the topic.
What's fun to listen to?
Radio is fun to listen to.
Oh, radio.
Air, air traffic.
Air traffic control.
Air traffic control.
Do it the unless 0 MAC to 4 the EX.
For our conditions,
0 MAC to 8.0.
Or this is the military base.
Sterbally 1.0.
Fueled at 1,500.
Temperature 2.1.
2.1310 2.10
Correct.
Right.
Yeah, I know.
You never hit it down and learned...
Obviously.
Okay.
But we're really listening to that...
or actually, he风s.
Right on the tips.
That's actually what's called the,
like, ATI S or 1.
Say, that's a loops an recording that they...
They change periodically?
And it's proven pilots
are approaching or...
approaching or getting it for takeoff or what have you.
They tune to that get all the information
and then it loops for like 20 seconds
and then they take off like I can actually
there's a nearby airfield for,
well, it's just, you know, it's an airfield,
it's not an airport, just for people who own planes.
If I walk onto that one, I have that one favorited,
we should get a slightly different one
but that will also loop.
Come on, here.
You think you had a favorited.
Okay, nope, I thought I'd, oh, oh, I see what I'd do.
Looking for an important information hotel.
2253 sea of the weather.
Wind, two, three, zero to eight,
visibility, one, zero, straight to two, two, one,
two point, one, four, out to two, two, two, two, eight, six.
I almost certainly too read a book in use.
So with the land, one way, two, three,
landing in the department, one way, two, three.
Notice there, I'm gonna be a T out of service.
I'll fully back them off,
towards the construction of a wind sound,
it's interquired with your call sign,
advise you of information, hotel.
Hotel?
Yeah, that's part of the, the phonetic alphabet,
I know the alphabet, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.
Yeah, but it's hotel.
Yeah, well, did you get what he was saying there?
It's actually, I think it might have been breaking up for you,
but it would have played well for me.
Yeah, what they do is each time they recording,
okay, that's it, things changed on your side.
Oh, never mind, crazy things were happening.
But the, it's in one of those nights.
The recording is updated every so many minutes,
like every time, I think it's a periodical thing.
So you have to say which recording you're listening to
so that the air traffic controller knows
if you had information that's now outdated.
And what he said, I can actually walk you through
because I have a passing experience with my father,
has a pilot's license and my grandfather worked for
very, very high up in a certain airline.
But what he said was this was recording hotel.
There's no, or these things always going.
And he said the time was two, two, five, three.
That's on a 24 hour clock.
So two, two, colon, five, three, wind, two, oh,
wind, two, oh, three at eight,
means that the wind is a two, oh, three
that kind of compass needle.
And it's at eight knots, the actual speed of it.
And then he said the visibility,
which is at the different cloud levels,
the temperature he gave, the dew point and the altitude.
I don't remember them.
I do remember he said the altitude is on a 29.86,
which is not, I'm sorry, that the altimeter is 29.86 thing.
That's not a scale.
It's a measurement of how much mercury is being used
and it affects your altimeter measurement.
So you need to know all the measurements
and then how they were measured.
So they include the 2.86.
And occasionally it's millimeters or millibars
or hektopast cows, whatever the other language is.
I have no idea what a hektopast cow is.
I only remember because of the programming language.
And then he just finishes up with the runway two,
three is for landing and departing.
He said that they do not have GPS assisted landing available
and that all instructions have to be read back to the controller.
And then I'm pretty sure he said I missed landing
to tell the controller that you've read
that you've heard of a recording hotel, so.
Got it, okay.
Now you know how to land a plane.
Oh, yeah, I'll be doing that in my spare time.
Yeah, well, I've always wanted a princess to fly.
Oh, the thing I've been waiting for all night
just showed up on a second patch.
10, 4, 10, 25.
4, 2, 8, 2.
And police or no, no?
4, 2, 8, 2, 9, 3, 2, 8, 0, 8, 7, 0, 3, 5, 4, 5.
Expression one of 13.
Billion zip is nine two one two three numbers on the back.
Two four, two, three, five, nine, six.
That's wrong.
The amount is 93, 50, 93, 4, 5, oh.
So what do you want to guess that is?
I'm not.
That would probably be a credit card number.
That's an incredibly irresponsible company
that I don't want to, I don't want to give away either.
I need to write them a letter and say not to do this one.
But they have people in the field.
And those people need to be able to process credit cards.
And to do that, they radio the credit cards back to HQ.
And there you go.
So you could just sit here all day and collect credit cards.
In fact, if you go into other frequencies,
I can probably find a couple more before the night is over.
But that's just what any of these be like a transportation
company, perhaps?
Yeah, yeah, it would be.
Yeah, I'm thinking so.
But so that's I, you know, they make mobile units.
So they can they cost a little bit, but they go in the car
and you can swipe the credit card and there you go.
Yeah, I've seen them, but I've also seen.
You've seen this practice.
I've seen this in practice.
What's really bad is they give you all the information you need.
They give you the numbers in the back, the expiration date.
And more importantly, they give you the billing zip code.
People don't know this.
The way cards do validation the way they tell if you're like making
an illegal transaction is that you need to have the correct
billing zip code.
So if I have your credit card, Nigma, and I use it,
but I don't know your billing zip code, it will look fraudulent
and suspicious and you're not liable for it.
It's not even the name.
You don't need the name.
You can put any name you want.
Like try to try to ask anybody something with a credit card.
Use the name like, you know, Dick Cheney, you know,
we'll go through just fine.
But if the billing zip code is wrong,
that's what trips up the whole thing.
Yeah, and I'll just put a disclaimer here.
We do not approve of any ill will.
Yeah, no, yeah.
Just disclaimer, big red disclaimer.
Yeah, but I just, I thought it makes sense.
That's pretty cool, but yeah, that was pretty cool.
I'll grant it, but very, very bad.
Extremely back, extremely unethical, extremely unmoly people
need to, I'll write them a letter after the show, I think.
Yes.
Small tangential, a tangential relationship.
I know someone who does use to program the algorithms
for credit card fraud detection systems.
Do you want to know the number one thing you can do
to just instantly kill your card
with suspicious activity?
What's that?
If you buy three tanks of gas,
and ask me three tanks, almost three full tanks,
and then buy a pair of sneakers, your card will be dead,
and you have to call and get it reactivated.
Why three tanks of gas and a...
Because that isn't like 90 something percent
of all illicit transactions.
Someone finds a card on the ground.
They fill up their gas tank.
They go, man, this is cool.
They call their friends, fill up the friends gas tank,
and then they go out and buy expensive shoes.
Why shoes?
I think the people that...
Oh, ripin' me into it.
Because I think that in the hip hop and gangster
and like a black and Mexican culture,
that shoes are a big deal.
Okay.
So, well, no, that's...
It's just alienated some of our audience,
but that's okay.
Well, there, it's true.
It's this is programmed into the system
for just this reason.
It's a statistic.
Okay.
Alienating our audience, but that's okay.
I'm cool with that.
I'd like to know if we have any people
who deal credit, or wait.
Well, no mind.
But...
Be careful.
Yeah.
Had any rate.
So, that's all of the fun with scanners.
That's all I got.
Maybe if I can do something like this,
hold on a second.
Oh, you know, let's try, please.
We haven't done police all night.
Where's...
Dude, at 315, you put on a CCW call.
Inside the Starbucks mail told the ARC's supervisor...
Now, he had a gun because he was in one territory,
and he's a critic.
Hmm.
Try to get a description of it.
That ship, again, should be inside Starbucks.
Inside the Starbucks...
Wait, wait.
At 20, at 60, I'll divert from this call over there.
Yeah.
That's just embarrassing.
Hmm.
So, that's my whole deal.
Uh, we can go ahead and end the show here.
Do you have anything to add?
You said that you had something earlier?
Yes, I have something earlier on the...
Along the lines of...
We were talking about Middle East and...
Um, Plexi's on a world tour.
She's actually in China for a few days at a conference.
And...
Ask her if poor people spend a lot of money on shoes.
I will.
I will do that.
It's like Rims for a car.
You see this happen.
And I've been getting her to take payphone pictures
