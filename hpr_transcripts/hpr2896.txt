Good day, my name is JWP, I have a heck of a book radio today, I saw that there's been
a lot of emails in the box and that Kent had needed something and I'm still listening
to a lot of it, a lot of it, the content all the way through.
What I wanted to talk about today is, you know, the last couple of times I did stuff
about work and I do have one about Intel Optine memory coming to work like for me coming
up pretty soon.
But what I wanted to talk about today was, I got a little nerdy, I guess, I thought, you
know, if you ever want to get in financial trouble or buy stuff at the spur of the moment,
you need to get the puning and Tom's hardware and a few of those others in your honest
feed and read it early in the morning, I don't buy more stuff than I really know what
to do with.
But I've always been a fan of the orange PI0 with the H2 plus processor because it is so
much faster than my Raspberry 0.
I mean, it just really, really is the same 512 memory, but it is just really, really
fast.
And so they came out with the LTS version of it, I think that it cost me $9 and you get
the expansion board to add to more USB ports to it.
They're coming out with what they call a Raspberry 0 plus, they have the HMI connector and
stuff like that.
I got it from AliExpress's Tom and AliExpress's, the manufacturer has a direct site on there
that comes from there before I got it on Thank Good.
And the great thing about it is that they ship anywhere in the world so that AliExpress
and Thank Good, wherever you might need it, they'll get it.
So it was non-bucks for the PC and I think $3 or $4 for the USB expansion and then two
bucks a case.
Now one caveat is I do not get the power supplies from there, from those guys.
I found that the power supplies are very, very great, so what I'll do is I'll go to the
Conrad Electronics here in Germany and I will get a good 5 volt, basically a Raspberry
3 thing for them and plug it in and use that.
So this is my third one, but these two are the LTS version that are trying to stabilize
on that for a while and I used the R&B in and it was a 200 megabyte download and it's
quite, it was quite, quite okay.
You know, I flashed it with Etcher and booted up and the way that I do this is I have a
very, very old GP link router that I have that I have the free and open source routing
software on, I forget the name of that man.
So it's LUS, it's Lula and then it comes up and you put it in and I've disabled a
Wi-Fi on that.
It's only for a router that does switches, that I could always turn it back on, but it
was a $19 router and I wanted to flash it and I got that free operating system on there
and what this is really good for is I plug it into a wall.
I take my IBM, Lenovo IBM laptop and put it in and then plug the zero in and then
it's got its own little domain and I'm able to see where the IP address is and then I
go right there and then I go through the initial setup and then I copy the MAC address and
I take the MAC address in the Lenovo over to my home Wi-Fi and connect it and then put
the MAC address and assign the MAC address, I gracefully shut down the orange P.I.0 LTS version
and then I go and plug it back into the home router system and he comes up and I can see
him and do all the SSH stuff and what I'll do is even though it's only got 5, 12 RAM,
I will go ahead and I want to install the Davian LXDE on it and the other two I installed
the XSE on and the reason is that I like to use you get and so like I have like a farm
on these little 5, 5 of these things that I will get YouTube videos and these clips and
music stuff and b-mo and all kinds of stuff and I'll use you get to download that and
I just copy paste with DNC and I'm pulling only some of these boxes on the LXDE it's
hard to get it over 100 megabytes it really is and of course I use YouTube DLM and they're
connected to all of the connected to NFS, NFS shares I can do whatever I want to do and
I've even tried some transcoding on these things but across the board on all these little
devices the Orange PI is Orange PI 0 is significantly faster than the Raspberry 0 and it beats the
Raspberry 2 for sure and the Raspberry 3, see it's a different animal because the Raspberry
3 you can get application-specific things applied so in other words you can go to own cloud
and get an own cloud version specifically for the 3B and you can get as soon as a version
and I'll choose the LTS versions and you can get a 3D open-media bump of direct image that
works specifically with the 3D or 3D plus from open-media bump so the Raspberry state with these
specific things tailored to them are very very good that said I have a 512 model A that
you own with the Wi-Fi and nice Bluetooth in it and I thought that up and it was also pretty
well but it's significantly more than $9 it's yeah I had to say there are over 30 euros for that
thing and then I had to add the case and the power supply so then I was looking at 50 bucks
whereas whereas this was right in line with $20 I had to pay more for the power supply than I did
anything else one thing of note is the memory cards now the Orange PI people they will come out
right away and say that you need the A1 so you'll see the that these cards have A1, A2 on them
that says that the drivers aren't in the kernel for the A2 cards now that's what they said on
the sprite and I've had them with both and one thing that I can tell you for sure is that the original
Orange PI that thing will eat a memory card pretty quick I have one that's on his third memory card
and not like okay well and I found that that for me the the 16 gigabyte A1 A1 with a fastest
from standard it seems to be the best one that Amazon just did in bulk 30 by 4,000 at the same time
and they don't come in actual pleas and then you put them in but I found that those last
longer so I've had a couple of 64s and 128s that I tried to do all kinds of projects with and
and I just didn't work out with 16 it seems to be the way to go and
connected to the net NFS server and having him if he needs to write something do all of that
stuff on the NFS server via the multimedia vault thing and I did a show about that previously
about opening the vault and the things that I do there well I mean and the other thing is that
it's sort of a family project at LTS so I have a wife my wife that's so good and we sort of
sit there and put them together ourselves I have to do the software thing and at course with the
BMT servers the time I have had the problems just just ever ever so slight problems that somehow
in this new buster they they didn't and this is the first time I used buster versus stretch
I used buster this time and I had problems with font so I know I had installed a font and then
I had to go through the steps again from digital ocean to set it up and I noticed that my old one
run the stretch with LXBE was I just like it a lot better and the way that I did that was I got
the basis of them installed and then I installed LXBE and then I installed the NFS server and then
I installed the two applications that I wanted or three applications that I wanted on they do get
youtube dl and and the door browser and even with the door you rarely get over 397 I
thought I needed to bring up something to copy paste or some kind of RSS thing or something that
was my door at the time so anyway the CPU that it's really really good and you know I've had
very in lock I mean for non-blocks you get some hit and this is uh get hit and this is I mean one
of them like I said each the memory card really well the other one gets pretty hot you know one
of the other original orange PIs and melted he melts his case I haven't placed the case he just
gets hot and somehow that's turning off because it's about getting the case hot but the newer one
it's been sitting up on my shelf next to my Raspberry 3 model A that I got for Christmas last year
and it's working absolutely fall asleep no heat no dispensation no anything all right well
hey it's 11 minutes and I'm sure y'all have better thing to do the most new rumble about the
orange PI LTS zero LTS but if you want to get one it's a great little buy at nine it's $10 and
do get the USB expansion thing for three dollars and a little case and don't forget it to get
a good local power supply and it works just fine with the 3B power supply so if you go on your
electronic store the 3B power supply works just fine with it try to get to skinny one so it doesn't
take up all that room on your on your board all right y'all take care be safe if you need anything
or want to communicate with me it's a great MVP 5 at hotmail.com all right bye
