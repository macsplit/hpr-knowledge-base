Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of HPR15.com.
With your host Operator, today I'm going to be talking about shaving and my experience
with safety razors as of now and some background and other shaving things that I've looked
at.
I've been shaving with your traditional multi blade for 5 blade and whatever razor for
quite some time and I had a friend that was into the whole safety razor thing.
So I ordered or I put on my wish list a beginner level safety razor and a multi razor kit,
like a sample kit where you get a bunch of different kinds of razor blades and you get
sample them.
So I got those for Christmas probably, I want to say two years ago maybe or maybe a year ago.
And I've been using safety razors ever since for a number of reasons because they're
you know a little bit more environmentally friendly and you can get kind of a better shave slash
more less aggressive shave.
So I've looked a lot of videos and I've kind of fumbled around but in general I do like it better.
It does take more time so if you're the type of person that you know is in a hurry all the time
when you're shaving which that's why you wreck your face in the first place you're probably not
going to want to do a safety razor much less like a straight razor and I haven't looked at straight
razors and I don't necessarily plan to. The safety razor I have is kind of a beginner one but
it has little ridges in it so that it's not straight up razor to your face so the idea is that
it has little ridges where it meets the blade more or less so that you're not straight up just
shaving without any safety part. I'm just kind of hard to explain but and then there's ones that
it's just flat across and if you bear down then you're going to bear down and shave a layer off of
your skin whereas if you bear down on this one you would shave you know eight layers off of your
skin at a little little straight so I have cut myself with it but not really bad most of the time
it's because I'm in a hurry and trying to you know to a quick shave and that's not something you
can really do with a safety razor it's you know take your time and don't wreck your face type of thing
so it is kind of a ritual it's it's kind of something that makes you sort of feel good it's kind
of a grooming thing so when I do have time for it I do actually enjoy it but it's it's not
something you can do quickly so it's kind of a you know it's been like a I think I shaved almost
almost a week ago now so I just shaved just now and I thought I'd do a quick episode
and kind of explain you know where I'm at and you know the whole sample pack thing and the whole
razor blade sampling and stuff I I honestly can't tell one from the other I don't know how I
mean it's a bit kind of like a you know a wine enthusiast or whatever they can you know smell the
different wines and really understand I'm not that super into it kind of a blade is a blade for me
I can't really can't really tell the difference now I can't tell the difference of a blade
is been sitting or if I've used it more than like three or four times even three times I feel a
difference I feel a difference and and subsequently my face and skin feels a difference afterwards so
you know so for example if I shave on day one with a brand new razor and I'll let that shave that
razor sit for like a week I feel like it when I pick it back up even even though I've tried the
whole method of drying the razor blade to make sure it's you know dry I think once you cut with it
once you break it and you've cut with it and it kind of the timer starts to count down I feel like
it now might be wrong but I feel like after about one or two shaves and I let it sit for a day or two
or even you know between shavings if I let it sit too long you know I end up trying to wreck my face
trying to shave so it's you know winning doubt grab another blade especially if you're new
and you're you know trying to figure it out and you're trying to get used to a routine or whatever
grab a new blade kind of every time win into out grab a new blade um and then maybe if you're
you know get experience and you get into a routine then you can start kind of saying okay I don't
necessarily need a new blade but if there's any question at all it's your face and you don't want
to be walking around having an itchy face all day or whatever because you try to you know
rake your face because your blade it's all messed up so um I use kind of like I said the safety
razor that's kind of the metal screw uh screw ones like three part safety razor and it has a
little ridges kind of safety ridges so it's just not straight up uh safety razor on your face
and the stuff I use which was suggested to me years ago even before I switched to a straight
razor or a safety razor um true fit and hill west indian lines shaving cream uh and I use a I think
not the fancier one but this uh corsair here like a beaver I think it is um or something it's not
beaver it's something else it's the more of course whatever and really kind of anyone what we'll do
they're pretty cheap even if you buy a nice uh fancier one so that wasn't the deal breaker really
the blades excuse me get a box I think I've got a box of the big silver or something like that
I ended up um getting those based on you know some reviews people had but it seems like it's all
over the place because some people will say this razor works better with this blade I feel like
this razor and it's kind of a thing of preference but for me in my experience level I just feel
like a blade to blade I've done all the samples I'm almost out of the samples and I don't I can't
you know it's such a minute difference for me I don't have the the mental competency and capacity
to sit there and like shave my face and then like switch to razor or something and shave the other
side of my face and try to feel the difference um and I just don't think it's that you know unless my
face is having issues I just don't think it's that big of a deal for me I just go offer reviews
and go from there um let's see I think one thing I'll talk about is electric razors you know
get them a Costco whatever they're all really kind of sort of the same you know want to spend a
ton of money on them they're all kind of operate the same way um the blades do crap out so
if you plan on holding one for a while you have to keep in mind that the battery is going to last
to you about five years actually there are more and then the little blades are the tricky part that
you might want more if it comes with one you might want to order another one um kind of any more
than having three extra blades you're really just kind of waiting for the thing to crap out they're
all made out of plastic and kind of garbage so the electric razors I'll use
to be when I don't necessarily have time to shave and in between shavings so if I'm I don't have
time to sit down and shave or stand up and shave um I'll use the electric razor to kind of just
just give me something to get rid of some of the five o'clock shadow or whatever
um other than that so let's see haven't tried straight razors
um the regular you know box razors I'll keep a regular plastic disposable razor in my
book bag so just in case you know I have some skin irritation or maybe I you know miss the
spot on my neck or something I'll keep one in my car and keep one in my book bag just in case
I need to like touch up or something bothering me on my face um use a little magnifying mirror
if you have one or one of those side scrolling um mountable mirrors that goes next to the window
like if you ever go to a hotel it's a pull out mirror and it slides out and you can see kind of
see your face um it makes a big difference you know and over time you'll notice you'll get better
the direction of your face the direction of the hair on your face so um you know when I started
out I was shaving their own direction kind of under my chin and upsetting my hair um I shave
in some places I shave um sideways to the grain and not again I don't go against the grain at all
really except for kind of one to one place but in general I kind of shaved to the side
so that I get um have better a closer shave but I'm not shaving against the grain and wrecking my
face um I think you can do against the grain you just have to be consistent about it so
I don't shave consistently so I can't consistently go against the grain um I think if you shave
every day and you go against the grain your face will kind of get used to it and you take care of
the aftershave I use is one of those doptera things that I got but really
any aftershave that that's not like crappy Walmart stuff that burns your face off like the
home alone movie right um it's gonna be good for that uh just don't cheap out don't get
something that's kind of bunch of smelly stuff for alcohol waste um even just a lotion is
better than getting some crap from Walmart or whatever so look around get some nice
aftershave um mines you know got a bunch of weird fragrances in it and it doesn't seem to bother
my face that much um it's more of just staying on top of it and exfoliating so after you do shave
like for example I have a shaved along with a week I'll probably you know when I'm in the shower
next or in the morning I'll try to uh use a little like a little it's a sponge basically um and
I'll scrub my face with that a little bit wash my face um neither during the day or there are um
in the shower and I also have a pumice stone which you're probably shouldn't excuse me
excuse me late you probably shouldn't take a pumice stone to your face but I do when it's really
bad um sometimes if it's been a while or there's a there's a butter zone where after I shave two or
three days after I shave and then I shave again and I you know sweaty or something it's some kind
of thing between shavings um where my skin will get super pissed off and it will have a bunch
of ingrowns so I'll actually use the pumice stone to force those ingrowns out because my face will
just it's for like half a day if I don't so sometimes I'll I'll I'll take the pumice stone to
it when it's really bad under my chin um I can get bad under my chin because it's really tight
skin over there and I'll go against or um kind of sideways to the grain sometimes and it'll
cause ingrowns when I don't exfoliate enough so I'm sure there's all much other stuff that
belong online you can learn but I'm just kind of sharing my experience and uh give the safety
razors a shot and if you don't like it then you can give it away as somebody else and have them
try them out it's all relatively cheap uh cheap stuff even the decent stuff is cheap now this
Truffin Hill stuff is not cheap but the thing is you go to Walmart and you buy julya
tubing joe this like in garbage and wrecks your face um that's not gonna last you nearly as long
as one of these Truffin Hill's I mean I don't know how many ounces this thing is 6.7
6.7 ounces and I'll say maybe I don't even know how to I mean maybe it teaspoon two teaspoons
worth of actual uh stuff can actually give you a full shave if you're if you're modest enough
with it so um one of these will last me a year if not a year and some change um now that I'm
actually shaving more it might not last me as long because I'm going more into the office but
anyways I hope that's helped somebody else and um kind of against Truffin Hill West Indian
Mimes is the stuff I like they have a different scent but I like the West Indian Mimes stuff
hope that helps somebody else take it easy
