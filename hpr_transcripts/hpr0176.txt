Music
The number large doesn't have a search of the reason for it.
I want a tee head channel bolts, they're having fun from some places in California because I didn't find them.
You don't want to have to tell me because they have different pricing at every store and they don't want to have to put the pricing on the Internet.
I see.
They're really working as this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whoo!
No, I'm here.
No.
I decided to lift it.
You see all the lights in front of me?
That's probably the only thing I'll make about it.
This stuff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All you do is just push in.
Push in.
Push in.
Push in.
Right.
Push in.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
So Kenny, do you buy your expensive alarm clock yet?
I don't like expensive alarm.
A alarm clock?
No.
Do you need any expensive alarm clock?
No.
No.
Is your laptop or do you have everything that's those?
Yeah.
And a few other things too.
Yeah.
You can buy it.
I thought of all it.
Yeah.
I thought it was pretty pricey for it.
And the glasses.
You can see the lights.
Began the TV.
Yeah.
You can see the lights.
They also have one on the fucking back.
Yeah.
Okay.
They是 the lights.
Right.
They are the light stripe.
Yeah.
They are the light stripe.
They are the lights.
Oh, a regular alarm clock.
Yeah.
We can go red lights.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't go retro,
Woo-hoo!
Hold on, we are on the ground, we are on the ground.
They have to chase it.
Oh, come on, hurry up and cut the...
Good to know that I need to chase them more than once.
Well, that's the part to give you all that.
You know, who got all of that?
We don't have to go through something, but that's what it takes.
Now, sometimes I don't know what to do.
I think the snooze I'm not going to like...
What just happened, it's already like...
What you got to have is some type of ratchets system on the bed,
and you set the alarm clock for us.
So, it seems to get off the bed.
Ratchets system just...
And now you can't play it back down until you, like, enter like a combo or something.
I am good, man, I didn't have to tell the alarm clock across the room,
because, you know, if I didn't get up to shove it off,
I would shove it off from there.
I've always just known that.
The ones that I hate are the ones that it's easier to shove it off and hit the snooze.
So, you end up shoving it off because it's easier.
That's not true.
It's not a bad, you want to keep your job.
You've got to make sure that the snooze is easily accessible,
and the off is not.
I can go with that.
Up down, up down.
I put it in another room.
You just have to do it.
There's a piece of floor.
Anybody read about this new Intel stuff with the multi-core?
It was a post in some of them, so I just didn't get a chance to read out to them.
But Intel is coming out with a new processor architecture that's supposed to be really hot stuff, less power.
So, somehow parts of the...
It combines the memory and the processor on the main chip.
And then it shuts down areas that it isn't using,
so it's not one of these discussions about trading off performance against efficiency.
They're giving you both basically...
The current processes do that a little bit,
but they'll turn off certain parts of the processor.
Especially video cards didn't do that.
But yeah, there was some conference out somewhere,
and I guess you know West Coast was a big conference.
I forget which one it was.
One of the main things was either the BDC or New York Times
or somebody had an article on it.
I just didn't get a chance to really look at it.
Yeah, it is exactly.
As a matter of fact, they're saying they're basically expecting to push them
to either come up with another innovation
or make them a second choice.
But I'm never like those AMD processors because they do that.
They tend to fail.
The layers somehow peel apart.
Never trust a group of them.
To the unit system.
Not the system, but I guess it's the cash manor,
but it's right on the chip instead of a second thing.
That's over my head.
Most of that technical discussion is she on what I really know.
I'm trying to get someone to explain practically what I know is different in terms of quality.
They have undyped 2 or 3 finally.
They'll usually have, like, try to catch a fly.
Do you want to use a 16-toned undyped one?
Off the die.
We have the end of that.
Let me see if I can try this.
And I don't aim these.
I'm putting a memory controller in my chest right now.
So the AMD, it's got a direct interface to memory.
And then it's got another direct interface that goes out to the video card.
Or the cell phone.
So the AMD motherboards don't actually have a more original.
It's all great.
Do you like the launch mic?
Process.
Yeah, that would be great.
So do you want to do a thermal indication?
It's just a thermal.
And welcome.
If you're listening to you, probably already know that this is the O-Claire Linux user group.
And we are broadcasting live, single live, or in recording from Cafe4.
Hello.
Awesome.
All right.
Yeah.
It's great to work on this thing with you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
So Loch is up this week.
He's seeing the grandpaces inside the code.
He dropped off my audio stuff for me to use this week.
See?
How nice of you.
I always think to others.
All right.
I'm not a good media manager.
I've been here a lot lately.
There's a location in this thing.
Do you want to start at the end?
I'll go down this way.
I kind of pretty much told you what.
He was in the middle for this week with the keykits stuff.
Yeah.
That's pretty much so.
And somebody moves?
Yeah.
If somebody moves.
Introduce yourself.
Tell us what brings you here.
Okay.
I'm home or down.
I use Linux on my desktop.
My kids have learned how to operate.
I've been enjoying getting to know Linux.
Starting out with the Bernat and I.
Yeah.
Actually, I like that Linux.
I try not to install on the hard drive.
That was kind of fun to play with.
I'm putting it forward to release a Linux.
Yeah.
I'm still running.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, my desktop's I have dev-lyん systems on.
These guys talk with putting the bunch of annoying go left-talks.
Yeah.
They don't know what they're talking about.
They're awful.
How do they work for it?
It's okay.
The only thing that really doesn't work, you know, quite right is the, is the Webcam, which
We have a program that will work with it, but for some reason most of the webcam stuff
that we both do has in their normal distributions, some reason can't handle the palette, is
that why you, why the palette?
I actually saw something, and that is a very, very common palette for webcams, so it's
not the palette.
Yeah, what I want is that what I really wish I could use this panel hammer, because
we have a screen, and I've got that one that goes to an upload, so you can see the frame
things, and the guy who wrote the camera around me is reading, he's one of the still other
documentation, because he says that you have a palette problem right for him, he wants
to know about that, and I'm doing it, of course, I've read something, like webcams, and
I like, so they said that 60 to 70 seconds of webcams actually use that, why you, why
me?
I was surprised.
Yeah, I was surprised if you just work out of the box.
Maybe there's something else going on, yeah, that's it, because that's the one, with
that FS webcams, that's the only change I have to make, from all the default settings
to all the other things you use, and that immediately produces a picture.
So maybe, yeah, I'm thinking that maybe it's just not exactly right, but the software
actually supports it, but it faces another light from some reason, maybe something
new, right?
Yeah, good, good.
Well, I'll write you guys so as I get around to it, and you see what he's going to say.
So what did you hear about the group?
Well, I was a member of the Delta Billion, and he was a group, and he was a group, and
I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group, and I was a group,
And then a group, because I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group,
I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group,
and I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, I am a group, and I am a group, I am a group,
and I am a group, so I play around with, you know, from the program standpoint,
so that is very similar to using it for server as walk...
I mean, it seems to be tense to favor Ubuntu or at least he didn't I think he's actually moved off that
exclusive I mean I kidded him at first and he should call this the Ubuntu user
started I want to say he started with Susie and he liked it quite a bit I think it was the
yes academic year yes that he couldn't get used to and try to look lately those
and really frustrating yeah he didn't like the latest update you know
put the 804 seems to break some things for him but he didn't like the 3 player
the new tp file support for certain music players and I have to say it's all
the same with my wife so I don't know the player I was gonna put some iron made
nut and I don't go like I can't do anything I can plug it in I can drag files
out of it it's like it's copying in there but I don't know what it is
those were as far as reinstalling 710 yeah well that's what I still did this is 710
that I have on here I like that I do 710 works for me so I usually wait till
everybody solves the problems I have one cut of crazy cutting I let's see it's
sergeant and then it was Sid and then Lenny's the one waiting for what I have now
was kind of a hybrid of sergeant Sid and you know I do have problems with that
things are really stable but you know it's it's not a production machine it's
all a train layout for me so I like to fool around with it and see what works
true to form of in trying to move to something
yeah I never really used anything else
I think it's the next slide time I by buying so
So, what?
It's a little bit of a Linux out of the box.
I think it's a big deal.
Well, that's where I chose the 710 on this, because they're selling exactly this 1525
at the New York with the subjunctive system pre-installed, so I figured that was a good
match.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Harder than I thought.
It's somewhere to go.
Well, there's only one restricted driver here, really, which is that wireless, the broad
common wireless, but that's not actually always exactly the wireless that's on all these
computers.
They sell some different flavors of the same model, and some people have other cards on
there.
So, is there a one-on-one broadband that actually has those drivers that's going to want
to be only wireless, really?
Well, the Sun system, that Solaris system, the Broadcom drivers that came with that, worked
with the...well, it's not a wireless, but it's a beyond-board, right?
It's...it's a...it's gorgeous.
And it just works right out of the box.
It works right out of the box, so.
This one, I mean, it's like a work better box than a work.
You mean Windows, you can find anything you want to buy.
Even now it doesn't.
I just hold it in the box.
Oh, no, that's the...
I can't understand.
I can't understand tracking down drivers that get it to work.
That's right.
That's the whole idea that Windows, everything works out.
It's such a myth.
Yeah.
It's not true.
It's a myth.
Yeah.
That's the whole idea that Windows, everything works out.
It's such a myth.
It's not true.
It's a myth.
It comes packing for your hardware.
And especially with Vista, especially with Vista, they didn't have drivers for all kinds of things.
People were complaining about low drivers.
It's just always...
Yeah.
With cables, you know.
I always hear these.
Oh, how hard is it to install Windows?
Oh, Linux is so hard to install.
People should have been installing it.
Linux, but nobody ever focuses on that.
Oh.
Linux, I put into this a lot of way.
I'll come back.
What I know what I'm doing because I had to do it so often.
There's a lot of things.
I could say it's actually had no other way.
All the other places to do it.
Whether you've got it, or you've got it.
I'm going to start...
Network card, I don't think enough.
And there's a different computer to get on the internet.
Yeah.
I always brought that with a desktop machine.
You did play the...
It's built into the motherboard.
When Windows came in, the old network drivers.
The game was like the...
Any 2000 driver.
And that's it.
Yes.
If one did any other type of network say you could get on the internet
and download the other drivers.
Get on the internet and download the drivers.
And before they choked your eyes, that was hard.
Get it on a floppy.
You can put the floppy in.
Oh, a bad sector.
Okay.
I guess I'll go back and do it.
I guess I didn't save it on the PC.
I hope I didn't do it again.
Oh, man.
Yeah, I guess so we're going to...
Affirmative.
Distributions.
I'm trying really hard to move to Susie for some reason.
Something about it.
They have a funny smile system.
They have a funny arrangement for the file system.
It's a little bit different.
Anything that is set up to build on Susie,
you end up having to completely redo the make file
before you can build successfully on heavy and urban facilities.
There's a whole lot of stuff in it.
A whole directory too.
Or, you can use it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I was actually trying to play with another VerilIV4.
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Listen stuff like this.
I like it a lot.
If I work well,
you can actually think of anything.
Okay.
You see?
Right.
We're listening!
Can you read the old one?
BAC.
Yeah, I kind of like it really does.
Can you read it?
You just can't get it.
Right here is where it is.
What was the letter about to see the paint for the CDs?
Oh, it sounds like they're going to be something more expensive.
I think they're expected.
Dollar, dollar, thirty for CD.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be a combination.
You can hold on to any beers and I'm going to go in there.
I know where you actually go.
One penny per beer is fine.
Do you want to look at this?
It's familiar.
Yeah, I see problems.
Yeah.
You have names on your laptop.
I do.
You like names.
I haven't taken it off, and I spent it here for like two months.
It's so long ago.
It's like all year.
It probably is.
So, you're a license or is it managed at me?
A little bow on it.
It's good.
And this is too tired to put the new one.
That's awesome.
Let me just move that forward.
It's basically, it's built on top of a bone tube, or they took a bone tube and they decided to refine it, so it was supposed to have like the best soft hair.
You've got all your codex and smoothness software yet.
Yeah, what was it? There should be almost something particular they were saying that it should be a fully featured operating system.
I just think it's very green.
It's very green and yellow.
We can make it blind.
Yeah, they have, by default, I don't know lots of these.
The guy's name is Klemmy's from Ireland.
Oh god.
It's like one guy.
Why they're mostly of these guys?
Yeah, you need this.
By default, I actually like a wild mate, just the first dark thing that actually,
as well as the dark thing.
And I just, a little close to Mr.
Yes.
Yes.
I believe it's from the Aurora GTK engine, which I cannot get to run properly if I install it myself.
But for whatever they've done here, it makes you fine and when it's made, it's just built in, so.
But if I install the Aurora engine myself, it doesn't hurt.
He writes here.
Can you see that?
Yeah.
I'm surprised he can't find himself a sugar daddy up at his place at the point or something.
Don't you think?
The three that used to find all kinds of people to fund these kinds of things.
But Jill Wilesly used to work pretty hard at that, maybe.
I don't know.
Or where is how much trouble he went to to get that stuff.
Just keep bothering him.
Works for children.
Yes.
Most people are angry.
You've asked him to be born boy.
You know what?
He will hang here.
These lights.
I haven't had them working much for years now.
They're good.
They have pretty good business.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I thought it was reverted to a favorite building.
Oh.
It was pure waste.
Today, it looks nice.
And they wanna be reverted through, also.
And they run for $15,000.
And then, when you're living on an healthcare level
in this mart of government
I don't know if you can hear it or not.
Yeah, I want to try it somewhere.
I don't know if you can hear it or not.
In fact, I usually really speak about this.
I think it's probably more, what the hell is that?
You can hear it out of brain.
You can hear it out of brain.
It's not really.
You're not sure how to do it.
I think there's an option out too.
What?
Let's start about the CDs for you and get this.
Oh, yeah, that's about something called free.
Freedom software day?
Free software day?
Free software freedom day.
So he's organizing this little thing at the public library
where they're going to have some CDs to give out and brochures
to inform people about the availability of free software,
whether you're doing it in Linux or any other operating system, really.
And it's a national thing.
There's a website for the software freedom days.
It's just basically trying to promote the idea of open source.
Yep.
Elliot's working on the pamphlet here.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
It's double.
Yeah.
You post that on the homepage of the group.
Yeah.
The group thing.
I thought it looked pretty good.
I don't know if you were going to do something.
I don't know if you were going to do something.
I don't know if you were going to do something.
I don't think that something should count too hard on us
because that's bad timing for us sometimes like that.
I'm definitely interested in happening.
I think it's a really good thing.
I think it's probably a few of us.
Probably three of us to ship.
It's going to be open.
Oh, it's not like we're going to have a bank.
It's just like a book.
Yeah, the library, the policy at the library
is that they can't give us a room,
but we could be outside, you know,
in front there and then hand out pamphlets.
And they're also willing to have a,
they have several things inside
where they have information areas where people,
you can leave brochures and posters and things like that
and people to see that come and go.
But for some reason,
cannot say it's in an actual affiliation
with you for something like that.
I don't know either.
It's just a door that I'm having to leave.
Yeah, you know, the Ku Klux Klaners,
somebody who want to do the same thing next weekend
and say, don't allow that.
It didn't make much sense to me.
I would say in the future,
the recommendation would be that you might get,
you might have to work harder to get it,
but you might make the more headway
if you put the time into it going over to the university
for something like that.
They're not really interested in becoming an umbrella
for a group like this,
and free net, they never were willing to take that step
with that, but they were opening more facilities
than the public libraries for some of our activities.
So, but it was harder to get to that point, you know.
And actually, I think with Mimi not being the head of reference,
not being quite as easy to swing at that time either.
I think that was kind of a foot in the door there, so.
But I think, you know, in the long run that might pay off,
you might have a better, a better audience
for something like that over there.
I'm just going to use them for private meetings,
but not something like that.
Not where you go.
I think that's why.
I think that's why.
That'll be cheaper to print.
Could you take a little bit of our work on it?
Okay.
That's it.
Oh, I started with it.
And then I, you remember,
I was just going to put it down.
And then it went to the stopments.
And.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Right off.
Okay.
So we're just going to have a, like, a stable,
a stable, a stable sitting on the side,
but CDs on it and brochures to more open source software
and free software, okay?
Okay.
Check it out.
Yes.
Open source software.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I noticed that.
Yeah.
I was in with the list.
I didn't understand everything you were going to do.
A lot of focus.
A lot of focus.
It's not easy for you to get somebody to see you and stay here.
Yeah.
All of this is all free.
Yeah.
And it frees, like, a magic word, you know,
clearly.
You would notice, like, you know, whenever these guys get on
the news program to announce their activities, like,
the third word out of their mouth is, and it's free.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Having.
You.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey.
Thank you for being the deeply obnoxious.
And getting those people on the window.
Or they have.
Or,
or this dreams of będzie going
down.
Oh yeah.
That's that you know we have.
The up.
The coach has the server with the home page for the group
group on it makes you give you the URL for that and then there's also a Yahoo's
group that you know message board and Google and and file section and stuff
so you know you can sort of see what things are going on look at it
but yeah actually that's yeah I used the original version I had a one-way
it's getting a lot better
it's filled with features I don't know how long will it be or try to go away
but if it really has come a long way with the features
just try it recently and it looks pretty decent
the most I was in close to what I tried it and I had the features but I had to show
it to be working all of a sudden your canvas and it would change your
like furnace 100,000 pounds so sit there, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, back to the
canvas you're in for another 5 minutes so I didn't notice that this is so it looks like it's really
coming along it's made a lot better so I mean maybe you could take a look at it again
might be the point where it's useful
I've got the graph there actually did most of that need state and then I was going to
do more of that little stress try to put in the next thing else over time
Rose Garden is not there's not ever windows mine
no I'm pretty sure not actually
it's like goodness I mean once you see that 4 grams of battery
I think that is the most it is so hard to do the simplest things
well I mean just simple things like just go like have something
playing off a nitty device that you want to plug in and just simply record the
nitty device you know you have to go through a whole process of setting a nitty device
and I mean it's it's just too much there it's just too much there it's just
anything I mean you know any any device is playing back a nitty file if you want to take
particular channel out or something it's so you can read it in music or something like that
you know it just becomes I offer a lot of pull down menus and button clicks to get to the point
where you can just sing a lot of that one channel and report it you know it's it's I mean
it's it works well but the user interface I think is it's so complicated compared to what I'm
used to using like the sonar and windows or something like that where you can very easily set
those kinds of things up I don't know I guess I don't really have a problem or you
just pretty much mark the track go go and get placed place through the track use for more nitty
and it goes to have a track those are less okay then for rose garden what
developed a lot recently or is it uh
I thought it was very similar like a cake block or so
they had mine first well but I didn't I didn't yeah I didn't do a group of the interface is
complicated things aren't you know where you expect them to be I I'm finding very complicated
what you're used to it it might be just what I'm used to
the next line with uh the kosher doesn't do maybe stuff right now but it's really simple
and it took me forever to figure out how to do the simple things because I was used to it
once you get used to it you're like wow that's kind of strange
yeah
once your intuition is shifted what once it assimilates you then it becomes
it just seems that all a lot of stuff stays up on the desktop all the time that you can't get rid
of it whereas like in cakewalk and sonar and stuff you can collapse the parts of it that you're
not okay okay I'll give you that one I have to see when you got a guitar and you've got
a guitar and you know when you got a guitar in your lap and use it over here and a keyboard
for input here you start fooling around you have to worry about the mouse and what your nose
is pressing on and so on and so forth you know it gets a little bit calm that's what I mean by
the audio software is hard to manage on one screen yeah you can get a mixing board
to the tracks our door is just or all on screen it's completely unuseful that's about huge
resolution I uh there aren't there's a couple jack plug-ins I can't even use and 12
lady by amp here because you can't use it because you can't get all the buttons so
but like when I've used our door on here I'll make you know four virtual best
comps now put the mixer over here which you can do but it's it's kind of a pain to flip back and
forth between your workspace and you can't use a pan you know maybe guys are using
on this
yeah
what is the day today September
So we're looking for not as much as $3.00 or $3.00.
Unless we can find a place that isn't cheap for our company.
The less flows this gear is very, very good.
Yeah.
It's still the beer.
It's still the beer.
It's amazing to be here.
Yeah, he's got a good start for the price.
I actually have a series like the screen.
You can take it on a little bit.
Oh, he's making up that email side.
It doesn't actually have white CD.
Oh!
Is that he doesn't printed himself or he does printed with the materials.
We use white inkjet, printable media, the clear pump.
That's the correct amount.
It's going to be $1.00.
Is that just for printing?
No.
Is it a dollar per disk or a dollar per printed?
It's for printing.
No, I think it's $1.00.
It's a duplicated graph.
Let me see if you can look at it.
$1.00 or $3.00.
It's good to stay local.
I think that's, I'm glad he's staying local.
You're looking to be a local text editor.
I think I think that does mean that it's a dollar per disk.
No, but it sells all the top.
The duplicated and print 100 CDs.
Yeah.
$1.00 or $2.00.
I mean, that sounds like it's everything.
Here's your CD.
Okay, or two?
Maybe we could talk him into it.
It doesn't sound good.
It sounds like that his left is.
Maybe he could sponsor it, but he wasn't going to do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would give him some advertising.
Yeah.
He might go for that.
He might need some help.
He'll keep himself aware of something.
I mean, you know, you can think of some kind of trade, you know,
things like that.
Wow.
I'm sure he'll take it if you believe me.
I'm just a few test CDs that will run for himself.
But yeah, you might talk to him about some kind of trade, you know,
for some sort of service or something.
You'll pay more for that.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
I can make something.
I've got a magic marker for it.
Yeah, really.
That's the thing, too.
You know, you could just duplicate the CDs and pen something on it.
I mean, I could just make one standard one and then I made like five six copies.
I could get five six people with colored pencils and I could just duplicate crayons.
You could just take our laptops or desktop up to the table in front of the library
and ask people to meet them and burn them and see them.
Bring your CD and burn you one.
I don't think so much that he was willing to ship in a fair chunk of this.
I think he was looking for other people.
I don't think he took his laptop.
Who's the best guy?
Who's the best guy?
Kurt, listen, here's one.
Anyone in the chat room?
No, about 10 more seconds.
Yeah.
The screen catches up.
Now we also do an IRC chat.
It was a free no chance.
If you're less staying in your nut, you know, IRC.
I think there's a link in our website.
Yeah, I'll just fill it in and give a shout out.
I tried running SMCE.
How did that go?
I made the work to install them, but it's not really free yet.
SMCE is that the...
Is that the same warning that goes for the XBOX and reports it?
Or well, reports it?
It's the UPS installation.
What was that supposed to do with home automation?
Oh, well, that's the home automation.
So there's a lot in the market.
There's a good demo of what happened on our launch.
Is that the X10 stuff?
Yes, yeah.
That's the only advanced thing.
The more, the more you could tell it, the more it's good.
It's got the media center filled in.
If you build your own security system using it,
where then it'll actually call you,
go back with motion sensing.
Motion sensing.
If someone has forced open the door thing,
you don't actually do the demo.
The demo, you can actually do that with the intruder in your house.
Would you like to one?
One, please.
Two, cancel.
Three, talk to me, intruder.
Three, that's awesome.
You have your demo and it's three.
Get out of my home.
It's just like that work points.
Yeah, we wouldn't let freak you out, though.
It would.
I'd be out of there.
I don't know.
He said, I'm watching you.
Get out of my home.
Maybe better if he said something like,
sit down right here.
If you dare, you got my joke.
There really was some interesting stuff.
Oh, yeah.
There's a lot.
But it's going to look before it's on.
You wouldn't use media.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Actually, it's just a part of it.
Myth door.
Myth door is probably one of the better or the best institutions.
I think the key, though, is the blind hardware that actually works.
Well, it's a one of the chapter projects.
I don't want to do that.
If you're just playing, I've already recorded the part.
I run air to see since it has been mentioned this,
but I don't know what to do.
I run air, but I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
And it's also kind of neat.
It's got like streams that have been introduced to the Internet radio.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this is the Internet radio.
A lot.
In the 49s, it's got a few favorite streams and a seven month.
Maybe that's where we go.
I'm not sure.
I didn't work on it.
I didn't work on it.
I didn't work on it.
I didn't work on it.
It was on this time.
You were right.
It was set to 33.
I was doing a full record.
I didn't work on it.
Yeah.
So it doesn't take long.
I was really, I guess, impressed with it.
Last week, I tried what we recorded the Olympus,
and I tried making the DDL.
And I thought I had the many options.
I made DDE.
Okay.
What type of menu system do you want?
I want that one.
Okay.
I want to fit four hours on a one DDE.
Go.
Good.
Yeah.
Putting the seat.
Putting the DDE.
There's DDD.
Second, the DD player.
And full menu system.
And everything.
It looks great.
I mean, it started off inside now.
I had that recording button.
Yeah.
I made a really nice DD.
No problems.
It just worked right out of my sight.
I thought I would get one of the things to do.
It should just be simple.
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
you actually use the DDM to get a job.
It's so hard to do.
It might be just the DD.
Because I know the DD2 starts off
with just ugly sleep.
You could have a match.
But that's really nice to work with.
DD2 and DD.
And it just...
It's not pretty.
But they have nice ones.
That's the ones.
That's the ones.
That's the ones.
And I can burn them on after-business.
We're just going to get a stall on it.
I can.
And I can make all of them up on them
for a few minutes.
Something good is where they're going.
I don't know how many of you guys would be interested
in this little topic.
But I found this video on this project
from the University of Washington.
And I don't know.
They have a lot more of it.
It's amazing.
It's easy for us to do these videos.
You can take more quality,
more resolution videos.
It's really plugged in.
It's just hidden in the URL.
It's kind of wild.
It's...
You know, it's good.
It's heard up in the chat.
Yeah, put it in the chat.
There you go.
I have to learn how to do that.
For some reason, I have a podium
with IRC.
I just...
It seems so strange to me
to converse with people that way.
I've been forced into doing it
with some tech support stuff.
And I've managed to stumble my way through that.
But I just find it very uncomfortable.
It's the same thing with e-mail.
It's just a completely different situation
from talking to someone.
Yeah, well, I have no trouble adjusting the e-mail, I guess.
Well, e-mail is different than IRC.
Yeah.
Every one of those is just...
One person might come off one way.
Yeah.
The person is completely different in e-mail.
That's what I don't like about it.
That's what I'm talking to people on the phone,
or you know, I won't talk.
Yeah.
The phone is the same thing.
The phone is, I can handle a little bit.
You know, I can't handle a thing.
It's fun with the phone.
And then I can't handle a construction before
it's not a funeral.
I'm saying...
What up the way left?
Uh, because I said about the same thing.
If you go through the snow,
all the sports there's snow.
Do we have snow?
Exactly.
It's definitely worth watching.
It's incredible.
It's incredible.
It's just amazing.
It's amazing.
Right forward.
Yeah.
To make sure that you see...
And then the source code is available also.
So there are no videos.
Okay.
Wow.
I mean, you still can't understand what's going on.
Mm-hmm.
We've got some.
I mean, I'm trapped.
I'm just gonna put it back.
I think I have a higher resolution than I thought it was.
But it's...
So there, they're enhancing the frame renaissance.
I think using this...
That actually models the scene.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I'm going to hit it in the middle of the tree, I'm going to hit it in the middle of the tree, I'm going to hit it in the middle of the tree, it's sort of makes you wonder when you look at the Realty listing institute, you know?
Yeah, inside the frames, preserving the reflections, isn't that like I, it's hard to believe
that that's actually possible. All they had to go was to say, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you can take people out of the scene, you

that's what I was wondering how that works.
I consistently found that these particular Polish DVDs don't decode
and I can't see any difference between them and they play on the player absolutely
normally they don't cause that little thing to kick up where you have to change your
you know country designation they don't kick that up and you cannot get it you cannot get a read
of a seat you know we'll not extract the CSS keys all I want to do for those regions is to go to law
hard to be violent and $20 can be a new player from China it's too cheap to have the mockdown
so we just have one and nine at the same time okay it's a lot so we yeah we don't have an
original code after you need one if you've got a more expensive one than mine but
we're cheap it's worth a lot of money because this time we're both that's the code we're good
for that particular player who's up on maybe about 30% there's a special code you can
enter in the one line is the region you know it's a complete this is a company region
just some kind of old age type of remote man will just say okay for a lot you can play with
a region just in one but what I'm saying to you that pretty much it's just a little yeah we just
do a model because we have a new international home China
what did you google for that guy I have a cousin yeah I have a cousin who's an archaeologist and
he's always going back and forth between Karee and here and he's discovered that limit of
number of times you can change it back and forth it's rather upset about it so I don't really
keep a cyber home TV player just we don't like the $20 ones but I wanted to see
okay yeah I have to google that up to send it to Steven
you know it's it's the company itself you know like there might be a website
in China where they don't care the sailgakers how you lock it eventually filters through
makes it's way to the website so somebody can come and say it's always going to lock it in there
so our video is interesting but I actually did buy their
Kodak pack for a while so it's super fun so what did they do um it's uh you get to
like empty free support it before it's 260 free is it and there's media so like a couple times
they installed the door on here and just going to strip to install the do I go to Kodak
everything except for TV it's a common switch and I think it's it's 30 bucks at the entire
it's all it's worth it that's why I'm using wish mint now because mint comes with
the stuff that you actually go to like a minute room to get exactly not moving or not
technically
like the fluna kodak store thank you for using it I don't think we can set it up
yeah okay we'll play a video but we're off time to talk and lock out the player
I've never been locked up with player but I noticed I think I've noticed that the quality
difference especially if you think the difference between the design back end
or the g-string or back end I think it's a huge difference you get both better
quality and design back end and it's the atmosphere considering everything on a g-string
what did you say or did that doesn't seem very stable to us then player plays everything
but it's not quite stable the design doesn't quite fit it's really stable
these strings
Is it like a magross?
No I like VLC too
I didn't think I could just never found that bandwagon, so I wouldn't hang in there.
Well, you know what I mean?
I agree with you.
I agree with you.
I personally like the BLC's between employer and sign, and if the user and your friends
is ever calling, it's a sin.
You come back to the money, too, and it's a sin.
First, I think the BLC is a great thing.
It's usually good.
Why can't somebody come up with a nice design from the employer?
What people want is just ugly, crap and crap.
It's just, they try and make it look like you.
You know, you see, the seabird, you know, giant or something.
No, there is playbots.
Playbots in the slider.
It's a flash.
That's great.
First class.
It's a little thing I think I like it more.
So, it's like pretty fun, isn't it?
So, it's what men use it.
All right.
So, level later, I don't know.
I think it was just, maybe I should work with it for a while.
I think it would most mention the level later before.
I think what it's supposed to is just take an audio recording.
It's going to be leveled out.
You might be making it in here at the worst.
Probably.
You could process our recordings from here.
It would be easier to hear.
Probably not.
Yeah, it's this compression, sure.
Yeah.
We're processing all the lines.
I'm pretty sure it is.
Particularly.
I just think a lot of it might change.
DHP4.
I put it in interesting DHP quite a while ago.
But I don't know if I'm putting it in here.
Usually, Java person.
4 is coming to end of life.
Anyone look at these other ones?
Almost don't look at these stop cycles.
Well, they can be flash battered.
It's easier to start the recording.
You know that's one thing.
Don't you flash still sucks.
It is sucks for a long time.
I think that would fix this.
They come out with a new version.
And it's no better than a previous version.
It's no worse, but no better.
It's not the faster version.
Where is the 64 bit?
64 bit is camera on for six, seven years now.
And they're just completely boring yet.
Whenever anybody says anything about it,
it would be difficult to say to them that
cross-platform is 64 bit.
No.
If you can do a cross-platform,
do it in 64 bit.
Should be as easy as we're compiling it.
Unless you don't know what you're doing on your program.
And seriously, I went from a 16 bit program
to 32 bit program.
And it took me one more.
That was it.
And I was done.
I was like, one, two, three.
It had changed.
It was really simple.
And this is a slouching program.
And this is pretty good.
So they just...
I don't know if they're just boring yet.
Or they just don't know if they're doing it.
They've got a lot of assembly language,
which they should have.
It's just that I can't understand how they can be standing still.
So still.
And letting everybody catch up to it.
And that part I'll have.
I don't like this waiting for Feta,
the APN at the market,
once you have come,
pops up there.
And the bottom one.
Yeah.
Done.
Wait.
There it is again.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's the latest thing.
It's waiting for me to click on it.
It's going to go off the window.
I noticed that on the other side.
It always stopped on one side.
What is the second?
It'll look up.
It's like some spam side.
They just happen to hold their stuff on the same side.
Yeah, that was the one good thing about Windows.
You could find the DLL that was doing that,
and believe it.
And then it would say,
DLL fails to load.
You know?
Not really.
He's like, you're out of your mind.
That was the last thing.
Oh, so, I was trying to go to HGTV.
It was good last week.
They must have changed their site,
but my wife was trying to go there the week
and anything flashed,
and I was just paying for it.
They had some flashed in there.
It was just, yeah.
But he went to something that flashed my post.
I don't like they changed their site.
That was a really impressive flash,
and the first doctor in Skullsford
played up Willamstall on six of the organises.
And from the metal,
like you probably know me.
And they're in Skullsford.
Yeah.
They could be anywhere.
And then they've got some frequencies
that are breaking in Skulls
and we're a lot of different people.
Like they're requiring whole versions of actors
that were never honored in Skullsford.
Because they're so old.
So, and it's cold here.
They could get the skuller
and they could create these data
or even though they said that
it's getting frequencies
or one of the things that they've done before.
So it's just not a good situation.
They need to do something,
because the video on the web is huge.
Our flash starts going down the tube.
What else is going to take?
Yeah, but what is it going to take?
Yeah.
Yeah, Adobe's never been friendly with Linux.
That's what I'm saying.
The Adobe's deeper,
right?
Okay.
All right.
I did actually read some of the Pandora
can't make money properly.
Yeah, it's internet radio.
And there's something about here,
but the world is that internet radio stations
are having to pay
to some sound exchange.
I'm not sure where it's going to take.
It doesn't, it's the same thing going on with Linux.
But they, are they making money?
Well, the last of it comes basically the same.
So really, are they going under?
I haven't heard from them.
They're not based on the U.S.
So they might, uh,
make people think away from you.
The last thing I was actually based on,
they're up somewhere.
No, you can't or whatever.
This is a sound exchange.
Okay.
This is, yeah.
This has been going out for quite a while.
They took upon themselves
to charge money for all,
um,
I guess, I hate it in my sense of artists.
Regardless of whether the artists
say they want the world to be like,
or not,
this company is just blanking for everyone.
Just because they're the company
and they say they can't.
So any re-evaluation of the broadcast,
anything that's, uh,
anything on the ASC,
or where they're asking.
Ask out them.
Anything that's under that,
the broadcast is one thing under it
for charging for that re-evaluation
for all the signs of the plant.
Regardless of why there isn't so much energy
before it has to be challenged.
Because they're the designated company
uh, they're the government designated
now as a company.
The reason for any of those,
the reason for any of those court challenges
is the simple things.
You know, the sheriff's got ten guns
and you've got one gun.
Do you want to get into the gun battle with this guy?
You know what I mean?
It's the safe thing for these guys
have much more money to throw,
it's stopping you,
than you have to challenge them.
It's just, it's just,
it's the same story.
Any of the laws
that you do down there,
side there like,
okay, this one,
you don't want everyone
going out collecting drugs.
So,
this one company gets to do it all.
And then the company gets to be,
you know,
the artist's a percentage
you want big life.
It's virtually nothing there.
Pretty much just collecting money
coming in,
and you know,
it's just a lot of areas.
Just, last defend any advertisement
on their side,
for any of these schools.
You have the thing in his articles
that Pandora apparently
doesn't,
never put advertising.
They did, actually.
They did have,
just small,
not advertising.
There wasn't any,
ever,
wasn't ever any commercials
on the air.
You never had to listen to anything.
Just occasionally,
it would pop up,
it would add some form.
A lot of really,
too, like,
you know,
one thing they,
they kind of went after Pandora,
not after them,
but they said, you know,
at the end here,
they,
just filled it
and we'll figure out
if there's a business model
later for which
we'll be able to say
it's an expensive list.
And they were kind of
a lot of,
they're lack of using ads
in the beginning.
Those kind of big things,
a lot of people figure
that you had tons
and tons and tons of track
if there was going to be a wait
this morning,
and a lot of people
really couldn't pick that second step out.
Yeah,
who's trying to,
why don't we use it more?
There's many ads trying to,
except two,
yeah, except two.
One other thing,
well, last event is,
it might be different is,
they don't just go out
and get the music,
they wait for the people
who will use it.
Old music,
because you know,
you say,
okay,
let's do it.
But they,
they are,
just music.
Well, that's just too much music,
though.
Right, I think they're,
they're talking directly
with the,
copyright holdings of the music.
You want the music out?
The copyright holdings
says, yes.
Well, that's just too,
what they said that I can do it.
That's the thing
that's going to turn this
all around,
because artists are finding
that the publicity
is way more valuable to them,
than money that it comes in
at an early stage,
where they end up being
completely victimized
by agents and things like that
who sign them up,
you know,
because you're so desperate to work,
you know,
you want to be able to get your stuff
out there,
at the early stages,
you agreed anything,
and then you regretted
for the rest of your life,
you know,
or the rest of your career,
anyway, you know.
And, but the thing
that's going to change it around
is so many music,
especially musicians,
have found that getting
their work out there,
anyway, they can,
is worth much more to them,
than, you know,
income at an early stage.
I think that's been
changed the way that's,
it was moving that way,
but not as many people
on my stage
that have their own
poorly made
or poorly used to be,
or as well.
Yeah.
Well, well, well,
production value,
you're just getting
in a state of very good
and stuff like that.
Well, but that's always
been the case.
Yeah, exactly.
For a while there,
you can find some
really cool artists.
I agree.
I agree.
And then everyone else
kind of had the same idea
but they weren't quite as good.
Do you remember
the original MP3.com?
Yeah.
But anybody,
no, not that straight up,
original,
the original MP3.com.
I think so.
You could put the site
for artists to upload there.
Oh, yeah.
It's tough.
They have music ratings
and how many people
listen to music.
You could actually
create a CD,
you could put a CD together
and sell it and they
would make the CD
and send it to someone
who bought it for their
work.
So you actually
be an artist
with no down there.
Well, that's true.
It was.
I thought it was really
cool.
And I was in a band
that could create
the total of a couple of
CDs and campaigns.
Yeah.
They would never.
It was interesting.
I don't know if they could
support themselves.
The music industry
would never let that happen
because they make
that's caught me
cutting down the leak.
Yeah.
That's it.
Well, it's no more
than what they can do.
What you're talking about
about the glut of
information,
where you can't
plow through the garbage.
That's true
unless you're looking
at a focused thing.
If you have a more
focused idea,
like you're interested
in, you know,
Celtic music
played on the
herty-gurty or something
like that.
And you start searching
those particular niche
interests,
not just kind of like
what's cool now
or what's popular now.
And you don't have
that, you know,
completely too much,
you know, information
ultimately.
Like I said,
they were going to be
free.
I don't know.
And it sounds like
a big thing.
I always do.
I love it.
I thought it was great,
man.
Well, thank you.
You could get that
filtering strategy.
Yeah.
I mean, it has to be
working for something
particular or something
that's doing
that's not the music
industry because it takes
the control out of their hands.
They basically
music industry decides
from this topic.
But that's what.
That's why we're
listening to music.
I mean, in the 1960s or
70s, we were not, you know,
at the snack bar,
we were not listening to
the music that my parents
listened to during the war.
And everybody today
that puts on almost any
commercial radio station
is listening to music
that we were listening
to in the snack bar
when we were in college.
That's an
unusual situation.
I mean, the music
industry has just
collapsed on their own
weight of exactly this kind
of stuff of idiots
deciding what's good.
Yeah.
And it just can't
continue that way.
Because there's
talented people out there
who want to do interesting
stuff.
So they're moving into
little niche kind of things
where they're
pursuing particular, you
know,
kinds of music.
And they're kind of
focused on that.
And if you go looking
for those focused things,
you don't have
information over them.
And I think it may
not be overnight.
Popularity is
very lucky.
What?
When you instead
popularity, I mean,
that's the point.
When you don't know
what you're looking for,
that's more fun.
That's the point.
You want more people
who do know what they're
looking for.
But you do want people
who are doing something
interesting.
They'd rather have
10,000 really long
million listeners
than a million people
who are blowing hot one
a week and cold the
next pool thing that comes
along.
Unless you have the
backers of some
big company that are
going to make you
sooner than you are.
You don't need that.
This looks like
you're a child.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
I think that's the way
you get to work.
I think that's the way
we get to work.
Right.
We get to work.
We get to work.
I really do a...
I really do a...
you really do a...
you really do a...
you really do a...
you really do a...
you really do some things
you really do a...
I really do a...
You just say,
really...
You just say,
really do...
you áreas like
we put sounds like
we put sound like
we put sound like
we put sound like
So, go ahead and play that one.
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.
It's okay with me.
And then,
scroll down,
and usually, like, listen,
like, there's a crack.
And then, at least,
a little flab.
So, I'm sure we've gotten that, you know.
I think you look a little flash.
And then, like,
guys,
oh, not Dr. Wickey?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, I'm going to crash you there.
Oh, we'll get a visualization.
Can I lose something with you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think she said she likes it here.
She said she likes it here.
Maybe not, man.
I think that's the thing.
I mean, it's the central musician's power,
and all this is like a pre-achel,
strangles creativity.
Oh, man.
All right.
I'm going to check this out.
Yeah.
I don't know about that.
Like, that's the second one,
but playing the heavy metal,
you can take it out?
I can't look for it.
Hold it in the song.
Hold it in the song.
Hold it in the song.
Hold it in the song.
In a tender game cartridge,
it's got pictures.
Oh, man.
Do you remember the original music purposes?
I don't know.
To theỷ one.
Yeah.
Well, you don't have to, my room.
What is the speaker's ideas for view?
används.
Oh, I'm not going to be familiar with под Cuba.
Cashima.
I'm going to have to buy this.
This is the whole reason I finally have to leave.
in the middle for play all the old games, anyway so play all the old games and just turn that on
side track there.
It's all sound.
It's okay.
We did a lot of the bands on there that you just don't play.
You know, they get to play with me because there we go.
I've got one that's incredible.
That's probably myself.
I've never really heard of it.
Music education.
I didn't read this.
I didn't want to read it.
Let's say that I can just read it again.
I make sound to read it.
I don't know if you just got to get to it.
I don't know if you just got to get to it.
I don't know if you just got to get to it.
I don't know if you just got to get to it.
I don't know if you just got to get to it.

I don't know if you just got to it.
I don't know if you just got to hit this up.
I don't know.
Well, don't forget the new SoulFedge too, any of you folks who want to sharpen your music skills.
That's a very simple little program that trains you with rhythm patterns and intervals and chord recognition and stuff like that.
New SoulFedge. The SoulFedge is the old system, you know, where you learn to...
You're training, you know, perfect training towards perfect pitch and things like that.
Isn't that really...
What's what it's saying here? I don't know.
I don't know what this is though, but SoulFedge wouldn't teach you that. It does teach you to hear about her.
Well, no, this is what I would like to know.
Oh, this one that we're looking at.
Right. Well, that's what I was going to say here.
The theory should follow to explain what you hear.
If you learn the theory first, it's not the way to go about it.
You should learn music. When you hear something, you know how it goes. You can hear the notes, you can play the notes, you can play the rhythm.
Then maybe some theory will kind of help you go from there on your own, but...
Yeah, I mean, the old saying is that, you know, the supreme misfortune is when theory outstrips practice.
Every musician ever worked really well.
Too much theory. It's been my opinion then.
Yeah, absolutely.
I know what I want to do, but I can't do it.
There's plenty of people who know theory who are fantastic.
It's too restricted.
Plus, it's definitely easy learning the theory.
It's the point theory, and when you're going to find those patterns,
coming up with something creative.
The theory does a very poor job of explaining most of the best music.
I mean, music is much more subtle than that.
And it really does a poor job.
It's really a great aspect of music.
It's not as far away as theory.
It's really a new breaking book, it's right.
First, musical engineers.
One of the most famous elements of all of them is the solid music publishing.
And then on to something like that.
So...
How about you change it?
I don't know.
Banshee.
Anyone use Banshee?
Come to it, Susie.
What is it?
It's a big A with a box.
Oh, I tried that.
I'm a great music player.
That's good.
People circle.
You can find it on their own box.
What around it?
That's a song for Banshee.
Whatever.
Right back of the box.
It's kind of like somethings where Banshee and when they're saying it's getting better,
and it does point videos.
It's almost more like...
I don't think there is an media player instead of an audio player with the songs of it.
It's similar to that for real.
I don't know.
I don't know why people get so overwhelmed with these media players.
But because when I arrive late at day three,
and media players have been touching my MPs to try something,
I'd be pretty tired.
I think I can want that.
I was very pissed off at it.
Yes.
It's very annoying to have an MP for example.
I'm sure you've been.
You've got to change.
No, you can either hand off it.
You can't absolutely hand off it.
Because I spend half an hour trying to turn it off.
No, you can't.
No, you can't.
Yeah, you can make a real one of the thoughts that's going to win you.
But it's really annoying when I have all my,
and if you check this inversion for one of our programs,
and I play it on a media player,
and all of a sudden,
Oh, it's changed.
That wasn't great.
I don't like people.
You don't touch my stuff without asking.
Exactly.
That was my problem with the iPod stuff.
That was terrible.
You didn't ask me.
Who knows if they want the DR right in there?
I mean, seriously.
I hope that was a good production.
Can we guarantee that it's not worth it out?
I mean, who knows what it is?
I don't know what it is.
I know what I'll think of the ID three days gone down.
Can we guarantee that it's not worth it out?
Good argument for open source.
Yeah.
But we took a break.
We took a break.
Thank you, Steve.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
What I did was I just installed a pad player
and we download all the SSDs playing in that.
I'm like, I don't want to deal with it.
Here's the other one.
Can we get it?
Absolutely.
Can we agree?
Look at GL3.
We're going to get you in one hand.
We're trying to do a regular triangle.
Okay.
We'll come try it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whoa.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I look through the pictures. Oh, yeah, they talk spoke to you so
Well, I can say to me good thing this was under five hundred bucks
I don't know like Cooper under five hundred bucks. I'm okay
Then my bell is in such tires, right?
We have to wait for the pictures to begin
They're just doing this to help
Well, I guess what most was interesting is that they're doing the Linux
Hey
A couple years ago they were making some nice laptops and I bought this based on the fact that the P3
laptop I had is a wonderful machine except getting a little slow now
So I bought this in the quality difference between just the plain hardware and stuff in it
Topped that with the piece of crap listed that they put on there
So that's the fact that when I bought those extra hard drives and they sent me the carriage and the hard drive and didn't send me the screws
Then it cost me $17 to go buy 12 screws from them so I can install the damn thing
That you know, so anything bad that happens to Dell at this point. I say
Why is it so hard?
That's the thing we don't tell our only its favorite joke about it said what windows xp you're better. So I bought a map
Okay, I'll give you that yeah
I expect hard and they're not as good as they used to be
I mean if you really think about the state of the hardware generally and say when the
2ci or something like that was coming out. I mean, or what was that one that was the holy grail of the graphics machines?
I forget what model that was
You know, it's like it was like a $10,000 Mac in the toward the end of the 80s
That was really well made piece of equipment
I got a performer born was I was sorry. I did that, you know, I mean
Because just even in the space of about five years the quality of
They don't test the stuff together. They put in sound card
Okay, give your car from then then the
Oh
The story generally with that was when they came into this thing they called just in time
Supply or just in time shit. The problem was they were never able to get enough of any particular components
To actually make all the machines the same
So they always ended up having to have a design where they had so much fudge room that they could
Slide the equipment's a little bit this way in that way now gateway tries to solve part of that problem by contracting
Separately with a lot of these people for you know what they needed and they would
Use some of their stuff that they had to make one certain way because of the limited supply chain
And they would just design their machine with those particular components and why but look what happened the gateway
They weren't able to sustain that over time that that whole supply you know method of approaching design both now
So
Works everything's fantastic together. It's got all links or everything or just work
But you can you can you can you can't even paint for college now. That's right
Even if you're willing to pay you know
That's right. I mean there are quality. They're not tough line, but you can find stable
But then you're you're rolling the dice too because one might be stable in the next one might have different different
If you're looking at parts you can get stable you can get quality hardware if you build it yourself. Yeah
Well, yeah, but then you also
But you also have that all all the machines that really work well that are commercially produced are tuned
So if you even if you do your own roll your own you better have to know how in the equipment to tune it
After you get the thing put together because the components will not just work together
They so there's no work at all
You know there's so many things these days you have to look for like as you as you're
You know your motherboard support the
The extra features of your
Your video card because now all the different brands video cards have their own
You know upgraded features that are supposedly made you work better with the
You know the special chipset so you have to buy the same motherboard
Really the only way you can state the system is not by crap video
If you have a video card is done in the intercom you can just don't have to be crappy
Well, that is just what you can't buy by time
That's just the way it is
And I was looking for a laptop the one thing I really wanted was a good keyboard
It has proven number when you be tight-known you can feel
The upper left-pinning corner the whole thing goes much
Yeah, that's you know
Going with IBM
Expensive and is only at that time you couldn't really buy them through
You know discounters. So in fact when I was in Montana, I couldn't find a place to buy
I didn't want to buy a mill or unless I could actually test for a good board
So I actually went down to their business service center and said you guys got an R40 sit around
Yo, Joe can this guy play me your R40
And when I didn't play around y'all can't mess it with sitting guy
They were offered this guy and everyone said no, he said
And he said, but you know we do have this program
Friends and family of employees
Right, exactly
Yeah, actually I started up with Fujitsu
Actually, I got a reefer Fujitsu
It's fair. I mean it's a Windows 95 and engine machine
And it but it's been running for like 16 years now. I almost never shot it off
and you know
Lid broke literally has broken off of it
So I've just closed it and put it under under a monitor
But I plug it into it now, you know
And you know but it's
What I did was I kept plugging the guys you know at the place for a reefer
And the guy finally gave me his
Employee discount number to buy this
Refer because they went so quick
That if you didn't get on him right away and he knew that this was a good machine and I
Well, actually I was talking about something else
But he kind of struck up a friendship
But he finally gave me his
Employee discount number and I bought the
A reefer machine off there
Quick buy website and it's really I mean, you know if I could buy a machine
Comparable quality of
Contemporary
You know
State of the equipment. I mean just love it
But that kind of things got away. I mean, it's just you know
You just you can't even have access to the people in the tech support department that way anymore
You know this becomes so system wise you can't even
You can't even
Strike up a friendship like that anymore, you know
Even be a actual employee of that company
There's so many calls for that. Yeah, exactly
I am
George
It's just things that kind of mushroom data
Original way that this is to be working. Yeah, it really is to the point where I'm going to take a telescope
You best buy
Audio
Yeah, okay
It's zeros and zero the audio card I had
It actually had like a three-fold bias
It didn't even go to zero. It actually had a bias to three volts
The you know the power supply
Didn't have big enough to ask that probably why I died because the power supply wasn't well enough built
It completely overheated because it's working way too hard
And when it provided dirty power you can actually hear it when it was plugged in versus on that
And through the sound card
And this wall of sound card is crap too
What? You should be able to hear it
No, there should be any frequency once in a while
And it will come
And it's just thing after thing of just cheap crap
That normal person
Yeah, they're looking for price
Yeah, they would be like oh there's just some weird buzzing noise when you think twice about it
I just did
So you realize that it's just crap being hardware in different ways
You know, what I've been to the IBM was significantly higher than what I've worked
Pay for Dell or some else but they weren't
And the only compatibility problems I've had was the win mode of course
That drove me nuts
And I finally gave up on the Agera driver was so bad Ager eventually took it off their website
I mean it was it was really flaky
So I decided to try again here recently
The smart lane driver works really nice
And here was easy to do and works really nice
And the only other problem I had with it was when loading devian for some reason
The screen resolution wasn't everything
And I had to take around with the extra list
But other than that
It worked really good
And it's a good heavy-duty machine
It's a little too heavy on push-on to heavy
But it's I've been really pleased with the quality of it
And after test riding some of the other brands
And especially the keyboard phone
Yeah, some of us we've had an oval here
And that worked like it was actually a pretty decent machine
The price, all the keyboard and just look like a sturdy machine
And the joysticks are really nice
The joysticks, if you ever use the track point
A lot of people with a track point can take their index
And you know, put your thumb on
That's why it's there
So you can work the way around
So I never had a problem
You want to touch the power
I got rid of the touchpad really quick
Because your cuff moves across the touchpad and bingo and move
Forget it, went into the bios and disabled that way
Yeah
It doesn't have a trackfall on it too
No, it's not a trackfall, it's a joysticks
And the joysticks doesn't move the pointer by the amount you push it
It's actually a torque sensor
It's actually a torque sensor
And so it handles really good compared to some of the other brands
I could never ride ever since the first laptop I ever touched
I had handles that were pulled out
You like the touchpad?
I can't stand it
I know I can't stand touchpad either
Because I always end up randomly accidentally flipping out
Yeah, that's true
I'm not too bad about what I was just doing there
And as long as I can disabled
And have flicking
Also, because I'm having fingers
What if I had flicking it
The touchpad is you can go into your X or
They can adjust the pressure
The pressure sensitivity
And you can adjust the acceleration
For like flicking
You have to press it really hard
I really like it
The other thing is I don't want to wait
It's slapping my laptop
Oh, that's true, but really it's good
I mean, you need to shift with the buttons
It's not like you can just stand and push hard
Unless you've got that problem with the flicking case
Push hard and all of a sudden you sound like
It's not great
This thing is a real pain with the touchpad
I think it's because the processor is right in this area
It's so hot that
I think it's temperature sensitive to a degree
And I finally just got a separate Bluetooth mouse
Because I couldn't even get my hand up to the keyboard
Without jumping through a different window or something
It was absolutely insane
It helps a little bit to cool it
That's another thing too
Those touchpads
Those are another thing that they just can't push
Whichever one of the grand egg
There's probably a 15, 20 different touchpads
They control the one laptop
Sure
And you know which one you're going to get
You need to get the good one that works for a while
Or the cheap one
No, let's find out
That's one thing
I think this laptop is the only touchpad
I've ever not had a problem
Ever
I think they
Made it a little bit better quality
Because they were starting the gesturing
They really didn't...
This version doesn't have the full gesturing
Like the iPod, the iPod, the iPod
They can pinch
And you can pull apart
So like zoom in and see how
There's last thing the gesturing can do to save
Save time
But it does have two fingers for own
Pushes
It saves a lot of moving amounts
But you can't put them there
So how old is that?
This is from last Christmas
Because I wonder when their apples
Find they have a succumb to the market pressures too
What's the rationale between
The second phase iPod
The iPod is coming out
Basically looks like they've simply produced
A cheaper hardware version
The iPod version
Yeah
How do you know if that's going to happen?
Release the expensive one
When people stop buying that
Release the less expensive one
Yeah, well that's the point
There's succumb to the market pressures
There's succumb to the market pressures
When people stop buying that
They release their most bottled
That's great pillaging
Yeah
Is that a Chinese diver?
Open source conferencing
I didn't look at this
Yeah
But the name was Jim Jim
I don't know if that will work really well
You did
Yes
You need to create a new creative team
So tell your boss
Yeah, we're gonna use Jim Jim
Yeah, we're gonna use Jim Jim
Yeah, we're gonna use Jim Jim
Yeah, we're gonna use Jim Jim
What?
So I didn't go for any of the how-tos
But it looks like if you care to learn about
How you're software, version, server, what do you do?
Security-wise, that's a good idea
Yeah, that's
Definitely going on
What version of the software
And because they're just gonna look up
They're a little chart
They'll spit that out
Yeah, they're a little cheap
The poster is a little old
Yeah, it tells you
It tells you that your friend's
Is calling the kernel
Yeah, they should sell it
Yeah, they should sell it
They also list all the cracks
They wouldn't have far of a job
Just another table with that
And yeah
And it's pretty much just the four or four page
We'll give you the
Information levels
I think quite a far
What about the
Yeah, I don't
Get off
Get you a
Anywhere you use it
What's the difference in that in PSA UX?
Yeah, I don't know
I don't know, try
What can I do?
I think you can get the process like you
I don't say the oath
Good
Or each could be used
It could be used
Hmm
Nah, that's nothing you can't do with
A little bit of crack
Cut
Not there
Oh, it is there
And it
What is that?
That's too old
Yeah
By default on Linux Mint
Whenever you open a terminal
You get some kind of a saying
And some ask here
And it leads to moves here if they win
Dude, why did they come up with the moves?
Did anybody else see that?
There was a bug tracker
Or at least that
If you do
If you run an app
Get moved
It's supposed to be if you need to stray
But an app get moved
If you actually, if you run it right now
It's where an app get moved
It's nice to count
Like dance move?
No, just a demo
But somebody submitted a bug
Because it doesn't look like a cow
Yeah, it looks more like a bird
It doesn't really count
He's got a beak
Oh, cute
Let's see what else I can get here
There's the penguin
He won't try to lower it
And change the weight
Now, if
Okay
Some of these are less than
Well, there's some points
You could ask here
If you'd like to ask
If you ask for your stuff, it's just
Oh, yeah, there is some
Yeah
And...
A bunch of clothes
Is that like the Rhino's and the jungle
They'll put out the fires
I don't know
I don't know
Yeah, it's gonna be crazy
Yeah, it's gonna be crazy
Oh, yeah
Yeah, that Rhino
It's gonna be crazy
There we go
All right, so yeah, there's funny things
They're kind of interesting
What's with it?
Intertaining
Format gate for display
Yeah
Gate plus format
Oh, it's like a gate format
So, interesting
I might use it
So, anyways
It's another house
Who's there?
Why would you want to disable control
And it's not too kind to the Linux file system
That's the bad thing
Well, it is
Initiate the standard shutdown
Yeah, it's the generator
I think you can
I think that's become the general practice now
With the distributions
But, we're all Linux
It'll just call boot your machine
You know, boot your
Just straight boot
Just like reboot now
Instead of shutdown now
And that can be quite unkind to your file system
Mine calls up the
If you're in practice
You know, I'm probably testing that
Oh, yeah, if you're at the terminal, I'll mess you up
Just shut your head down
You may not even start shutdown
Some of them will just do reboot down now
It depends on the distribution problem
Reboot down now
Reboot
That's just, that's just, that's just, it's just, it's just a hard shutdown
Reboot down now
That doesn't save the file system
Reboot down now
Reboot down now
Reboot down now
You might have been read on the kitchen
Because it looks like it's in the
Etsy event gate control
If you change it as an
Exec shut now
Or now
No, because it's our old trade
Okay, and I'm gonna shut down.
Yeah, it must be known that it's catching it.
According to this, it should shut down.
No man on shut down.
R is restart now.
No, this is all for a normal shut down.
Yeah.
I don't know if the system didn't run off after it.
I don't know.
Wait, what are the other options here?
There's two man reboot and see what it says after us.
Are you done?
Cancel is running shut down.
So you can cancel as it's running the script.
That's right.
Shut down runs the script, the reboot doesn't run.
Sorry.
No problem.
No problem.
There you have to add a dash and add.
There's not full sync.
Oh, it will add a dash and add nothing.
Right.
This can come in a lot.
That's right.
It's unkind to your final system.
That's what I said.
That's what I said.
You might as well pull the plug if you're
going to do that.
Essentially a concussion for your computer.
It's essentially amnesia for your computer.
It's really what it is.
If anything happens to be dynamic at the moment,
it won't be a normal condition when you restart.
What's the recording for that?
Well, part of your file system is always
inactive memory in minutes.
Oh, and it has to run back.
Yeah, that's right.
It doesn't, depending on your settings here,
what is it?
It's the theory you write that sort of with the settings.
Because it stores all of the changes to your file system
or stored in memory until those changes are washed out
to the system.
And it doesn't do that automatically
when the question is changing to everything, whatever
you have it has been sent to.
I don't know what's going on, but that's general here.
Because that's a big power consumer for laptops.
So a lot of the laptop configurations
have the great backs turned the way down.
So that it's not an access to the disk all the time.
What thing about that too?
If you turn it off, go fly by accidently and start it.
But you can find out if you've got a data run
with this properly or if I've been in middle time.
Right.
It's more likely that even with the journal,
journaled file systems, they say that they're now 100%
and really close to what they're now 100%.
And when it shuts down, you could crop the data quickly.
I was curious that was when those multiple times.
Yeah.
What was that thing you used to have to add through?
There was some command you had to add to shut that.
Forget it.
It was summed up, flushing some cache memory from that.
And smart drive or something was called.
And you had in Windows smart drive,
you had to always make sure that it wrote to this
before it would shut down.
And this was the earlier versions of Windows.
I don't remember if it was that, that's the E5.
Yeah.
Yeah, what's similar to that is what Linux is doing.
It doesn't write everything in that.
Right.
Oh, that's a long list of them.
Do you remember it, Bernie?
Oh, yeah, I'm going to shut it off first.
That one's just any of them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, we're probably the same person, just air it out.
The session was still open for a little bit while you're pre-locking.
Now, don't go for it to re-name that for your start screen backup.
I almost did that.
Make sure you have a date.
