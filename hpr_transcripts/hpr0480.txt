Happy Halloween and welcome to Tit Radio Episode 12.
Let's meet our round table of geeks.
Clot 2.
Hello everyone.
Peter 64.
Yes I am.
Hazmat.
Adi Howdy.
G-Man.
Hello.
330.
Oh well.
And I'm Monster B.
And let's dive right into the feedback.
The first feedback I got was from Terry F.
I got a private message from him the other day I think.
I mean he mastered IRC.
It's just amazing what he can do now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But he sent me a message.
He created a new juiced penguin feed.
So if there's anybody that used to listen,
because I was having problems downloading the shows.
Because I guess like, you know, like G-Pider would try to pull down,
you know, like all their blog posts too.
Because I guess Randy had all the everything into one feed.
Oh yeah.
So Terry created a new feed and I'll go ahead and put that in the show notes.
And another one, an email I got was from Andy Owen.
He says he was catching up on some of the older podcast.
And he was walking home the other day, listening to Tit Radio.
And people were talking about Hannah Montana Lennox.
As soon as Peter started singing, his headphones started playing.
By the time he was done, the right ear of his headphone
completely stopped working.
And he says, I think it takes quite some talent to be able to sing so badly
that equipment is destroyed.
That he's put respect to Andy.
Where do you think of that, Peter?
The only thing I got to say to that Andy is,
ain't you got no gingerbread?
Ain't you got no candy?
Ain't you got no extra fed for me and little Andy?
That's all I've got once done by you.
Is that a real time?
Yeah, it is.
It's not like Parkinson's.
I mean, little Andy.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's a passby.
Andy, I can sing worse.
You might tell me I get a couple of bees, you see me?
Well, hopefully you broke the other side.
We did have some other feedback from Cafe Ninja.
He was listening to us and he said, just his sense worth.
If you're going to use green, it's a good idea to install the screen profile's package.
I don't know what that is, but it's probably worth looking up.
He said he likes to use his H space dash to then the host then screen space dash R.
Which is actually quite good because I was just hating into my machine
then running screen in there, but this way it's just automatic.
You just run that in the terminal and straight away you're in your screen session.
Oh, of course.
Yeah.
I want to say that that is something else that some about has better session connected
and drop updating since the local TTY isn't being opened.
And something to that effect.
So yeah, anyway, that's a good one to know.
Thanks, Cafe Ninja.
Anybody else getting a feedback?
Nope.
I did get another one, but I'm not going to read it.
I'm going to do some research on it.
Somebody with a name, Nikki, with a K.
And they made a comment about my hair.
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Don't they like mullets?
Well, I don't have a mullet.
But I'm going to have to find out if this is real email or not.
Or if somebody's just goofing around.
But they do like my hair.
They see me at it.
Oh, hi, Lennox.
Yeah, it's kind of weird.
All right.
Anyways, you can send us feedback at titredio.info.
And you can also post on hackerpublicradio.org.
And also, we have a thread going over it.
Ben rev forums and Lennox cranks forums.
I didn't know we were in the Ben rev forums.
Yeah, there's a, I guess, I think it's him.
He, somebody posts every show over there.
Oh, that's the spider, the little crawler thing.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But you can definitely leave comments over there.
Oh, cool.
Okay.
And also on the Lennox cranks forum.
And I'll put the links in the show notes.
All right, Claud, do you want to start off with the first topic?
Yeah.
Have you guys heard about, I mean, you probably have,
but have you heard about tiny core linux?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Never tried it.
Okay, what do you, what do you believe it is?
I want to see if I'm the only one who had a misperception of it.
I thought it was just like a tiny little Lennox distro.
That was about 10 megabytes.
Okay, yeah, actually, that's more than I really understood it.
To be, I thought it was like literally just almost like a really basic kernel image.
Well, I guess I kind of thought it was a distro.
But what it is, as it turns out, is it is.
It's small.
It's 10 megabytes, little distro.
You boot up.
It boots in literally like five seconds or something.
I mean, it's super fast.
And then it actually gives you a desktop, a GUI desktop.
And from this desktop, you can start building up your own little,
almost a Linux from scratch distribution.
I mean, except that it's not Linux from scratch, obviously.
It's a tiny core.
But I mean, what you do is you can copy, you know, their little boot folder over to your,
either your USB drive or your hard drive wherever you're installing it.
I installed it on my triple EPC just for kicks.
I wanted the cards in there.
And then you set up grubs.
And they have this little repository that they maintain,
filled with what are called tiny core extensions, TCEs.
Or actually, I think, now it's TCEs, but I was using an older version of tiny core.
And these are little packages, a little bit like the Slack modules,
if you've ever looked into running Slacks, how they have their little modules
that you can install for extra applications.
They're a little bit like that.
They're basically self-contained, tar.gz,
little, I guess, self-contained binaries of the applications that you might want to run on your computer.
And those go into one directory.
And your little core Linux distribution is in another directory.
And then you can redirect it.
You can say, okay, I want the core of the OS to be on this partition,
and then my home to be over here, so you can have a persistent home,
or you can have your extension directory somewhere else,
so that it can be, you know, when you install applications,
after you reboot, you don't lose all those applications.
And there are all kinds of little extensions.
They have the Atharose drivers for the Wi-Fi stuff.
They've got the, I mean, they've just got everything, you know, GCC.
Well, I don't know if they have GCC,
but they've got a lot of new utilities and stuff like that.
So basically, TinyCore is a busy box installed, I guess,
with a GUI desktop.
You can install like FluxBox extension,
so you can boot into FluxBox,
or what they call hacked box,
which is like FluxBox with some open box extras included into it somehow.
That's what I'm running right now.
And just all kinds of cool things.
And writing your own extensions is even that hard, actually.
It's a little bit like a Slack build in that you just basically,
you compile the application that you want,
but you compile it into a separate, you know,
a different destination directory.
It's a destination, DUR equals whatever.
Now, then you move the documentation over and stuff like that,
and then you just tar it and zip it up,
and call it dot TCZ,
and drop it into your little extension directory,
and next time you boot up TinyCore,
you now have that application installed in your path,
and you just type it in and start running it.
So, a lot of cool little applications in their repo right now,
and a really, really fast boot time,
and everything just works really, really fast,
as you can imagine, because the thing is tiny.
And at least on the triple EPC,
it's unbelievable how it just out of the box,
and everything just kind of like,
I mean, not everything just worked,
but it was really easy getting everything installed,
so that it worked really promptly,
including the resolution of the screen and everything.
It was really easy to adjust and stuff like that.
It's really, really cool.
Lots of fun to play around with.
And a 10 megabyte download,
I mean, that's almost can't help but play around with it.
I mean, it's like 10 megabytes.
I've downloaded podcasts that are like five times that size,
and just download it, try it out, it's really fun.
So, what do you think of the Window Manager?
I like it a lot.
Like I said, oh, you mean the default one?
Yeah, I think it's called the Fast Light Window Manager, FL.
The Fast Light Toolkit is what it's using,
and it does its job.
It's got a nice little pretty dock down at the bottom.
I don't care much for that much.
I switched over to hacked box almost immediately,
but nothing's wrong with it.
I mean, it's definitely functional and everything.
It didn't do anything for me,
so I just switched over to hacked box.
Okay, that's a new one, Ami.
What did you say it was hacked box?
Yeah, it's basically flux box with some,
I think basically with open box pieces hacked into it somehow.
I don't know enough about open box still to be able to tell you,
you know, what exactly the difference is.
I haven't gotten around to configuring flux box enough
to really notice that anything's noticefully different
than my other flux box installs,
so not really sure.
Mainly right now, I've just been playing around with writing some of the extensions
for some of the packages that they don't have,
notably EMAX and IRS as I.
They don't have extensions for either of those two,
so I'm trying to hack an install script for that,
and just trying to configure my environment.
I mean, this is what's so cool, you know,
because I was looking at all these little,
I was looking at flip-tas,
you remember that one, right, Monster Reef?
Oh, yeah.
That was a cool one,
but I was thinking I couldn't solve that,
but you know, everything I was looking at
had just like one or two little applications
that I didn't want or just had the wrong set of applications,
you know, like Woolfix I was really enjoying,
but it had all these GNOME apps that I've just not used to.
I'm like, what I really want is either,
you know, just like the things I'm used to
and either KDE but without KDE or the stuff
that I'm used to and enlightenment or, you know,
just whatever,
so it's really a cool way to just build up your own,
quickly build up your own little custom distro.
I mean, it's not really that hard,
it's just plugging in basically modules
that other people have written.
I mean, it's a lot like,
it sells a lot like slacks in that sense,
except I perceived that it's a lot easier,
for me it was a lot easier to customize
because it's just so bare bones from the very beginning,
you know, I mean, even slacks has KDE 3,
you know, I mean, if you don't want that,
then you have to spend all this time
pulling out KDE 3 and trying to make that persistent
and then putting in the module of the thing that you actually want
with TinyCore,
the only the base install is persistent,
and you can just do whatever you want to
in your little extension directory and your home directory,
so it's really, really nice.
So the one weirdness of it is that it doesn't have
that traditional kind of user and super user feel to it
because, you know, I don't know if this is a function of busybox
or just being a persistent like live OS,
but you don't really go in and add user blah, blah, blah,
you know, you're just kind of like this user
and all you have to do to type in, you know,
to get root access as you say pseudo, you know, whatever.
And there's no, there's not really a password,
so I'm working on trying to figure out
what's up with all that stuff
and having to read up on whether that's
because of the live OS or because it's busybox.
So, but aside from that, it's really fun to play around with.
I highly recommend you look at it.
Like I say, it's 10 megabytes.
I mean, you can't, it's almost like ridiculous not to look at it.
It's just really neat.
Right, you can't go wrong with 10 megabytes.
Yeah, I mean, it took me no time.
I mean, literally I had it on my hard drive, you know,
the time less than it takes me to download most of the podcasts that I listen to.
You know what I mean?
It's just such a quick download.
Sparing it to a CD or whatever,
boot into it and just go for it.
It's really neat.
You can build it onto a USB drive,
you can build it onto your hard drive,
you can build it onto a tiny little
partition of your hard drive, whatever you want.
And it's really, really flexible.
You can put the core OS like on your hard drive
but then have your home partition on a USB drive, you know,
or you could have the core OS on a USB drive and your home on your hard drive,
or your end-your-extensions on something else.
You know, it's just, it's really, really flexible.
You just pass certain options in the, in the grub,
in the kernel line, defining where,
where the local extension directory is,
and where the, and where your home directory is,
and it will bind it to whatever you tell it to bind it to.
Super easy.
I mean, literally, it just took me no time to get this thing up and running,
coming from not knowing even really,
not really understanding what it was.
I thought it was something for, for distribution people,
you know, to take, to take this tiny core,
make this kernel or something,
and then do whatever people do with kernels.
And I didn't understand that it was kind of a,
really kind of easy sort of simple,
build up your own environment kind of thing.
So it's really, really cool.
And they just, I think they just tonight released 2.5,
released candidate 2 or 3 or something.
I'm actually over-inspired.
See channel right now talking to them about packaging,
so they seem to be a pretty active,
little community and stuff.
That's fair enough.
And their website's really good.
Yeah, their website's really good.
It's got lots of tutorials on it and stuff,
so, and their Wiki is good.
Have neat projects.
Anybody got any questions for Clot 2?
No, it looks cool.
I know I saw this all the time,
but it's just another,
another example of how you can never ever get bored with this.
Yeah.
There's always something to play around with.
Yep.
You know?
Not the chances are that you'd ever run something like,
oh, for me, in particular, it wouldn't run it.
But I certainly get on there and have a play with it for a while.
But that's something, Clot 2,
you can back on the USB,
keep in the car when you go to a friend's house, fix their computer.
You've got it handy, huh?
Yeah, and that way you can only bring along what you know
that you need and are familiar with and stuff like that.
Yeah, yeah, good stuff.
Yeah, it's really, really cool.
So, speaking of good stuff,
how much candy did you get tonight?
You went and trick a treating, right?
Of course.
I went as a human being.
So, you changed.
You put on your mask.
Yeah.
You didn't actually let your hair get back to natural color for one night.
Well, I dyed it to, like, a brown, you know, for fun.
People need to go out.
Really good stuff.
And speaking of costumes,
what are you wearing, Peter?
Between that and seven parties.
I've just got the napkins taught around more waste.
That's it.
I think what they'd be.
Did anyone have a Windows 7 party?
Did anyone know, though?
Yeah, I mean, I wonder if they were really,
really, these parties.
I mean, that just seems a little bit odd to me.
I think that's it.
Well, there were enough of them bake out.
They actually turned a guy down.
He applied to get the whole kit and everything
and they turned him down.
I believe when I see it,
I think it's all media.
Fake stories being leaked into the media
by Microsoft Marketing Machine.
So, you know,
fake stories being leaked into the media
by Microsoft Marketing Machine.
Well, it just seems so obvious
that if you did run Windows,
it's just the two-way
getting a bloody disc, isn't it?
Yeah, really.
You'd be stupid if you didn't.
Apply for one.
They're dumb enough to give them away.
I still wouldn't use it.
I still wouldn't.
Yeah, I know, but I mean,
plenty of people obviously do.
Yeah, they had to get them on and fill out a form, I think.
There was much to it, but anyway.
I'm sure we'll hear more about
the Great Windows 7.
Totally off to a good start.
I'm kind of like the tilt guys.
I didn't really...
I mean, I heard a lot about it
sort of before it happened,
but I really haven't gotten the...
I haven't seen the, like,
Windows 7, a mind-blowing success,
kind of story that I really had expected to see.
But maybe those are still, you know,
yet to come, I don't know.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Look, we're lost here.
It's dark.
Dark is night, right in the middle of the afternoon.
And we've lost the path in that tree.
Easy, Clayton.
Keep your head, man.
I'm getting out of here.
I'm not going to stay here and be murdered.
Clayton!
Stay with us.
No, no.
I'm going to find a path and get out of here.
Clayton, stay here.
We'll find a way back.
I don't want to stay here and die.
I want to get away from this fight.
Stop being a fool!
Freeze!
There's...
Anyone heard?
I think we talked a little bit about this studio
on Crankstown Week.
When you had to have an invite?
Yeah, I think we did.
Yeah, I think that's how I heard about it.
Yeah, well, okay.
So, as we know, like,
one of the biggest benefits of limits is that
you can modify practically anything to see your needs.
In fact, that's almost one of the...
Well, that is...
To me, that's the main foundation
that limits is based on why I use it.
In this studio, sort of,
expands on this and just makes it for anyone,
you know, anyone,
it's easy for them to do it.
And they provide all the online tools
that allow you to...
just to build your own customized limits distribution.
What I did, I jumped on there,
and I just wanted to have a play with you.
So, I thought what I was going to do was build
distribution that had myth already installed,
so I could just take it,
pop it in any machine,
and turn it into a myth-front-end.
And I was just so impressed
at how easy all that was.
But, virtually,
well, once were you've used it too,
like, when you go to the front screen,
and practically just ask your questions,
doesn't it?
Like, you choose a template,
whether you want just,
what they call it,
a J-E-O-S,
just enough OS,
which has no window manager
or anything like that,
or just get you booted to the command line.
You can set up a server,
text-based server addition,
a minimal X,
which is the one I used,
which uses ice-win,
or you can do a GNAME,
or K-2-4, or three desktop.
So, by just entering one of those questions,
that'll get you started,
then the challenge is,
I suppose, then a package is the absolute bare minimum packages
that you need to get that system up and running.
And from then on,
you start to customize it
to do exactly what you want it to do.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Make sure that,
if you select that you want on live CD,
they take care of all the packages
that you would need to do the install.
Yeah.
Now, you mentioned the other day
that to do this sort of stuff
has been around for a long time.
But really, you could do this
with any distribution practically.
The thing with this
has just made it so easy, didn't it?
Yeah.
You can do kickstart files
and Red Hat and Fedora,
but, you know, those are just text files.
And if you get something wrong,
you're going to have to go fix it again.
And this makes it super simple to do.
Yeah.
And that was the other beautiful thing about this,
is once you've gone to design your customized distribution,
you can then go and test drive it
before you even download it.
So what you can do after you go through,
the other thing I did like about this is
you could add external repos.
So that way,
because I want to miss,
which is some part of the actual open source repos,
I think would go on to say,
I want to put it to Pacman repos,
which has a lot of the employer
and all the codecs and stuff like that,
as part of it.
Then I just said,
I want to install,
have miss TV installed when this thing is built.
So it went and pulled out,
miss packages off the Pacman repo,
put it in my ISO,
and then I was able to go and test.
Well, you build it,
and it's built,
I take it online,
and then you get to run it in a virtual machine.
And then if you're happy with the way it is,
then you just go and tell it that you want to
build this as a
bootable live CD
that is capable of an installation,
is what I did.
Wow.
Yeah, it really is,
I know as much as people don't like,
I suppose it's novel they don't like,
and opens this to a degrees
a little bit different, I suppose.
But yeah, it really is a brilliant thing
just to go in and have a play with.
Yeah, really,
you can't get wrong.
Even if you didn't know what you were doing,
you'd have to be pretty bad to build something
and it didn't work.
In fact, I don't think you could.
So the base install is sort of that just enough
to ask where it,
I mean, there's no way you're going to build something
with like Myth TV,
but you forgot to install,
you know, like,
I don't know,
X, you know,
something like that, right?
I mean, it wouldn't let you do something like that.
Yeah, that's right.
It would be no different
than if you were running Zeus
and you wanted to install Myth TV
on that,
and you were running all that,
the Zypro or did it through Yast.
As soon as you told it,
you want to install the Myth TV Package.
It goes through and does all the dependencies for you.
So you couldn't get that wrong.
There's only things like that for other repos.
Pardon?
And you can even pull stuff from other repos.
Well, yeah,
and you can pass tours.
Yeah, you can go through,
and I'd take it any disc,
any repository that opens Zeus users.
Yeah.
Like I said,
all the Pakman ones for there,
you could have included all the Nvidia Addy drivers
if you wanted to,
because you could include them
when you added repos.
I mean,
the sky's the limit when it comes to that.
Whatever you can do with Zeus,
you could just do with Zeus Studio.
The only problem I ran into was,
when I recently set up my distribution,
I wanted auto login,
because I was building this
is a media distribution.
You know, like I said,
to turn any computer into a media front end,
I also included XBMC in it.
I'll get into that a bit later.
But I set up for an auto login.
So when I logged in,
for some reason,
in the VM,
I couldn't use my keyboard.
My mouse was working fine.
I had to,
and then I logged out,
and I came to the,
it's the GDM log on screen,
it's a little KDM,
whatever it uses.
And my keyboard worked.
Then I logged back in,
and sure enough,
my keyboard was working in it.
And I actually,
I mentioned that,
because I was talking to him,
and I see what I was doing all this.
And anyway, I thought,
this could be a problem with that VM,
whatever it uses for the
virtual machine that you tested in.
When I actually built it,
and tried it on a machine,
long behold,
exactly the same thing.
When it booted into my
customized learning distribution,
I had no keyboard.
I had to get out.
Logged back in,
and it worked.
Anyway, Jay Lindsay found
out that that is a problem
at the moment.
If you use auto log in,
it's actually skipping a couple of steps
that it should be.
That's obviously something
that I'll rectify pretty soon.
I'd imagine.
Because no one uses
auto log in on Linux Peter,
except you.
I'm probably the only one
ever found that bug.
I mean,
oh, people,
do that feature?
Yeah.
But if you can appreciate,
if you want to build a multi-medium
distribution,
that's what you want to do.
It's for the booting.
And it was great.
I could stick it in any
laptop, any computer,
and it just start
myth TV,
and it just used that
UNP or whatever it might
have used,
and logged on to my
back end,
and there you had it.
Now, like I said,
I did install XBMC as well.
However, XBMC needs hardware acceleration
to actually run.
So that was a bit of a fail.
I'd have to, you know,
but if I did this again,
I'd just include the drivers,
the Nvidia,
and drivers on the thing
or at least include the repays,
anyway.
Oh, God.
Now we use inputit.
We're better off
by staying together.
I don't know,
whether we are or not.
Listen!
It's great.
Sounds like he's crangling.
Come on!
Oh, he couldn't have gotten far.
Well, I don't think he had
ice cream.
I'd take it easy now.
Be careful.
Oh, there he is.
Yes.
Stitched out on the ground.
But I actually tried it too.
I made a,
just like a minimal,
you know, install with fluxbox,
and all the KDE4 games,
and the ISO was only
250 megabytes.
You know, the download size?
That's cool.
I think that's kind of a good way
for distributions to minimize,
like a lot of a bandwidth usage,
you think, you know,
let people just decide what they want
on their, on their download.
But also what you can do with this too.
You can upload RPM.
So if you create like a custom kernel,
or maybe I could custom RPM package,
you can upload that.
You can change everything about it,
like the logo, the boot end screen,
the wallpaper.
Wow.
So you can make it look like your distro.
Crazy.
That's really cool.
I didn't get into all the scripts.
Maybe, I don't know, Jalen,
could you explain those scripts,
what you can do with them?
Well, they have an overlay section,
where you can upload individual files
that you want on the image,
which means that you could put
your existing configuration files in there.
And when you boot up the first time,
they're already there.
And there's a script section
where you can tell it,
you want the script to run
at the end of the build,
or when it boots.
And, you know,
pretty much anything that you could
put in a shell script,
you could do it in this.
Like, you could add users,
copy files around,
echo things into configuration files.
Yeah, it's, I mean,
it's really great technology.
I mean, I like to see,
you know, other distros doing this.
It would seem,
and I don't know anything about it,
but it would seem like,
people building distributions
are probably using a set of shell scripts
to kind of throw all their stuff together.
I mean, I'm sure they're not doing it all by hand.
And probably what Zeus did
was take those scripts
that they're using to build their distro,
and just kind of like,
we can get into a web interface.
And so you're just answering questions,
and then it's kind of like,
running everything that they do anyway.
So you'd think that other distributions
would have that same kind of workflow
that they could in theory
link into a web interface.
It'd be pretty cool.
You couldn't go wrong with this.
That's the thing.
Even if you'd never done anything like this
before which I hadn't,
just automated everything for you.
And I even went after I made my life CD,
I made it so it could be installed
and not installed on a computer too,
because it just had everything I really needed
for that particular computer, really.
The only thing I didn't check,
which I meant to,
was after I built my like Zeus,
you know, customized distribution,
I didn't check how fast it actually booted
compared to actual something,
which would have really interested me
to see how light it was.
There's no way it could be arched.
I want to be bloody good too, I tell ya.
No, I mean,
and when I say how fast I case,
it might take 20 seconds.
I don't think any modern distribution
boots that slave does it.
They're all bloody quick these days
on the machines we run.
Anyway, look,
do yourself a favor,
and you can go and have a play with it.
You do have to sign up for the invitation,
but now it's almost instantaneous.
As soon as you sign up for it,
then you'll get something in your mailbox,
some activation card,
and you just go there,
and on the way you go.
Yep, it's worth a look at.
You can plus that you can make 32-bit,
64-bit,
and then you even have a server addition,
and you can even pick not only OpenSusa,
but Sled,
10-11,
and I'll put the link in the show notes.
Anything else in this one?
No, for me.
Well, let's move on to Asmeth.
Oh, howdy, howdy.
This week got to spend most of it
trying to get a Mythbox back up,
but this was a week
that Carmen Koala come out,
and they were born too,
and I did take enough time out
of working on my junk file Mythbox
to sample some of the new Ubuntu distro.
There's not a whole lot to say about it
other than it works.
Did some installs that I don't normally do.
I did just an online distro upgrade
with my MesoNetbook,
and the whole thing worked
when it got through,
which surprised me I was figuring,
well, I'll probably end up having to download the ISO
and rebuild this thing
when I get through,
but the distro upgrade worked.
It did download a whole bunch of crap though,
but that's just what it takes to upgrade
from an earlier version.
And I also got
Ubuntu 9.10,
and like I said,
it just plain work.
No flies it.
Anyplace.
There are nothing broke anywhere.
And this is pretty wide range computers
that I've put it on too.
Most of my antiques.
And that's about all I can say for it.
You know, when you don't have problems with it,
you kind of run out of conversation fast.
Even put it on your server?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what's running on the server.
Rather than the server addition this time,
I put Ubuntu.
Well, the server's going to go on the shop
and I want to, you know,
use it as a music
and an augcast player too out there.
I haven't heard much about it,
but I haven't listened to that many podcasts this week
about the release.
I don't think I think it's about it,
but I know a lot of people who were running, you know,
it...
Well, I think just about everybody's been running,
you know, the RC,
or the BADES,
or the ELFIS,
and, you know,
and all the way through the development on this thing,
while people kept saying,
yeah, it just works.
We're not having problems.
That's really cool.
I remember, you know,
not two or three releases ago.
I remember one that, you know, broke X for a while,
or something,
and...
Oh, hardy, hardy was bad.
Everybody but me had problems with it,
and I was running the ELFIS,
and I just kept upgrading it
until I had the full release,
and I never had any problems.
But everybody else I hear,
well, it was all hardware-related issues.
I just happened to have the right combination of...
Yeah.
...hardware for hardy.
Yeah, it's really good to hear about a solid, solid release.
Is this an LTS one or no?
No.
The next one is LTS.
Is it the next one next spring?
Yeah.
All right.
Anything else?
Nothing else for me.
All right.
Next up, G-Man.
All right.
We're playing with this thing called
Forronics Test Suite,
and it is just all kinds of cool.
So, basically, they built this thing with PHP 5.
It's primarily G-Man line,
but you can get the PHP GTK stuff
and the graphical interface will let you do the same thing.
But pretty much, you run it,
and you do list tests,
or list suites,
and it will tell you
the possible tests that you can install.
And this thing tests various aspects of the system,
and it will later save the results or print them out to you.
But the suites,
there's specific ones for BSD,
and such as that,
but you can test, like,
ray tracing, 3D rendering,
feel right to the file system on the RAM,
and do all these speed tests,
and they have this cool thing called
Forronics Global,
where people can upload the results of these benchmarks,
and the software itself will do a,
it will read the hardware
and see what kind of motherboard and processor,
and hard drive and everything like that.
It'll tell what kind of X version you have,
and it uploads all this to the server
for everybody to compare their results.
It was pretty cool stuff.
So, it's just to the gray like that.
Was it 3D marks that they used to do in Windows?
That sort of stuff?
Yeah, exactly.
It's going to stress test the video card,
and pretty much every piece of the system,
they can test with this thing.
Yeah, that is cool.
I've often asked,
there's some benchmarking tool for Linux,
and I'm getting a bit sick of JLX keys.
But...
Diligence codems ask IRC
if it's the same thing as hard info.
I don't know what hard info is.
I don't know what he's talking about either.
Yeah, when you list the available tests,
it'll tell you whether the test is actually 3,
or if there's a retail component involved,
like Doom 3,
you're obviously going to need some kind of retail thing.
Yeah, I'm looking at the screenshots,
and it looks like it,
it outputs it to an HTML file,
or is that HTML?
I was just wondering if you can use it for your own website,
like if you're going to do some tests
and like different motherboard,
could you actually use all this for your website,
or do they have like a disclaimer?
Yeah, I mean,
I'll think there's going to be a problem with that.
The global thing is just so they can have it all in one spot,
so everybody can compare.
I'm not sure about the anonymous thing.
It asks you,
on the first run,
it asks you if you want to submit anonymous statistics.
I'm not sure what extent they go to.
When you look on for Linux Global,
there's a bunch of entries marked anonymous,
but I don't sure if that's the same thing.
Let's say it's already in the community repository on that.
It's been ran for a wall in, hasn't it?
Yeah, I think you probably want to go ahead
and get the most up-to-date one you can get.
The development one.
Because it's available in like Fedora,
you can get version 18 something.
But you start to run into the problems of links being dead
in their scripts.
And some of them will start to fail.
But if you get the newest one now,
those will be up-to-date with the links.
Because it's essentially a bunch of shell scripts.
It downloads all this to your home directory
and runs the scripts that way.
Pretty easy to install.
Oh yeah, very.
If it's not, you can get it in most repos now,
but you can grab the development version.
It's just an install script.
Like you can run it directly from the tarball if you want it.
I'm going to wipe till 330.
Mike's a package for me to install.
It's right, man. Did you hear that?
I'm not making any packages for you.
You're still welcome.
I make you a package.
It'll be ticking, sir.
So what kind of package do 330 make?
It was a present.
I wrapped it.
I put a bow on it.
It was pretty.
I forgot you guys mentioned it,
but I already forgot what he made.
No comment.
Oh, I said enough yesterday.
Okay.
Yeah.
I felt bad.
I felt bad.
Completely.
It, my neck,
until the blood was flowing freely,
and then she,
a leadership,
sucked at it,
and swallowed it.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
My daughter speaks truth, sir.
She has never lied in all these years.
So what's your story 330?
How to make our PM packages?
Well, actually,
I have a dilemma here.
Do we want to hear about how
Adobe is pushing for flat and PDF
in our new open government?
Or do we want to hear more about
the laptops that they're giving
to Australian kids that are spying on them?
Talk about the Australian thing, 330.
If anything, I saw there was,
it was a while back.
They were talking about this back in March,
but I haven't heard anything about it,
but I may not have a kid in college,
or you know, and I would say,
no, talk about that.
That's interesting what they're going to do
with that monitoring software and stuff on it.
All right.
We have one vote for Australian story.
I really don't care about Australian stories.
They have no application to my life,
so go with the other one.
All right.
All right.
We're at one and one.
I just want you to speak up so I can hear you.
I'm sorry.
We're at one and one.
Tom, what's sound bright and draw-wise?
I'm going to say the laptop story
because Peter's bigger than Clot 2.
Well, one's the second story.
I must admit I didn't hear the second story.
I forget.
I don't know.
Talk about them, bud.
Let's talk about them.
Talk about them.
Yeah, do something about them.
Well, I didn't want to joke it
and have a whole bunch of stories.
That's true.
No, go for Australia.
I'm all about that.
Okay.
And Australia, they're giving these,
there's the loan.
It'd be great if I could talk now.
The Lenovo ID had S10E.
It's a netbook that they're shipping
with Windows 7 on it.
And what they've done is they're specifically
made by Lenovo for school kids and their teachers
because in Australia they gave the teachers
and the kids the same laptop.
But they've put in innovative technologies, quote unquote,
that they have advanced network security
and remote manageability tools,
which means that they can watch,
they can look at the content that you're serving on the internet
and they can disable it remotely at any time.
And they also put RFID tagging in it,
which means that if the laptop was lost or stolen
or otherwise destroyed,
they would still be able to find it
because RFID chips are pretty resilient to,
I think, everything but a microwave.
Even if you took it and pitched it in the river,
they could still find it.
Hey, just run it to the microwave first.
Yeah, but then you're destroying school property,
which could be an issue.
But one of the things that I'm seeing is, you know,
RFID isn't that hard to track.
I mean, it's kind of what it's made for.
So, you know, we can go into, you know,
paranoid parent mode here and go,
well, what about the pedophile
that gets himself an RFID reader
and starts tracking kids around
or the simple fact that you don't need to spy
on your damn kids all the time.
Hey, that's a parent's job.
Yeah, I still reckon that parents
are going to type responsibility
for what their kids are doing.
And that's nice, not just what they're doing
on their bloody computer, either.
I'm all school when it comes to that,
so the stuff on the front.
Yeah, and just take your kid down
to the dinner table and ask him what they did.
I mean, you put a student in front of a kid
and they'll start telling you the truth.
It's crazy.
Yeah, just being involved.
Getting involved in what they're doing.
I don't think so, but I'll soon have
a blog post up on something kind of techy,
teaching kids how to get around this
by using Linux off of a thumb drive.
I'd have to look at the hardware specs
more because I think they all have
Broadcom wireless chips in them.
Well, my name is supported, aren't I?
These days?
Yeah, I have to make sure that that one is
or go them all how to go immediately
and install the driver.
Yeah, I think just, you know,
booting just about any live distro
with a persistent directory in it
and they'll be good, you know,
your public.
Yeah, there's a way around the Broadcom, too.
Yeah, as long as you're going to run a live distro
off a USB, we'll use another USB port.
Plug another...
Plug a different Wi-Fi card in.
Plug a different Wi-Fi card in.
One that you know will work.
I'm sure on top of giving these kids these laptops,
they've got to be giving them thumb drives
and all that crap.
Yeah, they probably...
I mean, what kid doesn't have a thumb drive at this point?
So, they've already got everything at their disposal.
They just need to put all the things in the right order.
Stay in the...
The other story is more US-centric.
So, Claw2 can, you know, feel relevant.
But, um, the Obama administration
has made transparent and public access
to government information priority bullshit.
But, uh, Adobe is trying to weasel its way in.
Uh, they have a...
The Adobe opens up website,
which is Adobe.com slash opengov,
where they're trying to convince people that flash and PDF
need to be a part of this open and transparent government thing.
The only problem is the entire website's in flash.
No, everything.
You can't select text.
You can't search it.
You can't run scripts against it.
You can't copy it.
You can't do anything.
Hold on, I want to try to get to that side.
I just want to see it not work.
What is it?
Adobe.com slash opengov.
Opengov.
It's done.
It's done.
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
So, you know, in their...
They're open and transparent and, you know,
you know, lovey-dovey.
You know, let's be happy and nice and play with everyone.
If you're blind, you're screwed.
Yeah.
You know, if you don't run flash or any of this stuff
because of, you know, free software ideals, you're screwed.
I mean, I don't mind PDF except for the fact that it's not a very good
format for being transparent.
I mean, you know, it's kind of a pain in the rear to
get PDFs to behave in screen readers and the such.
You know, just good old fashioned text documents
would probably be a better solution.
But I think this kind of shows the,
the uselessness of the word open at this point.
Yeah, well, that is funny.
Yeah, that site is useless.
It's like a grayish thing.
And actually, if I try to go to, like,
open those flash index about HTML,
it just threatens to crash conquerer entirely.
So, yeah, wow, funny.
Yeah, I mean, you can't increase the text size.
You can't decrease it.
You can't change the font.
You can't do anything to it.
I think it's a brilliant point, though.
We should tell, I'm going to tell all my blind friends to go to that site.
I'm going to, and I'm going to do it sarcastically.
And I'm going to be like,
that's a really great initiative.
It's great.
Adobe is really opening up.
Just go to Adobe.com slash opengov.
And then when they start to lose their mind,
they have them write a letter to both the president and to Adobe.
Yeah, maybe help them edit it.
You know, remove all the swear words and the...
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, that's pretty funny.
I'm actually really curious now as to what their site could possibly say,
but I guess I'll never know,
because I'm not going to really bother,
and I'm not curious enough to install Flash.
Well, in the story, there's a little bit of some of it,
but no one was really interested in talking about what the site actually said,
because of the obvious and unmistakable irony that was it being completely in Flash.
And there's a group of web developers and designers called Sunlight Labs,
which is a...
It's like an EFF of web coders that kind of ripped this thing apart
in a absolutely hilarious and psychotic way.
What's the name of the group again?
Sunlight Labs.
Sunlight Labs.com.
Okay.
All right, some good finds, 330.
You guys ready for the commands of the week?
Yep.
All right, glad to.
Oh, I'm first, okay.
Well, this is pretty easy,
and hopefully not everyone knows it yet.
It's just something I've been noticing a lot lately
because I've been playing around, like I said, those Slack build scripts
and the little tiny core Linux scripts.
It's a...
Everyone knows the make-der command, right?
Mkdir, of course, to make a new directory.
But did you know that you could do a make-der dash p as an parent?
And then you can say, okay, so I want to make...
I want to make, you know, like a podcast directory,
and in podcasts, I want there to be a Linux cranks directory,
and then in Linux cranks, I also want there to be a TIT radio directory.
So what you can do is say make-der dash p dot slash podcast slash Linux cranks slash TIT radio.
And it will make each...
You know, it will make all those directories,
even though so far there's not a podcast,
there's not yet a Linux cranks that will make those two,
and it will make that TIT radio directory.
So you've got instead of saying make-der podcasts,
and then seeding into podcasts,
and make-der Linux cranks,
and then seeding into Linux cranks,
and make-der TIT radio.
So make-der dash p will make the directory that you want to make
plus all the directories that need to be made
in order to lead up to it, if that makes sense.
Guys, that gave me a headache.
Can you put that in the IRC where I can see it?
Yeah, I probably just didn't do a very good explanation.
So...
No, it was a good explanation.
It was just what you put a switch and then some flashes after it.
We all kind of blazed over.
Sorry.
Just so people know, with the command of the week,
if you get out of the Linux cranks forum,
all the commands with either a bit of the main page
or just a national nation of what's happening with them,
you'll find them over there.
One of the threads, what did we call it?
I think it was just called CARE,
or for me that I like, or something?
Yeah.
So for people who sort of miss it,
but would like to know, go over there and have a look.
Yeah, there'd be a link to that in the show notes too.
And thank you, Quattu.
I can see what you're talking about now,
but that will make all the whole directory chain.
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty cool.
Yes, that is cool.
Yeah.
It saves me a lot of time.
I used to make the directory, and then I'd change directory.
Make the next one.
Yeah.
This is the way to do it.
Very nice.
What do you got for us, Peter?
Unfortunately, if you don't run CARE or Conqueror
to be more specific, you won't get much out of this one.
But I know a lot of people who do run Conqueror
just either click on the icon or type Conqueror
in the terminal or whatever.
But that typically just opens it up, I think, in the webpage view.
I'm not quite sure, because it's been long time since I've started that way.
But if you start it with KFM client,
then space open, say, profile,
and profiles with the capital P, that's all one word, profile,
then you can either open it up straight in its file management view
or the web browsing view, or if you go to the trouble
to set up your own profiles and name them,
for instance, I just have one that I've called Peter,
which opens up in the file manager view,
but with split windows in the two directories
that I want to move files, typically the most,
which is from my missbox to any of my other computers.
So that's very easy to do.
Once you get to go into Conqueror,
set up, you get it set up the way you want,
then you just go up to the settings, I think it is,
and say, save profile, call it whatever you want,
then simply when you get to start it,
instead of opening Conqueror and type and Conqueror,
whatever, just type KFM client, space open,
profile, whatever you call it, too easy.
The other thing you can also do, I think,
is do open URL,
and then type the URL in there,
and open up on that particular webpage.
There's quite a few things you can do with it.
Because that's the web page, too,
it can be a location on your system.
Yeah, that's right, you're fine.
Yeah, that's right, in your directory.
So that's exactly right.
It really is handy, but the other thing,
the reason I like it the most, obviously,
and I imagine you can do this in Conqueror in KDE,
is when you set up shortcut keys,
like I'll just have Alt Zed,
because they're right there,
so they're the two creatures to hit,
because typically it's what I use the most,
to open up the file manager view,
then I set up another profile,
which I just associate with the keys Alt X,
and you just go through and do that.
And after a while, you just don't even think about it,
and you just hit him in the next minute Conqueror's pop up,
and open the way, exactly the way you want it.
It's just too easy.
And for people who use Name,
do yourself a favor,
and piss off Nautilus,
and start using Conqueror.
So there you go.
The profile is stored.
I don't think there's that many anyway.
I think there's only file management,
and you are real, I think.
But there in your home directory,
.KDE4,
4-slash-air,
4-slash-apps,
4-slash-conquer,
4-slash-profiles,
if you want to know where they're stored,
and go and have a look at them.
Well, web browsing is the other one that's in there.
Yeah, it's web browsing file manager.
I thought they had a split view,
but I could be wrong.
There's KDE development.
Yeah, there's Midnight Commander.
That's the thing.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it's a few web browsing.
It's like five, you're right.
By default, anyway.
Yeah.
But like I said,
take the time,
set up specific ones that you want,
and all of a sudden Conqueror becomes that much better.
Yeah, combine with the keyboard shortcuts,
like you said.
That's pretty cool,
because you can just...
I've got my meta,
and you know,
whatever letter
assigned to all kinds of different things.
It's really fast.
I don't know how easy it is to set those up, you know.
Yeah, you wouldn't think it'd be very hard.
Surely.
Yeah, K,
if I'm client good,
that's a good one.
Yeah, of course,
if you do run those things in a terminal,
once you run them,
they're in your history,
and I'm sure there's a very simple way
to get back through your history
and run them again
without having the type at all.
Would that be right most of it?
Yeah, you can just type history
and grab what you're looking for,
and then just hit the explanation point,
and with the number that it outputs
to the left of it.
It was easy, you know.
Wait, what if that I heard that tip before
and I didn't ever get it?
So it's history,
and then you grab whatever you want.
And then it's going to output it,
and there's going to be a number to the left of it.
Okay.
And it's going to type in the explanation point
in that number,
and then start that command again.
Nice.
Okay.
And you can also use a string
after the explanation.
Like if you put
a bang SSH,
it's going to run the last command
to start with the SSH.
Oh, cool.
So it control R in hash.
And since we're talking about history,
that was my command of the week.
Not actually history,
but just like a little tip for it.
You can add a history time format
to your output.
It's a, see, real quick.
I'll pull it up here.
It's export history time format,
and then just like a regular date type format.
And you can,
you can add,
I'll put this in the show notes
because it's hard to explain.
But you can add this to your,
your bash RC,
or you can,
or you can make it global
and add it to your Etsy slash profile.
So it works on all the users.
You can actually type that in.
Now it will,
it'll start working.
I mean, when you read,
log in,
it won't be there unless you add it to your bash RC,
or your profile.
Wow.
That is really cool.
I did not,
I've never seen that before.
I like that.
I just posted an example of mine.
Oh, I wanted to make sample of Moe.
I got in trouble doing that last night.
But you can get the, you know,
the date code,
you know, for the time format,
you can just do like a man date.
That doesn't, that sounds like some 330 would say.
But you can type in man date.
And you can see all the different time formats.
You know, if you don't want the seconds on there,
or if you don't want the month or the year.
All right.
And what's your command of the week, J-Man?
Mine is a very simple command,
but also very useful.
It's L-S-O-F.
And if you just type it by itself,
it's going to list every open file on the system.
And you can give it a path.
You can say what program has this particular file open right now,
which could help you if you couldn't unmount a device, maybe.
And it does suck it.
You can do dash I-T-C-P.
And it will tell you all the TCP connections.
So, pretty cool.
Wow.
That's just cool.
I have a lot of stuff open.
I had to pipe the L-S command to that one to see everything.
It really gives you an idea of what's going on on your system, actually.
It's a really interesting look at.
All right.
That was a bunch of cool commands.
I just noticed in the chatroom,
330 said Nodless is shit.
I thought he was a big fan of Nodless.
I thought he was all about Nodless all the time.
But what I heard.
I thought once you know how to build out the impackages,
you mature enough to say goodbye to Nodless.
Yeah.
So, if anybody wants to know what kind of package he made,
just drop into the Linux Cranks IRC on FreeNode and ask 330.
Is there a place you can download it?
Not yet.
I've got to put it up somewhere for when I reinstall.
But since you guys are making fun of me,
I'll go ahead and tell everybody how to do it since it's a command.
And it'll be the first time I've done a command of a week, I think.
Just being a recent convert to Fedora,
I didn't know any of this shit was possible.
Because I had been under the assumption for years that people that used
RPM-based systems were either retarded or just didn't know better.
Because no one had told me that this existed.
But if you take a source RPM,
which I'm still not exactly sure why they exist,
because all it is is the source code and a spec file.
But I'm sure that I'll get an email about why they exist.
And I'll still be confused because I'm still a huge RPM noob.
But there's this thing called RPM build.
And if you do RPM build space, dash, dash, rebuild,
and then the package name dot source dot RPM,
it'll spit out just a regular RPM.
It's often like that.
What does it say? It says,
I mean, what does it name it?
Does it say I 586 or something?
Yeah, that's what mine spit out.
Okay, yeah, that's pretty cool.
Yeah, you can do a similar thing in Debian when you're compiling.
If you do check install instead of make install,
and it'll go through and do all the dependencies,
you know, tell you all your dependencies that you need,
and then spit out a dev package,
which is actually kind of nice when you're building something
for someone who has no idea how to compile software.
And you're like, dude, just hold on, I'll do it,
and you can download this.
But yeah, I was excited because I actually got something
to work the first time playing with it in Fedora.
So I was over excited about my minor achievement.
And it can't be overexcited about your own achievement.
It's cool, it's really neat.
Well, I get excited that I put pants on every day too.
Okay, you're right, you can't get too excited.
That's a mere achievement.
But I put them on myself.
I mean, there were two legs.
I mean, come on.
Give me a break here, all right?
Well, I've been doing it for like 24 years,
and it's not a big deal.
Except for it is, it's a huge deal.
Yeah, that was my minor achievement of the week
and full thing that I did.
And if anyone needs an RPM for BT scanner,
they should just email me because I've got one.
Actually, I wouldn't mind getting that 330.
Count building a bloody self-cloud to you,
not having that.
That'd be so lazy.
Well, I think, didn't you say that it was hard to find that
source RPM 330?
It was kind of a pain.
It was in a way off the beaten path.
I actually didn't find the source RPM.
Somebody in Hash Fedora did.
Yeah, so it doesn't sound like it's just like
sitting around necessarily.
I mean, I'm sure I could find it,
but I mean, if you've got it,
it would be kind of easy to just grab it from you.
Then I'll be hosting the RPM that I built,
you know, my minor achievement and all.
The source RPM I used and the actual tarball,
if people don't trust me, they can just get the tarball
and look at it.
Because I wouldn't trust me.
I mean, how I was excited that, yeah,
I used RPM built.
I'm hoping now that the entire world knows
Peter and Jay Lynch, you'll get off my ass.
Probably not.
I was going to say not likely.
You guys still have a whole bag of stones to throw.
Not until, not until Zote comes back.
You'll read, you've been tagged.
I've got to get him sacked from that job.
Or bring Peggy Sue on.
I mean, shit.
I wear a different shirt at least once a week.
That gets to wear in the tilt shirt he was given.
Hey, Claught, too.
I listened to the bad apples.
And you mentioned that you're a slacker media project?
Yes, yes it is.
Checking out the website now looks really nice.
Yeah, well, thanks for the logo.
Oh, that was nothing.
Yeah, it's coming along pretty nicely.
Actually, I've been working at it fairly diligently.
So there's still a lot of stuff to be to be worked on.
But it's a real time kernel issues and stuff like that.
But yeah, it's pretty cool.
Then where is this logo?
It goes blackermedia.info.
And you will see the logo that Monster B designed
at the very top.
That page is actually my minor achievement thing
that I was all excited about because I actually did it from scratch
with a proper like, you know, capgating style sheet
that wasn't embedded in the HTML page.
You know, it probably doesn't look right on all browsers.
But because I don't, I still don't get that whole relative font size thing.
But, you know, it's cool.
It's fun.
That's pretty good.
Oh, cool.
It's better in my website.
So, and you mentioned that the slacker media.info domain
you're just going to let it expire after a year?
Yeah, probably.
I mean, it was only 89 cents to get.
So, really, it's straightedgelinux.com slash slacker media.
That domain I've had for a while, and we'll continue to have.
So, that's a good name, though, slacker media?
Well, maybe I'll get slackermedia.com at that point or something.
Or maybe I'll renew it.
Who knows?
What we'll see?
Well, before I end this show, anything else?
Everybody's tired from their Halloween festivities.
And Windows 7 parties.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe we had eight trick-or-treaters this year.
And six of them showed up on a tractor.
So, you're doing better than me.
The only one I had was Peggy Sue.
And he lives here.
Not the pumpkin with the hole on the side.
We don't discuss that anymore.
Not since the lawsuit.
Well, I think it's a good time to end the show.
And that's disgusting, though.
Well, thanks, everyone, for joining me, and thanks for listening.
And I'll talk to you guys in a couple weeks.
Hey, thanks for having us, Monster Beef.
Say hi, Zlida.
Hi, everybody.
Good night.
Come on, J-Man.
Oh, good night.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Gotta make that end of every shower again.
can cranks and be it always with the Jaymeet.
Yeah, really.
That can be, yeah. What is it, legacy?
Oh, what do you call it?
Tradition.
Yeah.
Something like that.
And the Jayman's case is latency.
Thank you.
I know you want me.
And I'm right within your reach.
I know you know me.
And I need some company.
I know you some me.
When you walk through that door,
And now you got me.
What are you waiting for?
And I do against all this.
Don't ask for it when I go down.
Don't you miss me just as much as I miss you?
Hold another round and let me hold you.
I don't even need a ring on my head.
Don't walk within the world.
Just as risky care.
How dare you help me?
Just look at you now.
Can you live without me?
Yes, you've finally figured out before what you're done.
But with me, you feel no pain before the future.
But how long will you kill the great?
And I call against all this.
I'm sorry, when I go down.
I'm so glad you want to give me one more chance.
Hold another round and let me hold you.
I don't even need a ring on my head.
Don't walk within the world.
Hold you tight.
Just as risky care.
I forgive you for all those times you touch me.
Now what I've got you, you won't get away from me.
But I can look in your lips.
Don't I burn when I go down?
Don't you wish you could lift me?
But you can't.
Hold another round and let me hold you.
I don't even need a ring on my head.
Don't walk within the world.
Hold your tight.
Just as risky care.
Now what I've got you, you won't get away from me.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
Hold your tight.
