This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4,049 for Thursday 8 February 2024.
Today's show is entitled What's in my Bag January 2024.
It is hosted by Swift 110 and is about 10 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is I describe when I carry on a day-to-day basis.
Hello everybody, it's me again, it's Swift 110.
Been at this a few years now.
It's been a while since I've actually recorded on here.
Thought I'd go ahead and start doing more, I guess I'll make up for lost time and
go through my phones and see what I've recorded previously.
Go ahead and finally post them on here.
I mean they're not exactly time-sensitive information after all.
So that'll be something to look forward to for sure.
You'll be hearing a lot more from me in the future, so hopefully you like my voice.
I'm sorry that my voice is a little trash right now.
It's just from being extremely happy and talking a lot of work.
I was able to go skating last night and that was very exciting as well.
So hey, it is what it is.
I'll take a sip of this water, see if that helps.
Who knows.
Okay.
It's not so pretty good.
What am I going to talk about today?
Let's do an installment of What's in my Bag.
Well, what's normally in my bag these days are the following.
15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro, which means obviously I'm going to carry its power cable and adapter,
power adapter with it.
So boom, that's two items right there.
I'm going to also carry my iPad 9.
Again, that has a cable, it's an adapter at the end, so I can make sure to charge that
up whenever necessary, thankfully it's rare.
But I'm able to do that with the iPad, okay, great iPad and charger.
I also have a second cable that I got for pretty cheap, really, really light.
So I just carry that with me just in case I have another Apple device or somebody else needs to use it.
I have that just in case they are.
What else do I have?
Let's think about it.
Okay.
So I have a multi-point multi-point multi-point multi-point multi-point multi-power adapter.
That's in the shape of a cube that I got from Target.
Thank you, Target.
I'm not the best sponsor of this particular recording.
But just a shout out nonetheless, because they hooked me up with that thing.
It comes in really handy when you need to have several plugs for different devices.
You know, you go to, you ever been to a coffee shop and they just don't have that many areas
to plug in your laptop, your phone or whatnot.
And it's nice to be able to add plugs and just make it more of a better experience for everybody involved.
Okay, great.
I also carry actually what I'm going to start carrying is at least two USB-C cables.
It overkill, but right now I have a four foot, four to six feet.
No, that was a six.
No, it was a four foot or something like that.
USB cable, that's pretty nice.
Like a braided cloth, USB-C cable, the USB-A and the other end.
I plan on getting another six foot cable pretty soon.
That'll be coming handy.
And those coming handy.
Now that I've started just using the short little cables, probably a lot of foot long.
That's all I really need for a USB-C cable to charge my phone at night.
Just plug that into my MacBook Pro and just, when I'm going to go,
it's really convenient to use as well.
And so pretty much cables, laser charge, my iPad, as well as my MacBook Pro.
And then of course, I'll carry clothing, you know, usually shirts underwear for, you know, at least two of each.
And I tend to pack those.
I fold those a certain way and then put the laptop on them.
And it helps the cushion, the laptop, the bottom of the bag, because there is no other cushioning available in that manner.
So that comes in real handy as well.
In fact, that reminds me, I wanted to go to a store in New Year market today.
Because I don't have to be at work for a while.
This is quite the day to get on over there and see what they got.
It may have something I need that I could really use that will help me in the day to day life.
So we'll work that out for sure.
But also, I'm not going to have it in my bag.
My USB drives, my Ventoy stick, a couple of other drives.
I got my resume on it.
So I try to have big enough drives.
But if I need to download operating systems, swap them out or whatnot, I'm able to do so.
Transfer files from computer to computer when I don't want to do it wirelessly.
Because as much as I love KDE Connect, it can take a little time.
And I could just transfer a boom and drop and be done using the sleeping net.
It's always a good thing to have options for sure.
The bag I use is a simple $12 bag that I got from actually one of those discount stores.
The Titanium market.
I'm really grateful to have it.
Hopefully, it'll last at least long enough.
The bag I really, really want is from Timbuktu.
And when I go get that, that'll be something nice.
I currently have a messenger bag from them that I got.
Boom, and like 2012.
And boy, it's been through it.
So what I'm hoping is that they'll come through with their lifetime guarantee, warranty one thing.
And that probably is able to get a brand new bag.
That'll be amazing.
So there's a couple of things I'm trying to work on in the future.
Because I like, you know, you want to have a good bag, the sturdy, this waterproof.
That's actually going to last.
The last thing you want to do, oh my goodness, and I've had this happen time and time again,
is that one of the straps breaks.
Those are all valid.
You definitely don't want that.
And so I'm trying to avoid having that issue happen at all.
And so just kind of working on various upgrades.
Now regarding the woods in my bag right now, the laptop by itself is
a little over four pounds, four and a half pounds rather niche.
And I've had by itself as a pound and you factor in the charging cables and stuff.
That's probably another pound, which we had all that together.
And a little bit of clothing, you know, that's quite a bit when you're carrying it.
You know, walk a lot and you're going to go a lot as much as I am.
You just want to make it a lighter and a compact kind of scenario.
And so I look forward to getting a 13 inch framework laptop.
That'll be amazing because that's nearly three pounds, but that takes a pound and a half
off of what I'm already carrying.
And that will be absolutely superb.
Just having that dollar machine, you know, it does mean a little smaller over screen.
And I think it's a better screen that I have in my book.
Well, and definitely I'll get a much better, I'll get a better battery life out of it.
And having a machine will be faster and better as well.
I have to actually do a benchmark and compare the two because that one's using the
new processor, you know, versus the HQ processor that's been this 2015 that good.
The way for me to get a much better CPU, of course, really get the framework 16.
And all that one's kind of heavy, but it's also kind of expensive.
I could use it because I would really be spurging.
And so we'll see how things play out into the future.
But yeah, this has been an episode of installment rather of what's in my bag.
I'll be adjusting things periodically so that the function better, stay neat.
And of course, have a lighter weight that I'm carrying around.
It's 4.5 pounds.
It can be a bit much.
It's not horrible.
I'm definitely not doing what I used to do where I would actually carry a T420 and an X201
along with an iPad at the same time.
And all the charging things that go along with that.
So at least I'm, I've gotten better.
See, at the time, I would go out and about do what I need to do, travel by Airbnb.
And it would be a situation where I just couldn't choose which laptop I wanted to carry.
And so I would just say, hey, I'll carry both the modes of the library and walk with it like that.
And that was fantastic and all.
But I'm a little bit older, I guess a little wiser and just don't want to do that anymore.
The only thing is I really, really prefer using Linux machines.
It's nice as Apple is and things I can do without thinking about it.
And Apple, I got to go look it up and whatnot.
And so, you know, getting back to a Linux daily kind of program would be amazing.
Well, it's all I got to say for right now.
This has been Swift 110.
And I hope you guys have a fantastic day.
Another installment of what's in my bag.
You guys take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye.
