Okay.
So we can't do that.
Okay.
I have no further intuitive explanation.
He is Also Intrue.
Don't play, never knew, never knew...
They have everything suspicious of me, a person who's going for business, then there're
people.
I'm glad that we can help with it is my son and the hospital that I know what that's called.
What does that encourage me to tell you?
The GMT website is in Greenwich.
No, what time is that?
Mine is 7.
Mine is in it.
Is it 5?
No, it's in.
It changes.
I don't know if that's the right time.
It's not necessary.
We were trying to figure that out earlier today.
We could do it.
We're going to go go tell you.
We are going to go to Greenwich.
It's 5.
So I have a problem in either 9 or 10.
I think that is a lot of work.
That's all right.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
In the past two weeks I've either been moving in or moving out.
And I'm packing.
I'm going to grasp.
I'm going to grasp.
I'm going to grasp.
I'm going to move in just a couple of minutes.
Especially when you're on the second floor of the apartment.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's right.
You got to do a move.
You got to do a third.
Your six went ahead, and then you.
I got go.
And of course we put it in first.
When we moved out.
So when we were moving in it was the last thing left.
And yeah, you higher.
Yeah.
I got higher.
Yeah.
You higher.
Yeah.
You don't get hanged right now.
Yeah.
The commercial where it's different is probably in a movie.
It's poorly made something from Mary.
and they got me down to the wheelchair and they put me on camera so I have these guys.
Or things.
Hey, we could have moved like a guy in my place.
Yeah, that's...
I've been moving, yeah.
And I was going to go there and come there.
Is that...
Are you ready?
We ended up a projector, so...
What else offered you?
I had, uh, well, a movie here.
How about entering the rock, you know?
What's that library?
Look at that.
A movie.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
People try to avoid that.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup, yup.
We put a gun on it.
We actually put that on a gun up there too.
Yeah.
No.
And we should have...
Well, I mean, I actually got smarter.
We got one from one side of the other, from the other side.
There's no way around this.
Did you put a video camera?
Yup.
Did you do that?
Yup.
Yup.
Then I never...
Who are we?
All the people.
Oh, no.
We got a banner.
Yup.
Those...
Yeah, six dollars.
Six dollars.
Six dollars.
It was very good actually.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll see if that...
Byron had an idea to have a candy.
But the candy didn't have a candy.
Oh, that would have gotten there.
It actually had the big balloons.
No.
Six dollars.
Something happened.
Yeah, it's not bad.
It's really a nice weather.
Yeah.
It was beautiful weather.
It was...
There was international festival.
It was an enormous, terrible practice of library.
Yeah.
There was like, people like pig zoos now.
And the library had a library sale, pig sale.
No.
So, uh...
There was a lot of time to do it.
So, somehow, by accident, you could put it there.
It didn't take the day.
Oh, you didn't know?
You didn't know that festival would go on, huh?
No.
No.
Not even the...
There was a book set.
No, we don't know.
That's worldwide that day.
Yeah.
But you can't see how we can't adjust it on your own.
You can go on a Friday.
You know.
Everybody's going to go on a Saturday.
And they do a Friday.
So, you...
It's up to you.
It's up to you.
You know what, everybody?
We'll look at TV 13 to see whether anything showed up on the channel.
No, it is going to be on a Friday.
It is on a Friday.
That's on a Friday.
That's on a clock.
It's on a clock.
10 a.m.
Oh, they're coming in.
10 a.m.?
10 a.m.
Yeah.
I'll be on there.
Yeah.
So, tape it.
We would have another...
A little bit of a quick answer.
The reward that I will come to you.
10 a.m.
Yeah.
So...
Come down there, like this.
All right.
Wow.
You'd link to it.
You'd be 13 tape it.
Then you are she's not on the right street.
You know, not on the street.
But you could link to it.
You could link it?
Yeah, you could link it.
But it'll only be there for 200 meltdowns.
Yeah.
And then it's over.
And it's not done.
You can't use anywhere.
Okay.
Okay.
March.
Where old news comes first on Monday.
You're not.
Okay.
So, shall we go over to do a minute or so thing?
You're right.
Cool.
There was one whole thing.
Somebody was asking me actually about four days of hard recording.
They were saying that they might listen to it, but yeah,
we don't really know the quality of the recording.
We need more microphones today.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Yeah.
Why do they have to add those blanks?
That's right.
Pressor or limiter?
No.
That should be good enough.
I can go get this down to one word.
My name is...
I was going to be liners.
I'm going to get more of those.
Yeah, but we'll do it later.
Yeah.
You're going to say that you can have your hands.
You can have your hands.
You can have your hands.
You can have your hands.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Pressor.
Pressor.
He's fantastic.
After doing, you follow up four feet.
I think that's what I noticed.
It could be brilliant or not.
So go over the controls.
What else do you want?
My name is Gary Arahman.
Then putting together a web page and trying to get the whole show figured out on the
arena.
I guess not green, but it's cascading spreadsheets and style sheets and all my cash are a lot
of stuff going on right now.
You know, from parents to 10 years old, yeah, it's the actual bell, so don't get back,
I don't understand the data.
I think the style sheets are going away in about five years anyway if they haven't,
if they're not already starting to, they're really not that good, so something better,
I hope.
And I do it all by the way.
No.
No.
So I don't know.
So I don't know.
So you think they're fixing all the other places?
Yeah.
They're the whole page that we completely flash.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just saying that.
That's an idea.
They opened it up.
I think that would be great.
Everything's going to be great.
Everything's going to be great.
Well, you can make a lot of nice inner bases with flash, so compared to HD now.
It's been interactive.
Interactive.
Interactive.
It could be good.
Yeah.
Well.
Right.
I'm going to use it myself.
More times than not.
I've needed like video drivers for my PC and where do you got to go?
I got to go to the ATI's website.
All right.
I don't have graphics.
Well, let's see.
Look at these e-links.
You know, text-based browser.
I get to their site.
And they use all this JavaScript graphics.
Right.
What do I need?
You know, I go to the other PC, you can go to the pen drive and copy it over.
Let's see.
That's fine.
That's fine.
The business site works just fine.
Yeah.
olha, they put away the suspect.
Probably the best platform.
Yeah.
Yes.
What's going to be best find a natural CSS like platformed flash.
There's a company on site.
So we have a camp use helmet or a tool page��� or anything.
And it's a problem with the Internet.
Hey.
Just to use a lot of activities.
Yes.
Quite interesting.
I'm just giving like the pieces are all, yeah.
10 a.m.
Yeah, but a little section like, you know, you have the tables for comments and I think that it's not bad.
They also are calling all over the page, and it's calling you my problem.
But every part of it is quite a little before.
It's still quite normal.
I don't know what it is.
Where are we going to talk to?
It's really amazing.
I know.
I'll put everything in the classroom.
So the bottom line is,
you're older than you get when more you realize you really don't know much about your life.
Let's say this world computer goes out of the way.
That's why you draw the line and say,
it's kind of like, you know that, you know that.
This is really, you know that.
It's not real problem.
You know, because you know what I mean.
It's not real problem.
You know, because I don't wanna get it from you.
This is an aim of the thing that calls for comments.
What's the other thing that starts into YouTube.com.
That's an experience we...
I don't know.
So the whole page is read, it seems to be a set of elements, it's by, you know, the
original, uh, uh, direct, uh, or that new replacement. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Drive, you have to get driver's order, you have to update what's constantly going on. Go literally,
you two got one on the floor. I think that's the way. So, that's what it is. Yeah. It's like it from the
preachers. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is.
Yeah that is. Yeah, that is. Yeah, that is.
If you moved CSS change that the election Provinces takes an old not loved one.
All right. So much of that.
How are you guys?
Nice to meet you.
Cool.
A few minutes.
Go.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
You can monitor.
That's the best thing I've ever seen.
Yeah.
You're fine.
I'm just kidding me.
Of course.
The ride vlog.
It works fine.
I mean, I agree because I have a dual monitor.
But I hope my computer requires some stuff.
I've got a...
You can be more there.
A little basement.
I've hooked up.
But I also have a look at some analyses.
You can see what else in that look it gets.
You can play games and make games and whatnot.
You can shake it or it's...
You can see what I'm talking about.
It's related.
It's modern books.
You're an editor.
It's only a bit different resolutions.
You know what I mean?
You know, really.
It do be a driver.
They try not bad.
You basically will never miss that look.
You can do this.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a man.
You're a man.
I ain't saying it.
You.
Yeah.
You're the one who talks a lot.
It's obvious you're just gonna...
They just being them.
They just being off to the stage.
She logicous voice power.
Oh, you introduced a round?
Okay, that's all I have to get out of stage.
You're gonna be out of stage soon?
I was actually passing by, of my home road, this weekend.
and some people in order to talk about the six-pack, how much to do in the end of the year?
I got, I got really less than 48 hours.
So for our case, there are two cases, two cases of fear.
You should have a little bit more than that.
They have a positive effect on you.
Well, it's a sweet, liquid effect.
Now, it's their value, isn't it?
Well, it's not completely natural because it's not carbonated.
So it's different.
The absence of the film from the viewer.
You're good.
You have to wait there for the anticipation for the whole week or two weeks.
Oh, I can try it right now.
So, I was distracted.
Uh, tired currently, but good.
At the end, I'm interviewing today, so...
The, the viewer and the job?
It was, it was a temporary job.
Okay.
I was on the train, you released back.
Oh, darn thing.
Not you getting, not you getting pregnant again?
That's where she came in.
You should write for her.
It's amazing.
So, uh, if you can say, uh, where did you have an interview?
It's in Pasco.
Oh, that's for one person.
It's up to 35 minutes.
Is it?
30 minutes for an interview.
Only five more minutes.
They don't have kids here.
So, they don't have kids here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's...
Oh, Stanley's got it all set up.
Maybe it's a good product.
Please have a date here.
Rick, for you turn it into the hospital parking lot.
It's a date right here.
Sure.
Oh, that's convenient.
It's not convenient right now.
Yeah.
Hold on, X.
If you take X.
Hold straight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do we?
Yeah.
What is it?
Oh.
Yeah.
It's a little whizzed.
Yeah.
So, what's the store called by there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's called the store.
So, you can have a lunch in the store.
At the store food oil.
Yeah.
You have a whole day.
I told you food in the store.
The store food oil.
The store food oil.
The restaurant.
The freeway.
Yeah.
You gotta see the sign.
You gotta stop there sometimes.
A lot of fun.
Is it?
Yeah.
Well, we went in there.
There was only about 20% of the place poll.
All the other tables still had dirty dishes on them from the previous people.
And they said they didn't have any tables yet.
So, we had to wait a while.
And then when we sat down with this old gal was cleaning off a table.
And she had one with push carts.
You know, and she was cleaning.
And when we walked in, she was starting to clean this table.
And it took forever to get our food one.
After we ate and left, she was still cleaning that same thing.
She didn't quite have a dungeon.
Maybe.
Yeah, and she was the only person doing that in the place.
She was probably older.
Could be.
Could be.
So, if you're not very.
Yes, the place.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I guess it wasn't that or not.
So, did you have anything else?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Did you have anything else?
Did you have anything else?
How did you enjoy your summer freeway?
Too heavy.
Too heavy people?
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have, if we had our most awarded salesman to buy there.
I even see the ones that have slipped under a tree.
I see.
For the malls.
How did you enjoy your summer freeway?
I don't know.
I might be good at giving things like that out, but I don't like doing it.
Yeah.
Um, you know, I think that if they were to stick around there for a long period of time,
you know, they would be giving, you could give away all of them and see these things.
Yeah.
That's why salespeople get paid, price to you.
That's true.
It's a taxing job.
It is.
It is.
But, you know, if we were to give them this way.
If we were to do it next year, you know, I think what we should do is that,
that we should actually have more people coming there at the same time.
But, you know, it was a $2 and a $1 and a $1 and a $1.
It's set of turnstiles and anyone going in the library has to go through those.
Yeah.
Well, it might be, it might be to, you know, you could have a beer tent.
Ooh.
Yeah.
For sure about all that work.
Especially, Mr. Oh, there was a guy.
He was, he started talking and thought, blah, blah, blah.
And then he came in his field.
He's been in his field.
He was saying, oh, I'm all quiet.
He used to be such a beautiful sit.
You know, we had everything here.
We had the best cheese and the best beer.
And I was just fantastic, you know.
And then, I think, for you, he's your girlfriend.
You know, I think I've always lived on a moment in there.
And then they know I work right now.
This is what it is right now.
I'm not sure if they had met King.
I wasn't sure if I should make a collection bit.
Oh, man.
That wasn't a point.
Yeah, after that, I couldn't ask.
I wanted to send him out.
You know, I was weird.
Yeah, I just couldn't shake him.
Yeah.
Is anybody alive right now that I got used to?
Yes, yes, yes.
He was telling me that some country had the biggest inflation ever.
And I used to live there.
Somehow, I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
You're calmness.
Yes, absolutely.
You can't shake because that's what you were doing.
You were born that way.
That's what it is.
He probably just locked it in the group home.
Somebody was looking for him.
Yeah, that.
So, we got a couple of them.
We got only two people who knew something about Linux.
They call it Linux.
Linux.
That's what we heard about Linux.
And most of the people, you know, we made a Windows CD.
And most of the people we just recently.
And so, I think that our target audience was right.
Yeah.
I don't think that we will ever be able to just pass Linux.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
No.
It's a very...
It's a very...
It's a very...
It's a very...
It's a very...
So, anyway, other stuff.
About a battery backup.
That's kind of cool.
It's got the USB plug-in.
It's a password on the box.
It's a password on the box.
Cool.
Cool.
I've got to get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, it's got to be in a face that, you know, keeps track of all ages and everything.
It tells the PC how much battery power is left in it.
There's a little applet, great panel that monitors it.
If the battery gets too old and automatically shuts down the PC, you know the girl.
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah.
Today, actually, Mr. Excel Energy Man came and he was saying,
I'm going to replace your meter.
Slunk.
Down.
Down.
Down.
And then, really skulls, and he said,
is there a server down?
I said, I don't know, but I know that Mr. Energy.
I don't know, but the power's out.
The server likes to be runnin'.
So, I had to come help this guy.
And the help has needed the proper reset button.
You don't have to start back up.
What's your opinion on how to manage the answer to the question?
I do.
Absolutely.
I have two CDs to see.
Yes, I do.
I have two disks aligned from there.
I actually have a power line lots of people on it.
You know, just in case.
Just in case.
I don't know.
You did your disaster recovery plan and worked out so long ago.
No, no.
I told my technical support.
Well, you shouldn't have to make the call.
They should automatically get paid.
They did not get paid.
That's how I worked out.
It was an undetected power outage.
And you have a flashlight on it.
It's going to be a clear.
Yeah, it is.
What is on it?
A church.
A church.
You can do it on that.
You can get a power recovery church.
I have a lot of my...
I take you so far.
My technical support at the first would have to find out that server is the product.
And that's not very high in priority with my technical support.
I'll try to support people like that.
I didn't wait three days for them to remove the system from the domain.
The final work in the building.
So, how I...
What is I said in a little tired?
Everybody in your house.
No penguin on it, but the penguin's in it.
But it's got a bear on it.
I see many possibilities to come things to try out and put in.
Not enough money to do it, but a lot of come things to try.
I guess the noise will be your friend.
Sometimes.
I will be spending some paychecks there, I'm sure.
I know.
Then new egg and Cisco.
Why does everything Cisco have to cost like a minimum of $500?
It's a shipping.
It's a box.
That's how much the box costs.
Yes.
But...
You know, I just got my internet back.
Yeah, I've been going with about a week without it.
A little bit of withdrawals getting the shakes on me.
Okay.
Why am I slashed out of fixing work?
So, why are the items going up and down?
What?
My internet?
Yeah.
For some reason, well, when I moved, I showed it down.
I took some few days to move.
Everything for some reason.
And I just plugged in yesterday.
For some reason, my modem defaulted back to a standard modem, P-P-O-E.
So, it wasn't bridging anymore.
My router didn't know what to do with that.
I'm like, oh, okay.
I decided to mess it with yesterday after a few 30 minutes of thinking about it today.
I'm like, all right, I'll plug directly into it.
Yeah, for some reason, the modem just randomly decided to go back to normal mod as it called the bridge.
This is a default.
It might not have a persistent story.
I almost have to really power it up for a long time, because that's, you know,
I'd have to make it out of power stuff like that before.
Sometimes it powers, but I'm not going to have to end here.
Maybe, but it's going to, it was unplugged for, I mean, it worked fine.
And then I unplugged it.
I plugged it in.
No.
So, I don't know.
It's just kind of odd.
Maybe they do have like an extra long capacitor in there.
And after a few days, they move default to back.
Because, you know, if it is persistent storage, then it just does.
Yeah, I don't know, a little odd.
I always have to much else going on.
I'm leaving for San Francisco on Sunday for a week of training.
Not on when it's unfortunate.
I got to deal with some Microsoft product.
Yeah, I'll close our eyes if you go to San Francisco.
I wish I had time to enjoy San Francisco.
Oh, this is just a thing with a capacitor.
Yeah, never been that side.
I've never been that side.
I've never been that side.
No, you're not.
Okay.
I'm not saying.
No, it's just a thing.
There's a lot of good food in that town.
I hope so.
There's still like, it's a little few more beautiful things.
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not sure.
There's a lot of diversity.
Yeah, a lot of diversity, right?
I'll be driving around the car.
Yeah, actually, you might have been driving a lot in San Francisco.
I went through a Japanese market there.
We're going to be the training isn't actually right in.
Well, San Jose San Jose San Jose San Jose San Jose.
I'll be flying in San Jose.
And I'll be driving past Great America every day,
which can't kind of be unfair,
because it would be like,
I was going past it at 8 a.m.
Coming back at 8.30 p.m.
You're kind of training me getting a window.
It's a window.
It's like an enterprise.
So it's windows visit, enterprise trainings,
or Microsoft certification.
Oh, you're lucky, isn't it?
Yeah, I kind of stumbled into it.
I'll take it.
Yeah, that works paid for it all.
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
I'll go to San Francisco for seven days.
I'll get a few hours and on Sunday of the last,
you know, do whatever I want.
Yeah, it's very nice.
It's finished.
Maybe you'll get the kind of trainer
that just is off.
Take the afternoon off.
Yeah.
Oh, I'd be nice, but I doubt it.
Sometimes it happens.
From what I was told,
these are five, 12 hour days.
You are there all the time.
And you pay to be there the whole time.
Yeah.
You were watching a video and something.
You were on Seattle.
Weak yourself.
And one of the road ahead grants.
Okay.
10, 15 years old.
And you're busy for 12 hours.
And then your food is set up every day,
while by the end of the week,
you're like, we don't want to eat in a hotel.
We're getting out of here.
And the cook felt terribly.
I think he was scared.
Everybody awake, isn't it?
Food.
You know, the thing is,
when we get out,
he's going to eat somewhere just to get out of the place.
Yeah.
But they're going all day long.
Is that it?
That's it.
That's plenty.
That's plenty.
That's plenty.
How are you?
I just enjoy my myth box.
I think they're all great.
Nifty.
And kind of thinking more on the lines,
what Byron just brought up.
The one word he was talking about money.
I was thinking about that for organization.
And all that.
If you want to continue doing things like that,
which we should, which is great.
But maybe we should find some way of getting it right on the street.
And I'm thinking maybe,
what's that?
Yeah.
And not membership fees or anything like that,
but somehow like maybe an affiliation program on our website.
And I don't know what SBC or AT&T's contract says,
but maybe just put ads on it.
I don't know what it doesn't.
Maybe that's what we wanted to do.
I just thought that I'm thinking about that.
If you want to continue doing big events,
like software freeing data,
if you're going to need money to do one.
Yeah.
It is money.
On the other side,
a lot of corporations will not get your money
because we are not proper organizations.
We are not the programs.
We can't write it off.
We cannot write it off.
So then how much hassle do you want to go
to become to be a stock nonprofit organization?
And then you are overhead now.
A lot for me,
for us all.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
You need people.
You pay as you go.
You pay for food.
You pay for food.
You pay for drinks.
You need on a maybe outcome basis.
You know, it is well required.
And I think that's why it was pretty successful here.
It was the first three people.
And it's not going to be a certain big people here.
So I don't want to put any edits on the website
because I want to write.
Yeah.
I know.
I hear what you're saying.
It's just that if,
at some point,
that comes up in every organization I think,
I'm going to do something.
You could do a big sale.
Well, I know that.
I can bake.
I can bake.
I can bake.
I can bake.
I can bake.
But I can't.
He's not a mixer.
Right.
I thought, you know,
I self-organizing,
such as the free and rate.
Even though it was some money,
it must have cooled.
Because it wasn't just my income.
You know?
No.
It was, it was our income.
And we worked together.
And then, you know,
I had to leave,
and other people pulled it together
and had the stuff done,
and the flyer done,
and had the CV stuff done,
and print it.
And image done.
So, on one side,
it was $100.
So, it wasn't a lot of money.
Not really.
You know, it's not that terrible.
I mean,
it would be $100.
But right now,
we have one of the people here.
I mean, everybody would give $10.
You know, we can do it at all.
No, no, I agree.
But, you know, there's a different,
something you can do more events like that.
You don't, you don't want to,
you don't want to do,
you don't want to come to,
I need to have a job
because I have a car.
I have a car because I need to have a job.
You know?
Yeah.
It's a typical teenage,
why they have a job,
because they want to have a car.
They want to have a car.
They need to have a car because they need to have a good, good, good job.
So, you know,
it's a robbery.
Is there a robbery?
Well, yeah.
It's just some,
the thought I was thinking about.
I mean,
I'm not agree that, you know,
the relaxed atmosphere
of the organized,
it's nice to have.
Definitely?
No, good.
You know,
we can think what we,
you know,
how many people bought a shirt that,
like,
they paid for it.
Now,
they,
that's the only people who bought a shirt.
So, if you want to sell a shirt,
then I feel,
if you want to sell a shirt with the support of Mark,
then just give me,
give me those $13.
Okay?
Yes.
No.
It's not,
probably,
you know,
no, no, I,
but there's, you know,
it was just a thought.
You know,
I mean, we don't really, you know,
there's something to think about.
There's something like,
right now we,
you know,
I don't go,
you know,
I know it.
You pay as you buy,
you know,
and,
if you go,
have money,
then you don't go.
You know,
it's your,
it's your,
it's your future,
or something,
you know.
Sure,
okay.
We can pay all of them
and we can,
we can.
We can~!!
Buy our shares in a multi stream.
$15 is on $20.
Is it, is it anybody own,
actually made money
on Google ads,
does anybody actually
gotten a cheque
from Google for,
do you need
$100.
Bangdaldü rey
for,
the operating bill,
yes.
Well, when I had ,
when, when you used to be $15,
as soon as I had,
$4.99 they raised it to like $100, so I'm just wondering if that just keeps going, you know, they just keep going at one step further, like you know.
The question is that they can discontinue your account or any time you want.
So let's say I know about a guy who already cashed once, $100, and then he was putting it on the next time, and they said,
because you said XYZ, you're going to be supposed to be encouraged on the left, right?
Then, yeah, holding your account?
I guess.
So then you are trying to change the tail as you wouldn't set anything offensive because you already have $95.00 today.
When they click on it, they click the ad on your page, and you put in the code on your page that connects to Google's servers, and they look at your page,
and they pick words out of it, and place ads.
Different ads each time you load the page, they place them depending on what the content of your page is, and if somebody clicks on it,
those people have paid for Google to place their ads, so like, say, say you have an ad for ice cream or something, so they click on it.
So you put an ad on your page that's linked to Google?
You're basically just putting some links on it, and it puts an ad into your account.
Yeah, right.
And there's affiliation programs too, so like, say, target.
Say you put an ad on your page for target, you can sign up for their affiliation program, so if someone picks on the banner on your page and buys something,
because if it's a cookie on that computer, then it tracks that, then target will give you a tip back, or say, Amazon is famous for that too.
And I'll give you a tip back, you know, it's called affiliation program.
And a lot of companies do it to get traffic to their website.
So if someone, you know, has cookies turned on and they go through your link, and they eventually buy something, and you get a 2-3 bucks back.
Yeah, like people that write book reviews, and then they'll have the link to Amazon.
That's why I left some.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
Yeah.
What do you tell them it's a book sale?
Yeah.
Why are you organizing?
No, I...
I was just...
Something to think about, because...
Yes.
Because...
You know, it goes...
It goes, you know, how much effort you want to spend.
Yeah.
Is it worth it, you know?
Is it worth it?
You know, five days of organizing.
Is it worth it for $100?
No.
You know, because the date sale will give you a bit, you know.
What do you think now is funny about what you get?
Well, not a big sale.
Yeah, I was just wondering why.
Yeah.
That's a big sale.
Look at people.
But not too much, because...
But something that should be not bad, because...
No, I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
That is money-raising plan.
No.
That's fine.
I got it.
No, I'm fine with doing that.
I got a problem with this...
You know, maybe other ways to do it too.
Yeah.
Cool.
Sure.
You think of any good ways?
Let me know, because I'm also...
Yeah, I'll do it as a bartender.
What did you say bartender?
No, I'll do it as a bartender.
Oh, bartender.
Oh, you can just make...
Well, it's a big better.
It's a beer sale.
Oh, you can make the penguin beer.
And then just...
You'll need to be a city at the bottom of the bottle.
If you want some beer,
you can make that license.
And you need to go up and down.
And it's not that easy.
As long as waiting in the stomach,
it's great ways.
It's great to win.
So if you want that in a homebrew,
you'll just have to buy out.
You don't try to sell it.
You don't try to sell it.
There's no comment on you.
Low slaughter.
That was a lot longer.
A lot longer.
Bloodlugger.
You don't remember.
You just heard it.
Oh, it's a bloodlugger.
Bloodlugger.
So no slaughter, but a bloodlugger.
Really quick.
Speaking of Google, I just found this on the site.
There's a town in Russia,
which is figured out in the Google Earth salad.
Oh, and overhead.
And they're a little bit behind on the documentation.
But they have a bunch of needs.
People together in the town square,
and we're able to get kids.
Yellow capes.
Yeah.
Yeah, like, oh my goodness.
Big smiley things.
Don't rush people out.
Oh, did you?
Yeah, had you played with that package?
I looked at the SDK for it,
and then I saw that the person learned a job
with everything and got it all excited.
Oh, yeah.
But I think I'm looking for Eclipse.
No example.
I'll be entering Eclipse to the whole world.
Yeah.
Thanks.
But we're going to have to play Eclipse.
How big of a footprint does that require in,
like, saying, your cell phone or whatever you're putting it in?
You know, how big a memory is.
Oh, no, I wouldn't expect that.
Yeah, what do you think about it?
It is, really, the Android is running specialized.
That's what it is.
Really customized.
It's really tweaked again.
Here's why it's so kind of a job.
It's not something that sounds like Java.
It's not something that sounds like Java.
It was coming out with the first ever version.
It just seemed all the way to the PC.
It just seemed all the way to the PC.
That's why it seemed all the way to the PC.
It's coming out like next week.
Oh, you're wrong.
It's got GPS that included in the package.
Yes.
And there is, you know, a footprint there with CPC.
You can see that absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're having a little program for it to stick to the other.
Well, the password is hacking.
That's all they need.
What is your order?
You should write a course log.
And the first day, he was excited about it.
And today, he said, no.
I don't understand that.
Those are a big messages here.
Then he was like, oh, I'm ready to hand go ahead and say,
I'm going to Android.
I'm going to say Android.
See.
I'm going to say Android.
I'm going to Android.
I'm going to Android.
I'm going to Android.
So, I guess I've been running off that squirrel mail on a new box.
And on the old box, I'm thinking.
I think I might have mentioned this last time,
but as I was setting it up, I found that if you have the,
there's different ways to do the sorts.
And if you let the script do the sorting, you know,
like when you click on your headings and your email,
like sort of a date, sort of like, if the script is sorting it,
it's painfully slow.
But if you, but the mail servers are able to do that sorting directly,
like the career or, you know, the top three servers can do that sorting.
Maybe it's just like that.
So now, the old machine is so fast,
I almost didn't need to replace it.
But since I already have the other one,
not I've got the two of them running side by side.
It's like typing in all these R-Sync commands between them.
And I want to just make like a batch file to do that.
And I was talking to you earlier.
I think I know how to do it now.
It was a problem.
It's an exclamation mark that pointed at the shell.
And then just typing in the man, right?
Pretty much it.
And it also supports, you know,
you can do regular programming like you have statements.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
You can do it there.
You can have functions.
So it's regular programming.
Yeah.
I just want to go through a string of R-Sync statements on it.
It has a crime job in the middle of the night or something.
And that's...
I was going to make a shell script.
Yeah.
Going to other crimes and really at home.
And then they can, then I can have the other machine
just as a backup that gets synchronized at night.
So that's probably it.
Oh, cool.
That was it.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Yeah.
Really?
Well, I think this has been getting all the shapes
and opening day at school.
Oh, man.
We had got hundreds of computers and then,
which meant we actually had to move about 500.
So there were no printers.
One of our 100 printers worked or not.
100 standards worked.
Everybody wanted it, you know.
So...
But I think for KitchenAuth,
kind of mess and we found out we'll probably get
a thousand machines in our district.
Roughly.
And there are going to be huge ones, I guess,
when I be on Ransom.
It's been a whole weekend.
It's been a whole weekend.
It's been a whole weekend.
A $400 in the school history.
I like it.
I love it.
So hopefully I'll have some machines this year
for the E1-2 giveaway.
Okay.
But, you know, my name's storage space for that many machines.
And it's not the machines.
It's the monitors that are sold.
I'll rent those things.
Just to keep them from throwing them.
Yeah, you know.
So, you know...
Oh, the monitors, they can have them.
I guess I don't care that much about those.
I'm afraid they'll throw the boxes away.
If they sit anywhere for too long,
somebody will come by and say,
oh, they'll throw these away.
Don't do that.
They can't force.
No.
I think they'll keep trees.
Oh.
They'll be pretty decent machine.
You know, if you don't have one,
there's some sort of thing.
It'll open off the side.
I think they'll be pretty decent machine.
You know, if you don't have one,
there's some sort of thing.
It'll open off the side.
If you don't want to.
No, they'll be real.
I know I've already got kids coming up to me.
What are you going to do with that?
I think a lot of kids would like to have a computer
they just can't afford it.
That's interesting.
When we were at the software free and big,
and I know people were just doing that.
But I believe that some people,
they don't actually have computers.
Some people are probably not a computer.
They're not actually a computer.
Some people are just probably not a computer.
So, right.
So, there was actually quite a lot of people
in the same generation of computers.
Well, I think all those people need
or have a library.
They don't have a library.
They don't have a library.
Yeah.
Well, that's a good thing.
No, that makes good sense now.
Yeah.
Oh, it's cool.
It's cool.
It's cool.
It's cool.
Well, it's cool.
Where do we show you?
At a tech university.
Speed is probably there, too.
That's great.
Yeah.
No, that makes sense.
Yeah.
But I go to a library.
It's probably one of the best things.
Yeah.
You don't sit down and look at the internet.
Because there are a lot of people.
Yeah.
No, not the one.
You have to write.
Yeah.
You have to do it.
You have to do it.
Yeah.
But I was quite surprised, you know,
to a bunch of people simply say,
I'll be right back with you.
Yeah.
So, I've had quite a few kids going into my office,
but what you're going to do is,
so hopefully I'll get enough people,
I don't know, a thousand of students.
Well, if you need help, you know.
Just roll over.
Yeah.
Let's see more once we get more set,
and how many we're getting,
and where they're going.
They're going to do this.
Well, are they going to basically
all be the same type of machine?
From?
From?
That's pretty easy.
Just an image.
Yeah.
You can jump it on there.
Right.
From the work we were sitting in the city for eyes,
but then, you guys didn't say anything.
Yeah.
So, I think they just announced out.
Yeah.
I kind of felt too much to hear.
We get nearly as many as we wanted,
and then we were using the memory and stuff out of all of them
and the memory that all of them still have.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Floppies are full of gum and pees.
Stop!
Oh!
What?
They're kids using it.
It's like, you know,
fucking in an adventure or something.
Yeah.
The stuff gets destroyed.
They do.
They get you most very heavily at this.
Well, I suppose we used to have the whole city
around the dress that we were all over being driven.
Oh, yeah.
So, that would last like two minutes.
There wouldn't be any work you'd see
around dropping in the lamp.
Yeah.
When the lights have removable balls,
those are always there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
We figured out how I should give you a two-drop sign
or two for at the month.
Yeah.
You know, just for one day,
we would always, you could do the settings
where you could have the mouse wrap around,
and then you could set the sensitivity of the X and Y
coordinates.
So, we'd crank the sensitivity of the Y coordinate
and turn the X sensitivity all the way down
and then set it to scroll.
So, you'd move the mouse over like the entire way
for the pad and the cursor would move,
maybe like a 20-year-old cat with a scroll.
That's from the page, like about a thousand times.
Don't forget it burning the X and the Y.
Oh, yeah.
And then you'd burn the X and the Y,
but that's the other way.
There's no way anyone could use the mouse
to be able to see it.
Yeah.
We've seen a lot at the eyes.
Let me try every minute.
Do you work at a little closer distance?
Yeah.
Around the corner.
Oh.
Yeah.
So, there's two of us.
There's like 800 computers there.
Yeah, that's what you got.
Oh, guys.
Okay.
I've been just getting over the chase from the start.
I couldn't go and do one thing and come back
and then have five more things to do.
It was just a little...
And when people have problems with their computer,
they tend to take it all in effect,
and they're like, they don't even realize they're doing it.
That's the biggest frustration
for the people who couldn't even...
I do like it.
We're trying the best.
Right.
Yeah.
Because they couldn't even plug it in.
You know, we'd have a...
It'd take half a day to get a lab all set up
and then they'd come in and they go,
well, we moved our lab to the other side of the room,
but we didn't want to plug it in.
Well, none of the computers are working.
So, you know, my God, all the wiring you're going to be doing
on the boards.
But, you know, we'll have to see
this thousand machines is going to be on watch.
And we're all going to have to be going to the elementary schools.
I guess they're all probably getting upgraded labs.
So, they're not new machines.
Probably the D530s, the HPD530s and the 510s,
which is better than what we've got now.
So, you see how it goes?
Yeah, so...
Passing my fingers.
We got a new guy at work.
He's following around.
Yeah, tech sports, a thankfulest job.
They're not going to call you up and go,
boy, my computer's working for the last four days.
I really appreciate it.
And we have people bring me a lot of chocolates.
But, if it goes down, go over here, no!
Yeah.
So, how did it go?
Exactly.
Yeah, they had to learn patience.
Cool.
How old are you?
One thing that was kind of interesting,
it's like a single sign-on to work
and an active XP to log into an active directory,
and never log in, and automatically mom's a drive,
and from Fedora server,
that was sharing user records.
It depends on shared space in all three systems,
like one sign-on using a browser.
Like a strip set browser?
Well, it was kind of an issue.
There was a login script for XP.
That was assigned to your profile,
and a login script that was assigned to user,
and that way.
And then the window strip plot,
not the plot,
but the one strip,
and the one sign was shared.
Yeah.
It's waiting.
I got it.
Yeah.
It's not too difficult,
but it's different to work with all three systems at once,
and I can start that off here.
And then we had to figure out how to get that to work
across the browser,
doing that.
Yeah.
Sounds very technical to me.
Cool.
I mean, I do it all last week,
and I don't know.
What are we doing?
Stop the freedom date.
Well, thank you.
Well, I have a software already.
And what else?
I opened my first beer from Saturday,
and it was drinkable.
That is our sharing line.
Because it's 21.
You're still here, you have that.
They were saying,
you're here,
even though it might taste bad,
you could not not look really.
That's pretty.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's how it tastes.
You know, the line locker,
it might taste bad,
but it's really good.
That's how it feels.
It turns to be in this way.
Oh, like this.
I'll call Bill Bill Bill of the drinks.
But not you.
Not you, but not you.
But I see a drink enough of that.
Wow.
That would be really good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
And that would be really good.
That would be all about it.
I, you know,
I'm really hoping that home growing right now,
so I think it's just some of all the backburner.
No.
What?
I won't be doing the same.
When it's in the backburner.
It's much of an automated system,
the monitor, the process,
you know.
I guess I might be barbed rafts,
if I get some extra help.
Yeah.
That's really good.
That's really good.
I'm not doing barbed rafts right now.
Sure.
That's a pretty big operation.
Take up half the pulse.
No.
No.
Just a bathroom.
No.
It's, you know, you offer them a big five gallons.
Oh, okay.
Sure.
You can lift it up.
Yeah.
You can pull it.
Okay.
I tried once with one of those, like,
bags that you get the bag.
I don't know if it's just like 10 or 15 years ago.
Yeah.
And I tried to get it.
Don't do it Mr. Beer please.
Mr. Beer.
It was like everything.
The yeast bagging is up in this bagging add water.
Just put it in the corner for like a week or two.
And now I'll try to get it out.
No.
We are a college.
So, like, it's really good.
I don't even know.
Sure.
That's how they make sure.
I'm going to do a miss.
I'm going to put sugar in there.
Yeah.
Babies for rotten raisins and apples.
Oh, and so, yeah.
Yeah.
Jail whiskey.
No, that's what they were talking about.
They can't give bread out to the inmates in the jail because they'll try to make bread.
Yeah.
These are the bread and we can put their fruit in the bag and feed it.
Like, what in the world?
What do you have this for?
What?
You have all these?
You have all these, right?
Yes.
The yeast is actually a living creature.
Is it?
Well, you can actually put also the yeast on the air.
Really?
Yeah.
I was thinking something about it.
It actually makes the flour and it just lets it sit for a couple of days and then you put it in your fridge.
And then you can, you like, let it grow and add a little bit of sugar to it.
And so, you were filled with liquid oil.
And you were talking about it.
You know, it keeps it going.
It keeps it going.
It keeps it going.
The guy who pulled us interviewed even had a name for his tariff here.
Yeah.
He had a hard car already.
He had a name for our yeast.
And then they say it's actually, I'm thinking, different areas produce different, very different
tasting breads.
Because of the natural, formative yeast in the air.
And with different data, I'm going to use some yeast in there.
Oh, salt.
Salt.
Salt when I...
It's okay with PETA then.
It's neck beer.
It's okay with PETA even though you're killing millions of ants in yeast.
You're making them a better hook.
I made.
Yeah.
That's hell, alright.
I'mellenye.
Hmm?
Oh, really.
Thank you Kebra.
Okay.
You'll beispersed into a lot of milk.
spacey and doughy.
I'll tell you something.
Yeah.
I'll tell ya something.
Bloch, please.
I'll tell you something.
I'll tell you something.
Okay.
I don't need a tour.
Yeah, a wild use.
Good tour for free, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How about you, Willis?
I'm going to see you here for some time.
I've been out for a month.
I went on a vacation.
And I got dropped on the couple road.
I tried my best to get this and this and this.
I'm going to set my eyes on the drop drop.
And I'm going to keep my eyes on it.
But I'm going for weeks.
Oh, I keep it just.
I saw that it's time I picked up a program.
Probably got that.
I'm going to reverse it here.
Progressive rain in the generation.
Wow.
Progressive rain in the beginning.
Thanks.
How did you see this?
Where did we go on the vacation?
I was at the end of the program.
We didn't know what to do.
We didn't know what to do.
We didn't know what to do.
Isn't that the suppose thing?
We don't know.
Well, we don't know the projector.
But what we can do is,
we can go off to, uh,
we have two listeners right now.
Yeah, Rocket.
Definitely.
We don't know that.
Still two, right?
Where is your thing?
Bring it out.
I'm not even sure if I could.
So what you can do is you can go up.
There's an advocate.
The one who told you about the high limit when it's fixed is the equal one.
You go.
Where is it?
I go.
If you would leave
on the right or the one running.
If you would leave about five o'clock, that would be fantastic.
Because it's time, hours drive and the who would be there?
60M, that would be great.
And we are here today.
On a website, are you there is skeletal Chemistry.
So if you go there you can find out what is the credit card for this table.
Whoever is in the middle already have a speaker there.
If you go out and they can call...
Can I look up?
Can I have a screen?
You can call me.
You can call me.
Can I have a screen?
Can I have a screen?
Can I have a screen?
Can I have a screen?
Oh, look at the batteries.
You can't hold the questions.
But praise that, I swear to you, that accent's pretty good.
Ah.
I just want to give a wide answer.
It just made meование...
...because the user has it even more.
I think it makes sense.
That's right.
Umm.
The guy from Blackgrass is
joining us and his English Timber hits.
He was saying that...
People actually come back before here, so they put it that way of meeting, and from I said we could stay overnight in my house.
So right now we have four people, just anybody else might go.
How are y'all?
Away?
Yeah, well, we can't go up with four people here.
You've been picked already, so you don't have to.
It's just Saturday.
It's Friday and Sunday.
Well, you're coming back the same day.
You are on Sunday.
Oh.
I'll try to be there on Friday.
Then you have to go to bed on Sunday.
Just stay over one two nights.
Is this what it's an apartment?
Well, it's 12-hour drive.
I'm a three-way.
Then we will go up.
We will not go through Chicago.
It's just to make sure that we'll get there.
We will.
So that we have to go to Chicago.
Did I have the greatest Google map of that?
I do.
Well, I know we can get a little bit between that building,
but I have a little part of it.
It doesn't matter.
You just drive it all in the end and make sure you don't drive through it all the way back.
Yeah.
I know, yeah.
I've got to spin to get an Ohio one.
You won't get 500 yards fast there before the big deal.
Well, why don't you stop and you tell them you don't have a chance to know what you're going to do.
I don't want you to know.
Okay.
I know.
Because I asked somebody from Chicago.
It's like, if I went, you know, because Wisconsin, we don't have holes,
we just think, you know, you should be able to drive on the road.
But, you know, what do you do if you're on a change?
Well, let's just take your wife's plate number down,
and they keep track of it.
If you do, it's made time to serve you something.
They also, they often speak the same time,
and that's the hardest part of it.
I want you to talk about the other day.
It used to be 40 on every total.
Right now, each total is different.
And really, you don't know what it is sometimes you will think that you're a good guy.
So you, you have like the role of the body, you know, a change of shore.
You're going to change it today.
You're going to have a cool pilot in there.
And when you're driving on, you know, right now you're driving,
and there is maybe, you know, 500 yards so that there's a total,
and there's $1.25.
So what are you going to do?
So the role of $1.25, you know,
you're going to change it, you know,
washer, maybe, and panty.
And you're playing.
Oh, I'm good.
They may be in a total way of cost a lot of two.
That's one type of deal.
You get on, you get a ticket when you get off to pay,
and on the pack.
Oh, they change it now.
Yeah, I know.
Well, this is the model.
Oh, it's always been like that.
Really?
Yes.
Even 16 years ago?
Wow, six.
You know what time you got to take it.
Where you ended up?
That's an automatic ticket.
If you get there too early, really?
I bet you got a lease.
Oh, okay.
They all have a big rest here.
Yeah, they do.
Don't look here to take it.
Look at it.
You've got to go the full distance anyway.
Yeah, so we can just throw it out.
So we're going to go south from south.
No, we go, yes.
We go south from Madison, and then we go to Rockford.
Yeah.
You know, if you say where to go, if you put it in.
We just did that last week, did we?
I mean, yes.
We were showing that one.
We used to earn instantly.
You know, I'm very, I'm technical person.
So I cannot actually say where I go from.
Oh, okay.
A lot of women like them.
I'm not letting work as I don't know where they go.
Okay, you're worried about my GPS guide at Devil's Lane.
That's why a map is better.
That's where it's stuck.
It would not work after that GPS force at Devil's Lane.
But what I call a Devil's Lane.
It looks like it's a flat there.
So it's just spread out.
But it's one of the zero-seed above all.
There's the guy in the cabin.
He's got a program to give the bad performance.
Then there's anyone driving by.
Yes.
That's my family vacation.
The guy is going to see that sign over there.
You don't want to go that way.
You want to go that way?
So that was about a while.
Let me see.
Then we had another.
About Andrew.
Yeah.
So there was no bus yesterday.
Did somebody read it?
Yeah, I read it.
That's just one.
No, I had told you that.
No, I had told you that.
Right.
It's not the radio.
It's the 80s.
Oh, the 80s.
You got to get an adapter.
Actually, it's an inverter.
It doesn't scan for this button.
I pull it down here.
So far, they're saying it's not working.
It looks like this is not working.
It's not working.
It's turning off the adapter.
It's just a provider.
It's turning off.
What is Andrew?
What is Andrew?
It's a platform.
It's an operating system.
Oh, okay.
I tried to get it in general,
but I'm not happy with it.
Oh, yeah.
It's great.
It's great.
It's great.
It's great.
It's great.
Do you think it was the most convenient area
that you want to go around with the stop?
I think it was in the neighbourhood,
along with the neighbourhood.
That's why.
But I didn't realize the use of throughout theansaway.
Yeah, behind this doors.
It really manbrows before all people are doing it.
It stamps myself.
Nobody I would gamble at.
But it was not.
There's still a lot of stuff.
I just didn't know if they had a player that actually worked out there.
Is there a good one for Linux anywhere?
Is there any good flash player existence for Linux?
Well, you can call it a match or a little bit of a match.
It means it lasts a little bit longer.
This is going to scare you.
Has anybody else heard about this new click-jacking exploit that's just recently come out?
There's no patch for it currently, so they're trying to keep it under wraps.
What is it called?
It's called click-jacking.
Apparently, it looks like small nature browsers.
I think they said all nature operating systems doesn't involve JavaScript or Flash.
There's really not many all browsers are vulnerable to it besides native Linux.
I bet that the size of it is.
And of course, that's right.
Why are we not able to make it worse?
Anyway, so what is it called?
Apparently, they don't even really want you to know any specifics.
There was a conference about it that really, I guess a lot of people couldn't get in with them.
A lot of specific people there.
But it allows an attacker to, like, you can do it in JavaScript.
You'll need it, but like, using JavaScript, you could have decided on it.
You may have paid it for a MySpace page, anything that depends on your concept.
It allows the attacker to click on anything on that page without you knowing about it.
And apparently, for each click that the user makes, it allows the attacker one click to do anything.
I think it has to be on that page.
They don't really explain it very well.
But that's crazy.
Each of them plugged into the kit and put in the positive.
What do you talk about?
What do you talk about?
It's about key commerce.
Actually, we started to have more thought recently.
And what it is that somebody had stolen pretty cards and addresses all these information,
even on the back of Chris.
Oh, yeah.
And how we find out is how we found out is that it was not placed from the back.
It was not placed from IP address from EUN States.
It was placed, let's say, from South Africa, outside of this place.
Olding spreadsheets, which we don't do a bunch of business here.
Okay.
So...
You see that?
I don't know.
This is just a discount.
That was the only way you could recognize what...
Did you have to...
How did you get the calling IPs of those?
If somebody knew a request on your page.
Okay, so that's what you actually logged the IPs of EUN.
That's a good idea.
I never thought it would.
Apache does a lot of metal things, do they?
Wait, this will get in Apache's logic.
This one is on Apache's logic.
Whatever web block.
So, how's it going?
No, absolutely.
It's just a good question.
Nothing is absolutely right now.
It's also wrong if you don't want to point it out.
Do you guys do a lot of e-commerce?
We do e-commerce.
How much has a percent of fraud would you say?
I don't know.
But they were saying that it's the very second.
Yes.
It's a great panelist.
Three or four of these are some people in the past.
Three or four of these are some of these.
I think they were saying...
I don't know.
I don't know.
But it's a problem, obviously.
That doesn't stop politicians going ahead.
Right.
Who needs facts?
They just confused the situation.
I think we could be one of those which they actually received.
$7.8, $7.8.
Yeah.
Well, you know, if you don't give them that my head's going to be recession,
I thought that's why we got those stimulus checks.
It's a great head recession.
You don't have $700 billion divided by $299.
I agree.
I don't really feel the United States to me.
Yeah.
$180.
$230.
$2500 each.
$2500?
That's only that, yeah.
Yeah, but this.
The only all-by note is that we cannot have a health insurance
where everybody here could drop out of money.
Yeah.
We can bail out every major company.
Well, $700 billion.
$700 billion.
Well, no.
It has to be a lot of clearly capable.
No, it appears.
He's not even elected.
He's not even elected.
They want to give it to the private sector, individual,
or even give it to whoever he chooses to know for whatever reason.
By any stock, at any price he wants.
You know, so my friend has a stock.
I'll buy all this stock at five times.
Sounds like good corruption is brewing.
Yeah.
That's a brewing.
That's a brewing.
That's a good one.
That's a good one.
Good one.
Over there.
Over there.
Up to the seat.
That's the peak.
SGI released OpenGLs.
And they are sending huge gift free送 goods to the community.
No, yeah.
Good, yeah.
I got a good article.
I just got an impression.
It's really frustrating.
Oh, it stayed depressing.
Yeah, it's not so depressing.
Yeah.
It's a double bolt racing.
Yeah, it's a double bolt racing.
Yeah, it's a double bolt racing.
Yeah, it's a double bolt racing.
Yeah, it's a double bolt racing.
Yeah, it's a double bolt racing.
They're basically setting up for the double bolt.
If we come up with this one, it's more or less...
Progress with this one.
And you can actually drive it all the way down.
So they can re-write the previous one.
It's like, I don't know what the bottom is.
I don't know how much of this is driven by Microsoft.
Microsoft is a member of OpenGL community.
It seems kind of...
You know, a little shady thing is they're the direct competitor for it.
They're the sole competitor.
They're the sole competitor.
They're the sole competitor.
But could they be delaying stuff behind the scenes?
OpenGL isn't...
The committee doesn't really say all that much on the fact that, you know,
we all know they're farthest from us.
It's kind of forever since 2.0 came up here.
The problem with OpenGL is that it started to pass off.
I mean, it started to pass off.
But then when they made it to the main part,
it wasn't Microsoft and there was every major test video
or a remaker, you can see how many times they got decent.
And then everybody just bought heads and nothing to read.
And they didn't know that those are OpenGL now.
They've got a few things that they've never seen.
Like, half the cash almost regressed.
But they're still buying heads.
OpenGL 3 was supposed to be...
Yes.
But they have to open their 2.0.
The same thing.
It's just a few...
A few hundred percent of the cash you can't find in the market.
And a few.
And another thing.
And then the article was that OpenGL
and OpenGL 3 is over.
OpenGL 3 has been the single OpenGL is made in mind.
OpenGL 2!
And then we've got lots of that stuff.
And that we got lots of this stuff, a lot of stuff with Joey's stuff later.
So there was article about Picasso 3.
Then I tried Picasso 3.
It's a window that we wanted to line, but really well.
Picasso 2 ran, he spent a lot of money on it.
