Hello HPR community.
This is K Wischer from the Linux Logcast Online Log Community.
We've decided to provide an HPR episode of our outtakes from our published content.
It is, we start recording when we all get together on mumbles, so we have a preshow banter
and also some after-show banter.
So what I'm doing here is taking the outtakes that we normally don't publish and combine them
into an episode for your listening pleasure.
I'll insert our normal intro music and outro music in between the two sections so to
know when each one starts and stops.
Thank you for listening and here we go.
Okay, let's start chatting away.
I mean we can always cut out edit out this, but it's good to capture the general chit chat.
We could cut this off and put it at the end like Telts does as a preshow chatter.
Yeah, bonus segment.
Dude, man, you're not going to talk, you got that great microphone.
I do want to interrupt you guys, you know, I don't really know who I was going on, so I didn't want to disturb you.
Here's kind of the general format we discussed.
We're going to have like some dedicated, at least one dedicated topic at the start of the show
that one of the hosts is going to bring and discuss.
And then we're going to open up the show for discussion about that topic and any emails which we don't have yet
from listener feedback and invite people that want to chat with us about problems they may be having
and maybe we can offer a solution.
And it's just going to be kind of an open discussion afterwards like a roundtable discussion
after the general topic and general discussion about that topic.
If there's any questions amongst, you know, anybody about the topic.
So that's kind of the way that we're kind of in this old format of the show is going to go.
Right, and this being our first one, the only thing we came up with was that we didn't expect to,
heck, I probably personally didn't expect to see this many people in the room, which is awesome.
Thank you for showing up.
But this first one, we just kind of all feared we'd try to bring something just to try to fill in the space.
Well, question, are we going to wait for 5150 to join us?
I saw he disconnected from my RC couple minutes ago.
So he's coming.
Okay, then Kev and everyone, I'll leave my mic unmuted.
So I'll try and join in a little bit.
If nothing more, you can just at the beginning say hi.
And then later on, if you have any questions about anything that was talked about or what somebody said,
you can just kind of chime right in.
Okie dokie.
So I think we ought to start out by just kind of, you know, in the official recording.
Whenever we get started here, it's kind of give the 300-furt view of what we're about.
You know, how the show's going to go.
What the community's about.
Just kind of give a brief overview of what we're trying to do.
And who's do we want to do?
Well, I guess we have to wait on 50.
Let's see if he wants to talk about that free node topic he has in the show notes.
Are there show notes somewhere I can have a look at?
I just pasted them in the RSC.
Thanks.
5150 must have a big list of stuff.
If it's anything like kernel panic.
Debarry Alt, you most likely have an RSC client.
If you're running Linux, you probably got an XChat or even Pigeon can be used for RSC.
Or one of the terminal-based clients.
Take a tankinator mentioned also.
RSC, or WeChat, or I can't remember all of them.
Now the fellow Arch user.
I'm using Manjuro, so it's Arch-based.
This isn't an Arch podcast, is it?
No.
Shame.
Take a tankinator.
If you look at our website, there's on the how-to page.
There's a PDF file you can download to get an easy quick setup.
Sorry for being late.
I was talking to tank in the IRC.
I'm going to blame him.
Hey, 50, how you doing?
Oh, I can't complain too much.
Nice to hear.
Stream is live.
If everybody knows that too.
We got a live stream.
There's a link on the website.
Tony was kind enough to give us a subdomain for a URL forwarder to my PC.
Yeah, with me setting up the hosting, it's pretty easy to a DNS setup.
Align it in to make it a subdomain.
And it's the same thing that we use.
It's SMLR, so it's nice.
I want to thank Kevin there for letting us use your PC.
No problem.
I mean, it's a Raspberry Pi.
It just sets there and hums long sucking up very little energy.
And it does its purpose.
Well, Hunky, or 50, do you want to bring your topic of the free node into the show?
Yeah, that's fine with me.
I thought probably be more appropriate to first talk about what the show was going to be about.
But when we get done with that, yeah, I'm ready to give that presentation.
So we all in agreement, we want to do these three topics.
Mine, Hunky's, and 50's for tonight.
Or do we want to just limit to one?
Or do we all do the two short ones, say 50's for the next episode?
So we don't run out of content.
Well, mine's pretty short.
It shouldn't take long at all.
Mine just basically like a couple of steps.
And the GUI, and then two steps in the command line.
And that's pretty much it.
Mine's probably 10, 10, 15 minutes tops discussion without any questions or anything.
Well, I mean, I think we should start with who we are.
What we're aiming at that is going to be a live stream.
And we're going to start with at least one presentation from one of the hosts.
And then go in to accepting or try to answer questions that have either come in the previous week through email
or through people in the IRC who are listening to the stream.
Or for people who are actually in the mumble chat with us.
And we mentioned the mumble chat.
I think we should say right off.
I don't think it's set up yet, but the idea we had that the, you know,
we're actually looking for, you know, a regular cadre of people to, you know, come in each week.
But we've decided to limit the total number.
And that probably the four original host always, you know, always have a slot.
And then after that, you know, it'll be up to 10 or 15, whatever, whatever we think is manageable.
Is that a plan, guys?
Wait, you're going to mention how many people might be in the room at the same time.
I think that might be just getting a little too detailed.
I think maybe, you know, 10 or 30 seconds, like this is Linux user group logcast.
We talk about issues that people might be having.
People might have solved. People might not been unable to solve.
And have a guest or two sometimes.
And generally talk about what we've been up to and how we're working with Linux.
Period.
I think we ought to talk about how to contact the show with questions, you know, the email address that we have for the show.
And then that, you know, we'll take, you know, if we don't have anything, if we don't have anything, came up before the show to deal with.
We'll take questions from the IRC of people who are listening to the feed.
And we'll also take questions from people are in the channel.
And that was something you guys brought up that we might need.
At some point, we might want to consider limiting the number of people actually in the mumble channel.
If you don't want to talk about that right away, you know, you know, we always leave that and say, hey, we've decided at this point that, you know, maybe we need that limits or, you know, maybe writing it.
Because I think that's kind of off putting myself.
So maybe we could wait and see, you know, if it comes to zoo or something like that, like some people complaining about the old Linux basics, you know, not even, not even mention having a limit on the mumble channel at this point.
I agree until it becomes a problem when we don't want to limit limit anything.
Okay, it's great that but I, you know, I do think we need to run, run down that.
Hey, if you have a question, you could, you can submit it to, what is it? Feedback at LinuxLudcast.org.
Com is it, okay. And, you know, we'll, we'll try to have an answer for you. If you do it that way, we'll try to have an answer for you before the show.
Or you can, you can listen to the live stream and, you know, interact with us at hash LinuxLudcast.
And we'll try to answer your questions that way. Or if you like, you know, we'll post the mumble particulars and you could come on join us on the show.
But I think, I think we should make, make clear, you know, the four of us are not expecting to be, oh, we're, we're the host and that's, that's going to be it.
You know, we're, you know, we're, we're trying to get, we're just the start of this thing and, and we're trying to gather participation from the community.
I agree. Yeah, I agree, too. I think it's a nice humble way to go about it and you're not trying to be like a dictator or something.
It, uh, it fosters more communication and in collaboration.
We have our first question through feedback dot from the feedback email from Dudeman himself.
I was wondering who was watching that and how could it be? That was about 25 seconds.
Fast on the trigger. I meant for you to reply very good.
We're replying live. I don't know what better could you get? That's amazing. Really truly amazing.
We're here to serve the community. My life is to serve.
Well, who wants to give, like, start to show off and give, like, the 300 foot view of what we're doing here and then we'll get going. It's 921 now.
Yeah, I've got to save my dad from the cat. So if somebody else wants to do that real quick, I'll be right back.
Honky. Yes. All right. So am I kicking this off? Find by me.
So were we going? Are you guys just waiting for me?
Give me two minutes to figure out how I want to start this off then unless somebody else just wants to jump right in and kick it off.
Well, I kind of covered it. Let me give it an attempt. And if anybody says, no, that's not what we mean to do.
Then, you know, we could somebody else can redo it.
Tag your it.
And I help I was not to an end of that podcast for everybody.
Yeah, no problem. You know, I've got a suggestion that maybe in the future, one of the future when presentation idea is to talk about,
sorry about that, to talk about what you guys are using for your show notes.
I think it's pretty cool. You can have multiple people editing, but at the same time.
That's that's ether pad light is the name of that.
Oh, is it light? I thought you had the full on ether pad.
Now, it's actually a turnkey VM that you can download from turnkey dot Linux.
And it's actually running on a virtual box VM.
Okay, now is the one you had for 24 hour show.
Was it full ether pad? Cause it looked like it had more bells and whistles.
Well, that was a K5 Tux who provided that one.
Oh, that's right.
And I believe it was. I believe it. If I'm not mistaken, I feel to speak up and join us.
I think it is the full ether pad version from not mistaken.
I think he's muted both his mic and his headphones. He probably can't hear you right now.
Okay, yeah, cause I I used to say saying at home on my local server ether pad light, it's incredible.
Chatter, I won't need anybody to upload any audio to me unless I find out that mine is bad and I need the backup.
So we'll just save that until I let you know it's published.
It's ready to be published.
Thank you. Because with my upload speeds, I think you might have to wait a while.
Well, even, you know, in our emergency, you could you could convert to all good and that would work out fine.
I did my recording and I came out to 24 bags, you know, so it's much smaller than the 2.5 gig file.
Yeah, well minor wave files that's probably why they're so huge.
Yeah, yeah, agreeing. Yeah, wave does take up a lot of space.
And what I've noticed is that for voice like this, the compression doesn't make that much of a difference.
It's if you're doing more with recording music, that's where you don't want the compression.
But for just voice chats and for even, you know, reading books and stuff, that's where it really doesn't make that much of a difference with the compression of AUG.
Good point.
Be right back.
Dee Berryall, you've welcomed an unmute and join us if you want to give you, if you want to help.
You need any help with your audio.
Down here, you've seen your lips light up, nothing.
Do you have, what distribution are you using? Arch is it correct?
Do you have pulse audio installed with the pulse audio volume control?
You usually can go into pulse audio volume control and select the, make sure you get to correct the input there.
For instance, on mine, I'm using a USB headset mic combo.
If you go to input devices, make sure you've got your mic device selected there.
Can you hear me now?
There you are.
I don't feel too bad a couple of weeks ago.
I missed a show because I didn't realize or did remember, I didn't plug the USB mic and was trying to get it connected.
Couldn't figure out why it wasn't present.
Fifty-year audio did excellent tonight.
Thanks.
Not one stutter, except from you personally.
But it seems your bandwidth was good tonight.
Well, that's always good to hear.
Usually I can blame my bad performance on the bandwidth.
I think we need to have Dudeman do us some voiceovers.
He's got that booming voice with the good, high-oh microphone there.
Welcome to the BSD unlock.
And he's got that sexy accent.
Well, only if we can get him his wife to accompany with the singing.
Yeah, she's awake.
She's awake on her computer.
We do need some mantra and outro, don't tune.
You serious?
I don't know.
We haven't really voted on whether we're going to do anything like, you know, intro, lead in and lead out.
You know, some short, ten-second lead in and lead out.
One, two, three.
Yeah, slip the word Linux in there and we got a theme song.
Yeah, it's wonderful as always.
Maybe not so appropriate for the show, but just a push is awake at 3 in the morning.
Yeah, we'll have to find out if the song is creative.
Yeah, it's an old folk song, so no problem there.
Hey, 5150, have you spoken recently at all to buy a brown?
Is he still around?
Well, he post quite regularly on G+.
He's doing that.
What's the sci-fi thing?
Scanner drone.
Scanner drone.
Yeah.
So I see him every couple of days with the post on that.
Is he recording anything or is that the podcast, the drone thing?
He does one of those once in a while, like an interview or something.
And he did originally about six months ago try to start like a, you know,
a, a, a lug up there in Pennsylvania online and I think it went about two episodes
and that was as far as it got.
I thought I missed it.
I thought he was actually trying to do a physical lug, but then this thing he was trying
to do on the mumble was like something separate.
I may be mistaken, but I thought he was, he was actually trying to start a physical lug in his area.
No, it wasn't a physical lug.
It was a more of a conference down in the Pittsburgh area.
I may need somebody's, Tony, I may need your help in getting reacquainted with archive.
I got the account set up and I did back about a year or a little over a year ago
when we did the Linux basics reboot thing.
I did upload and get the RSS feed for the, that it produces, but it's been a while.
So I can't remember the, I know it's kind of cumbersome to do that, isn't it?
If I remember correctly.
We're using just it as a file host and all the RSS feeding and everything is off of WordPress.
We use a plugin for WordPress called the Blueberry Powerpress and it goes through and generates the feeds
and it puts a little player right under each show notes page and everything.
So you don't, I think the way we were doing it for the Linux basics thing,
we actually had the use in Dudeman probably can remember better than I can because he helped me once.
It actually generated an RSS feed, RSS feed length.
I think Kevin that you were basically doing the same, I think you had the Blueberry plugin as well.
But you just have to upload the file yourself to archive.org, which I remember every time I did it,
I forgot where you've got a click, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to be honest.
You've got to get the hang of it again.
I'm guessing Tony, it's not automated in any ways.
You'd be uploading the files to archive, you don't have any command line method of doing it.
No, I do have the web interface and not automated, but they have added a few features in the last six months that's made it really easy.
And you can put in, I usually put it instead of putting all the show notes into the archive.org,
I put a link to our website with the show where the show notes are.
Yeah, that's definitely easier to maintain, I guess.
I recall a couple of years ago when we were all at all the HPRs up on archive.org, we were using FTP.
Yeah, I think you can use FTP if you don't want to use their web interface.
So if it's just a matter of getting the show there, getting the file there,
then I've installed the blueberry thing on our WordPress site.
What link do you put into there?
You have to get the link from the archive or site, correct?
Yeah, I think what you do is you go through and you upload the file,
and then it goes through and creates a page where archive.org also gives you a player
and we have an MP3 and an org file.
So when I upload two files every single time,
and they are associated with the same show,
so what you do is once it's there and you see the link where you can click to download it,
I right click on that and say, get the source, I can't think what it's called right now.
Copy link, location or something?
Yeah, that's it.
And then you paste that right into the, on the show notes of your WordPress page,
below the body of the post is where the power press line is,
and you paste it in right there, and then you could go.
And we run, because we run two different audio, the MP3 and the org,
then we use channels, I think.
I think we've decided to do MP3 and org, is that everybody's feelings?
Yeah, if we're going to do both, that's fine.
Yeah, I think my feeling was just try to leave anybody out.
I agree, that's why we went with both.
So the Windows people can play it straight from their Internet Explorer or iTunes,
and then everybody else in the world can play org.
Now, do you guys do an iTunes feed, broadcast feed?
It's not a full feed for iTunes.
It's our MP3 feed, it has the iTunes tags in it,
and then you have to have, you have to install iTunes on a computer,
and then you go in and you request or set up.
Now it's been two years since I've done this one, trying to remember.
But you do some kind of request through iTunes.com,
and to get the feed set up, and then anybody can find it in their iTunes.
Yeah, I kind of read, briefly read the process, and look convoluted to me.
But I think the pod press will do a lot of that for you,
actually put the information in the iTunes section, is that correct?
It'll go through format to feed, so iTunes can read it.
But to actually get you published on iTunes,
so people using iTunes can find it through their search.
You have to go through their website, and you have to have iTunes installed on a computer.
Boo.
I agree, so I had to take my Windows VM and install it, get it set up,
and then that was all I did with the VM.
Why do you need to have iTunes installed?
Do you use that to upload it or create something with it?
It's to get it registered with the iTunes service, basically.
Yeah, you have to have a username that iTunes will associate with your feed.
But then in the setup, you just point it to your website feed that is the MP3 feed,
and then it'll take it from there.
And then, honestly, I set it up, and I forgot about it.
I haven't touched it since.
So, one of us needs to set up a iTunes account,
or could I just like use my wife's account and set it up and create it,
and it'll be on an ether name, but I don't think it out of matter what.
I don't think it makes a difference.
I use the separate one, just because I don't really like that.
But it's up to you guys.
I mean, I personally would, like I did, I would use a separate account.
But you don't have to have a credit card or anything associated with it,
as far as I remember.
Yeah, you can do a free iTunes account.
Yeah, so we have two channels set up.
We have one that is the MP3 feed that also does that formatting for iTunes.
Then the second one is the org, and it's called channels in the WordPress plugin.
Because there's another way to do it, we can do multiple shows,
and there's multiple channels.
We want to choose channels.
The other thing with the plugin that we're using is,
we're using the HTML5 player instead of the flash player,
just because, you know, with Linux and Flash,
it's starting to phase out, and then also with some of the other devices.
We did that.
It also loads faster, your web page will load faster with the HTML5 player.
One more thing that we did is we have the feed on our website.
That's in order to U.S.
And that's what the main, you know, anything that I do edits on the show
and posting shows, is comes from that feed.
But what we have published for people to use,
and grab is our, is that Google, what's it called?
Feedburner, feedburner.
So the traffic for pulling the feeds comes from feedburner.
Now what's good about that is if you have a blip in your website,
feedburner will continue to be running where the website,
if it goes down for an hour or something,
if anybody tries to get to it at that point, then it won't go.
But if you're using feedburner, then it always is running.
People will always be able to get to it.
So the combination of using the feedburner,
plus the archive.org for your file posting,
that people will always be able to get to your shows,
even if something were to happen to their website for a period of time.
So Tony, to do that, did you have to learn RSS,
or were you able to just pretty much copy over that,
with that blue, whatever plug in,
and copy the contents of that over the feedburner and make it work?
Feedburner just points to RSS feed.
So the blueberry press sets up the two channels as two separate RSS feeds.
And I went over to the feedburner and told it to reference RSS feed.
Now it will reference it and it keeps a cashed file of R feed.
And then from there, people will grab that cash file.
So your traffic for a feedburner is all going through the Google servers
instead of pulling it off of the website or my server,
which in the long one would probably help me out if you guys could do that,
so that I'm not keeping my bandwidth down.
But then, like I said, it's for redundancy and for other reasons.
It's a good thing to do.
But as for your question about knowing how to format RSS,
I have no clue.
I didn't learn any of that because this plug in does it all for you.
And I've actually been having an issue and if you guys figured out,
let me know where our org file or our org feed shows up as a video feed
instead of as a audio feed.
And I can't figure out any settings or what is causing that.
So if you guys figured out, let me know.
Well, I'm glad you explained that feedburner to me because sometimes this weekend
I've already set up an archive.org page.
I have a copy stuff over.
At least the dev randoms that I've been editing the last six months.
I've been sticking them up on my drop box.
But I'm going to copy them over to archive and set up another
Drupal Gardens page, which will and plug links in that automatically create an RSS feed for me.
And so thanks for that tip.
I'll point feedburner at RSS feed and we should be good to go.
Yeah, that's great.
And even feedburner is even better if you're running your own server at home
and trying to host your web page off of it.
If you have a blip like you have to reboot your router or things like that,
then like said, feedburner is always running.
And it's also faster access for the feeds also because it's on the Google service.
Tony, when I paste your all feed RSS into, I'm just doing it in rhythm box for a quick test.
It doesn't even recognize it as an audio feed.
It won't let me subscribe to it.
No, no, I'm sorry.
I just never mind.
Okay.
And I think that's part of we have to other people say,
Hey, it's coming up as a video feed, not an audio feed.
And I don't know what's really causing that.
I've been going up and down that our power press plug in.
And I can't find anything in there.
It's saying run it one way or the other.
We have always just posted audio files to it.
It's just it's odd.
The only thing I think of is that maybe power press thinks,
because you can also have a odd video file.
Maybe it's getting confused.
I really don't know.
Tony, in the actual file that I just downloaded with WGET,
if you look in the media colon content tag,
there's a type equals quote, video slash,
augh, close quote.
So maybe that's it.
I don't know how that type portion gets put into the file,
but that's what it,
that's what it shows when I just look at the text
of the file I downloaded.
Yeah, yeah, and I've seen that.
But like I said,
it's the power press plug and creates all that RSS stuff.
Oh, maybe I have to go into the PHP files
and see where it's showing that,
and maybe just manually force it to the audio.
I'm not sure.
I would think that there's like a click to say,
switch it from one or the other or turn off,
other detect.
But just for your information,
that's the, that's the feed that I use in G Potter.
And whenever G Potter shows a new episode,
coming from SMLR,
it's always showing as an audio file,
not as a video file.
Yeah, yeah, I use G Potter also,
and I've noticed the same thing.
But if you, I'm running the newest version of G Potter right now,
and if you were to delete our feed
and then re-subscribe to it,
it puts it down in the video file section,
like it splits at audio and video files,
then you have to go into G Potter and right-click and, you know,
in the settings and tell it that this is an audio,
not a video files.
I mean, it still plays it as an audio,
but it, you know,
it thinks it's a video feed still.
Yeah, I'm on G Potter 2.20 dot something.
I tried to migrate to,
I think it's 3.5.2,
and I had some Python problems,
so I'm sticking with 2.20.
It's probably a good thing.
When I switched over,
I blew away all my subscriptions,
and the only way to get it back
was I had to uninstall the 3,
reinstall the 2 version,
export the OML file,
and then uninstall them,
and reinstall the new version,
and then re-import that file.
Are you on Debian,
or are some of their disc group?
You're not using Ubuntu,
but it's just my podcast player at work.
Because I know in the Debian.Deb file,
there's a script called Migrate2Trace.
That's the number 2,
and then TRES,
and that script needs to be run
before you start up G Potter 3,
that will migrate
all your G Potter 2 subscriptions
and downloads to whatever versions 3,
something uses for their format.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
I mean, I did the switch about a year ago,
but yeah, that would have been nice to know at that point.
But I think they switched from like a flat file format
to a database format
for keeping all the data running.
Yes.
That's why the big difference was.
I was also having trouble
with G Potter 3,
because G Potter 2 was GTK 2,
and G Potter 3 is GTK 3,
and I ran into problems
with G Potter 3,
and with Liferia,
the RSS feed reader that I use,
the version of Liferia 1.8.5,
I think, uses GTK 2 and 1.10.3,
which is what's available in Debian Testing.
1.10 uses GTK 3,
and I was getting unwanted behavior
in certain mouse activity
with the GTK 3 applications,
both G Potter and Liferia,
or Liferia,
and I'm not sure how to pronounce it.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know, I left the distro pretty much handle that stuff for me,
and I'm not a, you know,
I don't get that deep into that stuff.
Although, I mean,
for my main rotations,
I've gone away from Ubuntu
because I don't like Unity.
I'm using Mint with the Cinnamon Desktop,
and I love it.
Well, let me throw the question out,
then.
Is there anybody
that's using GTK 3 applications,
currently using the applications
on a regular basis?
I guess that's a no then.
I honestly don't know the difference
between the GTK 2 and GTK 3
to really say whether I'm using one or the other.
Yeah, I wouldn't be able to tell you
without doing some research.
Yeah, you don't have to be running Noam Shabler
on the GTK 3 applications, do you?
Yeah.
Yeah, see, I am not one of those people
who ever said,
okay, I'm going to install
either GTK or I'm going to install cute,
and then I'm going to be very careful
and not cross over the applications
because I don't want to make my system bigger
by pulling in all those libraries.
One thing I'm not good enough to know
what I was doing on that.
But I use it for a lighter desktop
than either one.
Yeah, I see what you're saying with lighter desktops.
But I find, you know, most of my machines
are dual core or better.
So I honestly,
I like the, I can't be of the,
you know, Noam Shabler with Cinnamon,
you know, some of that graphic or the animation.
I think from,
if I remember correctly
that I'm on using XFCE
and they're not implementing GTK3
until the next major release
if I remember correctly.
I can't remember what podcast I heard talking about
in depth on XFCE.
Yeah, see, that was something came up
during the after show on HPR,
one of the,
somebody's going off well,
he liked XFCE,
but they had,
oh, they were never going to go GT,
they decided never to go GTK3.
So they would go,
you know, they were,
they were always going to be marginalized.
And I brought that up on another show.
It says, no,
whoever said that is behind the times.
They are definitely incorporating GTK3 libraries.
I just did a quick search through my graphical package manager
on my intro for GTK
and mostly apps were showing two-point something or another.
Well, let me ask you then, Kevin.
When you have a GTK2 application open
and the content inside the window
is,
the content is larger than what can be displayed in the window.
So you need to scroll down.
You have a sliding scroll bar trough at one side.
Is that correct?
I hope that's clear.
Say that again,
because you said a GTK3 app.
Is that correct?
No, I'm sorry.
I meant a GTK2 app.
Let's say you open up a GTK2 app
and it can be any kind of GTK2 application.
If the,
if what's being displayed within the applications window,
is larger than what can be displayed in just the window.
So you need to scroll down or page down.
You have a sliding scroll bar on one side of the application.
Is that correct?
Yes, well, for instance,
I use Hexchat and for IRC
and there are sliding bars both vertically
and horizontally for content that over fills the three panels.
Good, so that's a good example.
When you move your mouse cursor into that scroll bar
and you do one mouse click,
one left button mouse click,
does the content of what's in the display move up by one page
or does it hop to the spot in the scroll bar
to off that you've clicked on?
It moves to where my mouse clicks on.
Is there a way that you know of to make it move up
or move down by one page at a time per mouse click?
No, I do not know that.
Okay, because the one page per mouse click
is what I've become accustomed to
and how the GTK2 applications that I run behave
and the GTK3 applications did not have that behavior.
Instead, what's displayed within the window
is a hopped or skipped to the spot
in the scroll bar where I mouse clicked
and I wanted it to do it one page at a time instead.
So that's the GTK setting and GTK3
and it's not a mouse setting?
If it is, I don't know how to change it
to make it behave the way that I wanted to.
I've asked a couple of places
and I've not gotten any helpful suggestions yet.
Now, when I right click in that trough
the scroll bar trough,
it goes up one page at a time.
Ah, that's interesting. I hadn't tried that.
In your Hexchat window,
do you have tabs open up
like your Firefox tabs but within Hexchat,
you have tabs displaying along the top
or along the side of the application?
No, I don't have tabs.
Okay, because that's another behavior
that changed between GTK2 and GTK3 here
with the GTK2 tabs
if I move the mouse cursor up to the tabs,
I could use my scroll button scroll wheel
on my mouse to move along the tabs
and with GTK3,
the scroll mouse button didn't do anything with those tabs.
And likewise, I've asked about that problem
in a couple of places
and not gotten anything helpful and reply.
50 to you on that host that guest
you're having tomorrow night.
That school system,
is that, I think,
if I tried to, after you mentioned it,
and he was, I think, a senior,
G++, he was going to be on
I was trying to find some articles
to read about that a little bit more
and is it correct that 1700
is just the high school class
that's getting those laptops?
Hello?
Hey, Kevin.
Did you hear my question?
I'm sorry, I was out for a minute.
Oh, on that, the guest you're having tomorrow night
that's doing the Linux laptops.
Did I read correct that 1700 students
is just the high school students?
Oh, I thought that was the entire district.
It could be maybe just the high school students.
If that's the entire district,
that's pretty small,
small district.
Uh, the district I work for,
they have about 10 kids in a class.
So seven?
So it's one school corporation
or is it, like, a whole county or...
Well, it's a Penn Manor district.
I don't think that covers the entire county.
It's like Millersville or something.
Because I looked it up,
I want to see how close we were going to be
when we're going to be at OCP Live.
Come May.
We average about 100 per class.
So that's, you know, K through 12.
That's roughly 1300 students
in our corporation.
Well, that's what my high school
that I went to is,
is about 100 per class.
The one that I've been doing work for over the years,
20 is a huge class.
10 is about average.
And they lost their high school
a few years ago.
Well, a lot of people think it was silly,
but, you know, the Greensburg tornado.
It was, there was these three schools
that sort of had agreements and stuff.
You know, Greensburg was in the center.
And then to the West,
you had Moanville
and to the East shed,
Haveland, which is the one I worked for.
And Haveland was probably nearly as big as Greensburg.
And so when they,
when the high school,
well, when all the schools got wiped out at Greensburg,
Moanville and Haveland would have been
easily big enough to pick up the slack
for a year or so until they got a new school bill
at Greensburg,
but instead Greensburg,
you know,
spent all their insurance money
on setting up schools in like trailers
over there.
And then, sorry,
to catch playing with my headphone cord.
You know,
then tried to get government money and grant money
to rebuild their new school.
And to get the school big enough,
they said, you know,
oh, we'll close the school to the West
and we'll take all the high school students
from the school to the East.
And of course,
the real estate taxes went up ridiculously
in the whole county
because of all that.
But so the school,
I had, you know,
the school,
I do stuff for now.
They lost all the high school.
And so they've only got the grade school
and the middle school now.
And I think handwriting's on the wall.
Eventually, they consolidate the whole thing,
which gives, you know,
which gives some of the,
some of the kids from the school
I work for like an hour's ride on the bus every day
if they had to do that.
Did any of that come through, Kevin?
Oh, yeah, yes.
I was,
when I was just curious about that situation
in Pennsylvania, actually,
if that was like one school corporation
or actually, you know,
what grade levels that was.
Well, I think you're right.
I think it is higher grade levels.
And I'm surprised, though,
I guess at that level,
it does make a difference.
I mean, one of the things they cited was the,
the cost of the software contracts.
You know, where I work,
it's, you know,
when there's maybe 200 seats,
a total,
I think it's less than that now,
the high school's gone.
But, you know,
when they can,
when they can get office for $50,
so I think it's more than that now.
For years,
they were able to buy office pro for $50, 60 bucks
on, you know,
on the academic plan.
You know,
I just couldn't sell open source to them.
You know, they weren't the,
you know,
a few of the computers like it in the library.
It's like,
well, we don't need,
you know,
they're not going to be doing their assignments there.
They, you know,
I'll throw open office on them.
And then I got nothing but complaints.
And then, you know,
they didn't know they could save it in a compatible format.
I'd say everything up to,
to save by office by default.
But, you know,
after six months,
no, this thing is not,
it's not what we're using their place else,
just by six copies of office pro
and throw it on there.
I'll be back in just a minute.
Kevin, I put three links in the mumble chat
about the project.
And, you know,
I guess the rollout.
Thank you.
But, you know, Chad,
you know, even all his experience in open source
as far as he was ever to get able to go
when he worked through K through 12
was to install open source applications on top of windows.
You know, he never got to this point where he could actually,
you know,
do an open source operating system.
Yeah, I know.
It's a crying shame,
the money that Apple and Microsoft
make off of school systems.
Well, that's what I was going to bring up.
I mean, when I was brought up
and see the first couple of years I worked for the school,
I just served the district office.
I didn't.
I wasn't at all involved in student computers and stuff.
They had a teacher did that for him.
And he wasn't able to continue.
He moved on.
So they asked,
you know, can you come,
you know,
what's the whole school?
That was great.
But one of the first things,
a superintendent who was there then,
you know,
got still my friend now.
But, you know, he was,
you know, he was like,
yeah, you know,
and this was about the end of,
about the end of the time,
Apple giving away computers to schools almost.
But yeah,
we have these labs full of Apple computers.
But, you know,
when the kids graduate
and they go out in the world,
they're, you know,
they're going to be used windows.
And that was one of the first things I did was
sit down at the board and say,
yeah, you know,
that's right.
You're not going to see many Apple computers
in an office these days.
And so, you know,
from then on,
every computer they bought was a windows box.
So, you know,
having said that to this school,
a good 10 or more years ago,
you know,
I would like somebody to give me pointers.
Okay.
How do I say,
yeah, let's, let's go open source.
And it's just like a hook has been said.
We, you know,
we shouldn't be teaching an operating system.
We should be teaching computing.
You know, I agree with you.
And I know that Apple battle,
even in,
it's not just office that they get really cheap.
It's, uh,
the windows are less also
that they get practically free
because, you know,
they're just giving it away to schools.
So, I can't think of anything.
You know,
I'm not in that situation every day.
I work at a hospital, not a school.
But, um,
I can see where your,
your question is.
And, uh,
I would be interested in a good,
uh, the bottle plate also.
Well, it's not,
it's not even just Microsoft.
It's Adobe applications.
They're not,
they're not as incredibly ridiculously cheap as the,
as Microsoft,
but they're probably about half price.
Well, they got them off Apple.
Well,
they used to have the,
like the journalism class was,
well,
I guess it was still separate,
but they had a journalism teacher
or the English teacher taught journalism.
And she was like,
no, max her everything.
You gotta,
you gotta have a mac to do journalism.
And,
so the last thing we purchased,
like these two,
$1,800 G5s,
and that was about peripherals,
you know,
another $300 or whatever,
17-inch,
uh, monitors on the things,
but, uh,
you know,
they were dual processor,
but no, no, no,
these were single processor G5s.
But,
then the next year,
uh, the journalism teacher retired,
and the,
uh, computer teacher kind of took that over.
Uh, well,
computer teacher general things,
but, you know,
she had to lab full windows machines,
and they found out that these $400 windows machines
would run this Adobe software,
at least as well or better,
than the, uh,
then, uh,
$1,000 max.
But a lot of stuff
is facilitating this
just in the last couple of years.
A lot of this used to be client server-based,
on windows,
or, you know,
the,
well, the people doing the earpugs,
and essentially,
the people used to
sell you overpriced,
uh, class rings.
But,
you know,
they always used to insist everything,
uh,
coming out of,
uh,
uh,
the whole,
the whole huge Adobe suite,
trying to think of it.
Don't be imagined?
No, that's not it.
But what, you know,
but you had the Photoshop,
and,
and the publisher,
and all that stuff.
But,
now they've got everything essentially online for that.
So, you can,
you can do all your pre-work,
but essentially,
then you've got to take it,
and stick it in the online form,
and then all these other,
all this other software
that used to have to
run client server,
locally,
is,
is now all web-based,
as well.
So,
yeah,
there,
in less the people
who are,
who are,
who are running the web servers
or complete jerks,
everything can be
platform-agnostic.
I'd like to,
to,
the guy from Pennsylvania
tomorrow night,
I'd like to know,
how,
how they do any time,
if they're totally Linux
on,
on their backend,
first,
you know, servers go
and everything,
I'd like to know,
how,
how they manage,
student,
how they manage
these machines,
and they have a centralized,
are they using Red Hat,
or,
um,
no well,
and how,
if they have any type of,
like a,
like a,
like a,
Microsoft AD environment,
you know,
you can,
you know,
you can push out policies
to computers,
and if,
if there's any way to do that
on the Linux,
Linux side,
and how they,
authenticate
and to,
to a server,
that type of stuff,
that'd be something
to be interested in knowing,
that's always,
that was always my dilemma,
on trying to get,
I, you know,
thinking,
trying to suggest
a lab of Linux machines,
small lab,
of Linux machines
for students,
is how you would manage that,
and how you get students
to,
authenticate,
and,
and then they have to,
of course they have to
authenticate
into your,
or filter system,
or light speed system
for filtering,
you know,
it's a single sign
on now,
I mean, everything's just,
once they log
into a computer,
they,
they get the proper policies
through light speed,
which talks to the active directory
and everything,
you know,
it's, you know,
it's kind of seamless
on that side of it,
but,
I've never,
never tried it,
or investigated it too deeply,
on how you do that on Linux,
do that on Linux systems.
Yeah,
we had light speed
for about three years,
and, like I said,
until the reduction
in the size of the school,
it became,
for them,
cost prohibitive,
so,
we're just renting services,
on the,
on the router now,
for filtering,
but,
yeah, I'll see,
I'll see if they're doing
anything like that,
I,
I kind of got the impression
they were given students,
rude access,
they're,
they're Ubuntu laptops,
you know,
and encouraging them
to experiment,
but that's one of my questions,
well,
yeah,
but if they go around,
they completely,
they're,
they're playing with configurations
and stuff,
or they,
you know,
what they installed,
they completely
abort the system,
you know,
do you guys just say,
okay,
give me the laptop,
and we'll re-image it,
or, you know,
what happens then,
because you're teaching them Linux,
you're not really teaching them Linux,
unless they've got root.
Well, you're more
and welcome to join us tomorrow night.
I will try to make a point of it.
Same server and everything,
because I bet you could get your point across
on that question,
a lot better than,
than I can remember it by the way.
I mean, I,
I see where you're going,
but, you know,
like I said,
see, it seems to me,
central control is
across purposes
from teaching,
from teaching these students Linux.
I got to step out for just a minute,
and I'll be right back.
As Dude Man enters the room,
is he on you here still kebbing?
Oh, I think,
the gearbox is still here.
Speak up,
if you're still awake.
Yeah, I'm awake.
I'm just busy,
I'm working on some computers right now.
Tony,
are you a consultant,
or do you have a full-time
40-hour a week job,
or what do you do to earn money?
I'm a field tech
at a hospital
in other areas,
the Oakwood Health Systems,
and I do desites support,
so my offices in the hospital,
I receive tickets from the help desk,
and I walk out to the desk,
and neither fix,
you know,
printers, computers,
monitors,
and,
or either train people,
you know,
I do, you know,
more of user education,
and, like, click this,
click that,
I don't train on completely
on all their systems,
but, you know,
break-fix kind of things,
mainly.
Right, okay.
So, in other words,
you don't,
your Linux activity is
after hours.
Yeah, exactly.
I run my own small business,
you know, with hosting websites,
and doing computer repair,
and actually right now,
I'm tearing apart
of computer
processing and motherboard,
on a laptop,
but, you know,
everything I use
for running my business
is all Linux and open source,
and every chance I get
to get somebody to move over
or use Linux,
then,
I'll sell them a laptop with Linux,
but,
the majority of the time,
it ends up being there,
it already has the key for Windows,
so, I ended up just giving it
them with that.
But, I did get my parents,
my mom's on the Linux laptop,
and my sister is,
and a couple of people
got moved over.
How about you guys?
What's your day jumps?
I am a network system administrator,
a K-12,
a K-12 school system here,
where I originally went to high school,
and been there for four years now.
It's my first IT job.
I had a major career move.
When I took this job,
I got laid off from the
skill trades.
I was a, I was a,
from high school,
till four years ago,
I was a,
a German injection mold maker,
and then that got into the,
towards the latter,
ten years of,
that career I got into doing
the CAD design of injection molding.
So, I made,
I got laid off,
because of,
jobs being shipped,
overseas are,
this area is, you know,
of course,
like you, Tony's up,
around his major automotive industry here.
We got,
three or four Chrysler plants,
and then it used to be a big GM plant
that's almost down to nothing now,
but,
all the automotive jobs, you know,
stuff got,
just sending overseas,
and just really hurt the small,
job shop market around this area where it worked.
Yeah, you know,
the biggest thing that came out of,
with the,
the big three and,
and how, you know,
they were debating
whether they'd let the GM
and Chrysler go under
or bail them out,
and,
and if you think what,
the GM and Chrysler's only a third
of the, you know,
what's,
what goes into actually making the cars,
there's, you know,
two times more
than just GM and Chrysler
that's all the supporting companies
and even restaurants
and,
and businesses around them.
You know, my,
the main hospital I work at is,
is in Dearborn,
which is where Ford is at,
and there was a worries
whether Ford was going to be,
liquid enough to keep going,
or whether they were going to have to cut back,
and that would even affect us,
because if Ford were to pull out
or reduce workforce,
then people aren't going to be able to
afford to stay in the area
or get medical care.
So then, you know,
that, you know,
trickles down to the hospital in the area,
is going to have less,
you know, business.
Well, I always thought
the proper solution to that was
to send our fast attack subs out
and sink all the Japanese imports.
Funny, funny.
Now, Kevin, you talk,
you talk about the light speed server,
like I said,
the school decided they couldn't afford that service,
about three years ago,
and of course,
I'm sure where you are,
it's like we are,
it's provided by a third party company,
it's set it up and all that,
and it's their,
their lease server.
So, I pulled it out of the rack,
and told them to come pick up their server,
and it's like a dual processor,
dual core server,
it's been,
it's been sitting there three or four years,
and the school has no use for it,
because the server they've gotten now,
since everything has moved
to the web,
you know,
it's active directory
and a file server,
and that's about all it does.
You know, there's,
there's perfectly good rack server
or sitting on top of a pile of
single core laptops
that they waited too long to do anything with,
and they'll probably only,
they'll ever get rid of them
and send them to the dump.
I swear that thing
is going to find its way
in the back of my pickup
next time I'm up there.
Sometimes I miss not having
any kind of IT job,
you know,
not having access to
some of that old kit.
I would be pretty active
getting stuff into the back of my truck,
like you,
5150.
Well, most of the stuff
for years,
you know,
they've given me
when it's got,
you know,
when, you know,
I've got stacks of,
of,
uh,
penny and four dials
and the stuff
that the jober machines
they had before,
that,
uh,
but, you know,
it was,
all some of the stuff
they got in,
it was just too,
you know,
they took it offline,
they couldn't use it,
but,
they wouldn't sell it
to the faculty
or the students
or the members
of the community,
and they waited
till the stuff was useless,
you know,
it was like,
uh,
you know,
so the faculty machines,
what I took on them out,
I always did a D-band
and wiped it.
You know,
the student computers
I didn't do anything with,
because I figured,
well,
there probably
can't be anything on there,
maybe vulnerable,
viruses and stuff,
but,
you know,
as far as a secure,
you know,
as a privacy deal,
it shouldn't be
anything on there,
but they said,
you know,
came up,
oh,
a couple of summers ago,
they said,
you know,
they said,
well, you work on these computers,
and, you know,
and clean them up,
and, you know,
and the ones
that are wiped
will you put
when those back on,
and it's like,
look,
you know,
these computers
for enough money
to pay me
to look at them.
A couple of years ago,
when you had to come offline,
yeah,
maybe you could have.
They're just waiting too long here,
and then,
you don't have to wait long nowadays
for the computer
to become
out of date.
Yeah, I said,
you know,
these things are,
you know,
I'd be amazed
if you get 25 bucks out of them,
that's,
that's what I charge them
for an hour,
I'm cheap,
and,
you know,
I can't re,
install windows
and all the dry,
wipe them,
reinstall windows
and all the drivers
in an hour,
and update them.
Fold to the rescue.
You know,
I told them
you should have given
these things,
you know,
sold them for a little bit
of stuff they're
given away years ago,
and now,
you're just going to send,
I mean,
they did have their thing,
and, well, first,
the ones that I'd wiped,
you know,
they sent home with me,
so that's why I've got
so many of them.
But the others,
I get,
student machines,
and, you know,
a lot of them,
but they were like,
without documentation,
without,
you know,
without this,
probably,
because,
and,
good luck,
with, you know,
with those at home,
and it was a centralized
anti-virus system,
so the anti-virus
is no good to them.
But I guess they got
something out of them,
and then a couple of them,
didn't sell,
and they were on the,
they were on the trailer
to go to the dump
and the monitors,
I grabbed them,
because I've always had to
sell the trailer
to go to the dump,
you know,
iron or whatever,
if I can grab it,
that, you know,
that's cool,
old furniture stuff like that.
I've done that a few times,
but,
but they do have stack
of laptops in the corner,
you know,
that, you know,
single core laptops
that, yeah,
somebody installed Linux on them,
they would,
they would be usable.
With, with XP,
they're, they're not for crap.
Yeah, I'm sure you could find
some good homes for them,
you know,
for learning machines
and tinkering
and,
get some light
distro on there,
it could be useful.
Well, it's like my
truck club,
they want to have a few
for the officers
a few years ago,
as well.
Yeah, I could probably
get you these,
and it's,
there's got to be
six years ago now,
it's like, no, you know,
just complete indecision
and they're just still
sitting there in corners,
and it's like,
yeah,
well, there were a few,
well, a few of them
came with a grant,
and it,
well, it was,
they had come
with a couple of scanners,
and they said, you know,
after the first year,
they said, don't we want
them all, you know,
if the computer's
connected to the scanner dies,
we want them all
sent up with scanner
and webcams and all that,
and there was something
in there in one of the,
I think it was,
it was the,
the webcam program,
if you installed that,
it always,
when you shut down,
gave you two or three
errors you had
to close out of
in Windows.
But,
you know,
and your HP,
so you had the HP
update on top of the
Windows update,
installed by the fault,
which was completely
useless,
and always,
always nagging you,
and all that stuff,
and it's like,
yeah, I,
I could install Linux
distro on this,
I could, you know,
make a decent little
machine out of it,
but, you know,
forget it with XP,
it's beyond its day.
How long did you try
installed in ZoneMinder
sometime ago?
Oh, I installed
a server,
I don't think I spent
that long on it.
Like I said,
I've,
I've got those
cheap IP
cameras that came out
a year ago that were
easy to hack,
so,
which ones are they?
All those ones that are
about 60 bucks,
I'm trying to,
trying to think
of the name of them.
Can you connect to
a VLC,
or M-Player,
or something like that,
to the stream?
On the,
on the camera?
No.
Yeah.
So there's not
a VLC or a
M-R-T-P
kind of stream.
Well, it's a web,
it's a web server
on the camera.
I'm pretty sure
they must be,
like a network,
eight URL
that you can type in
from a browser,
or maybe not a browser,
but definitely
from VLC
and just stream the,
the video.
I think this fairly
normal on,
on even the cheapest ones.
Well, that may be
possible then.
It was like,
I don't know,
I installed ZoneMinder,
I can't remember
what it was,
but it never seemed
like it even started
working right.
It's, I mean,
I tried it
about a year ago.
I mean, when,
we used to chat
on the,
the logs on Saturday
mornings.
And I just,
I got the impression
that it was easier to set
up and install
and it would just work
and I gave up
too soon, you know.
And this time,
I really wanted to get it
to work and,
and have, you know.
But I spent a long
time playing with it,
but it's working.
And,
and I'm really impressed
with it as well,
actually.
And I, I have a pretty
cheap webcam.
I, I, I,
I PCAM,
and I'm trying to get
a few more as well.
But I've been
invested in what model
you got, you know.
If it was,
it was something that was
easy to hack.
What is,
let me go look
at real quick,
I can tell you.
Thanks,
50.
The webcam's
really saved my life
because,
how can I,
I installed a really
simple webcam in,
in the cowshed,
just before they were
giving birth,
a few days before they
should give birth.
And I was able to not
have to keep going out
of the shed every 20
minutes to see if
should give birth yet.
But I could sit
in the comfort of my own
computer.
And just the moment the
baby came out,
the little calf came out,
I could go out and deal
with it, you know.
It's wonderful.
That's me.
And is that
where you use the
Zornminder? It was to,
you know,
whenever they started
having an activity,
or I guess they're
always moving,
so it would be hard
to use the Zornminder
because, you know,
when I have it on,
I'm kind of just testing it.
I want to get some more
webcams around the house,
kind of on the front entry
ways and what have you.
But I'm waiting for them,
for me, baby.
But, um,
so I'm just testing out
with motion detection.
And it's interesting to see
how much they stand up
and sit down.
And I have a problem,
there's always chickens
walking past, you know.
So they alerted,
but, um,
it's no problem.
But it's really nice to
be able to sit inside
and see what the hell they
get up to, you know.
I have to keep going
out and seeing what they're
doing.
And they don't know
what they're doing.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, the brand
is Fawzcam.
I should have remembered that.
Would they like
make a pixel?
Well, they're,
they do have,
they, they have audio,
they have, uh,
tilt and pan.
And I,
I think they're like,
uh, maximum 640 by 480.
And you got yours
off eBay, did you?
Uh, link,
uh, link on, uh,
woot, deals.woot.com.
They're not hard to find.
Ah, these are kind of
indoor, um,
cams with Wi-Fi,
little antennas,
are they?
Yeah, but they also
have ethernet.
You have to set them
up via the Wi-Fi,
uh, because they act
as a server.
So you got to connect
to them first through,
uh, through Wi-Fi,
but if you, you know,
but then you could
set a static address
on them and, uh,
plug in the cable
ethernet.
Yeah, but I've got
something a bit similar
to this.
A bit more expensive,
kind of a better brand
one, um,
kind of an indoor camera,
but without the, uh,
the Wi-Fi.
I'll be surprised.
I mean, um,
all the IP cameras,
I think, have a web
interface on them
and, uh, kind of,
a little server,
a little Linux server.
I'll be really surprised,
51.
If you wanted to get it work,
and I bet you could,
you've just got to, you know,
look in the settings
and find, um,
you know,
there must be like a network
section in the settings,
and there it would specify,
either HTTP,
kind of stream connection
point or a sign called RTP.
And then you can use that URL
in the port inside, uh,
um, VLC or emPlayer.
And you can test that you can,
view remotely.
And you could do best,
just basically use those
settings in the, uh,
zoneMinder.
But it isn't terribly intuitive
to, um,
to know how to get the zoneMinder
going.
You do have to read the docs,
which I'm not very good at,
but I finally did after,
banging my head up
against the wall.
Well, I'll have to get back
to that sometime because,
well, one of the things
that I found I didn't like,
uh, if I,
if I hit them through,
through a,
uh,
PC,
I,
the, the,
the PAN works fine,
but if I try to do it
through an Android device,
the controls
don't work at all.
It has an ActiveX
control.
That's what all the cheap ones
I think, um,
are limited by.
Well, you're probably right,
but there's an ActiveX
login page,
and there's a not an
ActiveX login page.
All right.
On my one,
it has only ActiveX
and it's a real pain
in the ass,
so I have to run
Internet Explorer
under wine, um,
just to,
to, uh,
to move it around,
you know,
but I don't use it,
you know,
I don't,
I don't use it to move
around too much.
We'll see these,
when they lose power
and they reset,
they kind of point up
to the ceilings,
they almost have to have.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But,
are you going to watch
just out your front gate
or animals,
or?
Well, my dad is
close to being
involved, you know,
so I've got one in the living room
where I can,
you know,
I can log in,
watch him if I,
if I need to.
That's a good idea.
I do,
I do have one out
the machine shed,
uh,
that I can connect to.
Kind of as a security.
So,
exactly.
And, uh,
how, you know,
I don't use them
as much as I should.
I mean,
I got, when I first
put them in,
I played them as a toy
and then, you know,
but the one thing, you know,
they're both,
they're both LED.
And...
Oh, the infrared,
that's really nice.
Yeah, they're infrared.
But,
at least the one out in the shed,
I don't know.
It seemed like the LED,
maybe overused,
or whatever.
It doesn't have the range
that it used to do
when it's completely dark.
And somebody,
I was actually the,
uh,
guy in the Sheriff's Department,
he said,
well, all you need to do
is set up a row of LEDs
against the back wall
and leave them,
you know,
leave them lit up all the time.
You know, it's a great,
high surprise.
That's a great idea.
You, you can also
get really cheap off eBay.
These kind of,
just, just,
infrared LED lights,
which have, like,
a light sensor,
so they only turn on
in low light conditions.
And, um,
they can go, like,
20, 50 meters,
you can get all sorts
of different power ones.
And it was, like,
I got one for about
$15 or $10 or so,
and, um,
so you just plug the power
and point it in the same
direction as your camera
and, uh,
it can extend the range.
And I did have,
well, I still do,
not that I pay much attention,
because it's, uh,
they do have motion sensors
on these cameras.
And I set the one up
in the machine and
shed motion sensor,
whatever,
every time I look at it,
I see,
I see sequence of pictures
and I don't know what it
sees moving.
So,
I don't know if it's the
cats out there,
or what it is,
but I, you know,
I think I just had
the wrong button press
when I was going to tell you
that you can get, uh,
external infrared lights,
which have light sensors,
so they only work
at nighttime.
Cheap off eBay,
I picked up one for our
$5 or $10.
And so you can extend the range,
you know,
up to 50 meters,
something like that.
No, I heard that,
you know,
that's exactly what I was
thinking of when, you know,
I just have it.
You know, it's like,
I have so many interesting
projects to do,
and it's,
it's like,
because there's so many
of them,
none of them ever
get done.
Less like me as well,
50.
And I go through
faces where I try not
to do any other job,
so I take some time
off work,
and then I kind of push
forward a little bit.
I buy some more gadgets,
but it's never quite finished,
you know.
I was really pleased
with myself.
I got the zone
minder and some other stuff,
I'm working on one of
these old,
old droid little devices,
which I want to set up
as the zone minder,
kind of monitor
for all the webcams.
Yeah.
How are you going
with the old droid?
Uh, I,
I know Jezz
or has talked about,
you know,
he put his into
making a clock or something,
because he just got tired.
Uh, but,
and I have,
I've noticed,
I've had a couple
different distros on them,
and it's like,
maybe it's what
I'm doing,
it seems like,
you know,
I'll use it
half a dozen times,
and then it won't
boot to the same card,
and,
but the card,
you know, I can,
I can read right to the card,
I can read, you know,
I can reflash the card,
so doesn't seem like
that's it.
Did you ever get
one of those,
did you ever get one of those,
kind of,
the, the high speed
memory modules,
I think it's called
EMMCP modules,
with it?
No, I have it.
I would definitely recommend that,
I mean, it's,
it's as fast as an SSD card,
and, um,
it's much more reliable
if you have any,
um, power cuts,
the,
the, um,
SD card,
sorry, the,
the memory cards,
SD cards,
I find so unreliable,
even with the little
Raspberry Pi,
I have, you know,
you get a few,
and power failures,
and the damn thing won't boot,
and you've got to take it off,
and put it somewhere else,
and do a file system check,
and we'll have you,
it's, um,
so I think you,
I've never had any
problems, like you mentioned,
with that,
with that memory card,
and it's much faster.
Oh, I didn't realize
that could be the problem,
okay, yeah,
I never got,
because it seems so much
more expensive,
but, uh,
if, if,
if that's the limiting factor,
definitely it's the way to go.
It's so fast as well,
I mean,
I just bought one out,
the U3,
which is, um,
the same power
and specs as the X2,
but, um,
instead of 120 or 150 dollars,
it's only 50,
58 dollars,
and I bought one of those,
uh,
a 64 gigabyte,
um,
one of those memory cards,
and, you know,
I'm seriously thinking about,
just getting another one,
for my wife,
for her computer, you know,
you see,
it's so much less power,
and it's,
it's pretty powerful.
I really like it.
Well, the difference is mainly
less USB port, isn't it?
That's right,
and you haven't got that big,
um,
expansion,
expansion port as well,
um,
that there's a small,
kind of serial port,
so you can,
you can plug,
uh,
they've got a, like,
a little, um,
daughterboard,
uh,
for Arduino,
if you like,
we're like a,
bolt in Arduino,
board on to it,
which they have,
which I've got as well.
Oh, okay,
because,
yeah, that,
that long,
uh,
connector they had was
really only to,
uh,
plug-in video,
and turn into a tablet,
I've never seen anything,
where they were actually,
you,
you know,
using that as the pinouts,
like, on the Raspberry Pi.
You, you could do,
um, you know,
you'd need to plug some of,
uh,
board on to it.
I mean,
if you,
uh,
plug-in stuff in,
you could take those
IO ports off.
But the,
you free it,
I'm,
I'd be really surprised,
if, um,
the, the price point
and the power of it,
uh,
I'm amazed that more people
with Raspberry Pi
don't get it,
because,
I've got a Raspberry Pi
and it's just so damn slow,
you know,
it's,
it's really,
it means a good thing,
but, um,
for just twice the money,
you know,
you can get,
a fork or,
oh, draw it,
and it's so much nipier.
Is that the one
at all so that the,
it's,
it's sort of the case,
acts as a heat sink?
No, they're,
they've changed the design a bit.
It's,
it's, I mean,
it's even smaller.
It's about the size
of a credit card now.
And, um,
and they,
you can buy,
they have a little plastic box,
um,
that they've made nicely,
and you can,
get a little plastic box,
as well, for it.
Um,
you can get, uh,
like an extra fan,
if you can over-clock it,
if you're worried about it,
overheating,
and more,
um,
for the same price point
as the X2 from,
from last year,
they have a,
an 8 core,
um,
a,
a 15,
um,
version.
And, uh,
I think it, I don't know if you've heard about it,
but it works in,
like, a little,
or big,
big mode,
where, if you're not using it much,
it uses four of the,
the slower processors,
and if you really want a lot of power,
it switches over to using four of the,
of the,
