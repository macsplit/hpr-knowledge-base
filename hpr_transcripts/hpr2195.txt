About HPR History Hacker Public Radio HPR is an internet radio show,
podcast that releases shows every week they Monday through Friday.
HPR has a long lineage going back to radio-free America, binary revolution radio and
infinomicon, and it is a direct continuation of TWATIC radio.
Please listen to Stank Dog's introduction to HPR for more information.
The HPR community.
What differentiates HPR from other podcasts is that the shows are crowdsourced from the
community, fellow listeners like you.
There is no restriction on how long the show can be, nor on the topic you can cover, as
long as they are not spam and are of interest to hackers.
If you want to see what topics have been covered so far just have a look at our archive.
We also allowed for a series of shows so that hosts can go into more detail on a topic.
You can download listen to the shows here, or you can subscribe to the show in your favorite
podcasting client to automatically get our new shows, as soon as they are available.
You can copy and redistribute the shows for free provided you adhere to the creative
commons attribution shareer like 3.0 license.
Free culture.
Hacker Public Radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge.
We do not accept donations so please consider supporting our patrons.
If you listen to HPR, then we would love you to contribute one show a year.
Our shows are by default released under a creative commons attribution shareer like
3.0 imported license.
All the software we use is free software.

Governance.
HPR is entirely community driven.
Community decisions are proposed and discussed on the mailing list, which is open to anyone
to join.
Mailing list discussions are brought to the attention of the listening community on the
first Monday of the month in the HPR community news show.
This show is also open to anyone to participate in.
Our hosting is kindly provided to us by Josh Naft from an HonestHose.com and he has the
last word in issues related to site security.
A changing team of volunteers call the admins or janitors deal with the day-to-day operation
of HPR.
Acting as the first point of contact, processing the shows, coordinating policy discussions,
removing spam, updating the website, etc.
They are contactable via the email account admin at HPR.
They have no more say over policy than anyone else.
Anyone who has shown a long-term dedication to the project and is trusted by the community
can become of admin.
So you want to do a podcast well you've come to the right place.
Our goal here at HPR is to make it as easy as possible for you to get a podcast released.
We take care of the hard bits so you don't need to.
Recording your first show is always a daunting prospect, but over 324 people like yourself
have done it and so can you.
Stuff you need to know HPR will stop as a project if there are not enough shows.
We do not syndicate shows not produced for HPR.
You are agreeing to license your show CC by SA.
You have permission to redistribute your show in its entirety.
Your show will not be moderated.
Your show will be signaled as containing explicit content.
You determine where in the schedule your show will be released.
We use UTF-A end to end.
Your show will be heard by an international audience.
We also need emergency shows.
You will no longer be allowed to edit HPR pages on Wikipedia.
More information about the stuff you need to know.
This is some important information that you will need to know before uploading to HPR.
HPR will stop as a project if there are not enough shows.
Our public radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge.
We release about 260 shows a year, which is probably more than all of the other false podcasts
put together.
If you listen to HPR, then we would love you to contribute one show a year.
Remember once that all the emergency shows have been used up and there are no more shows
in the queue, HPR is a project will stop.
Support our patrons.
Our hosting is kindly provided to us by Josh Naft from an honesthost.com and the internet
archive at archive.org.
We encourage you to support our patrons.
Over the years kind people have donated services and supported equipment for our conferences.
We do not syndicate non-HPR shows.
HPR is founded on the principle of hackers sharing knowledge.
For this reason we are only releasing material created exclusively for HPR.
We will continue to promote new podcasts and other creative commons material, but if
you wish to have your show aggregated, then please contact our sister site hacker media.
That said, if there is a piece of creative commons content that you would like to promote,
then feel free to record a regular show.
There you can introduce the content and explain why it is important, providing links to
where we can get more information etc and then include one example episode.
You are agreeing to license your show CC by SA.
All our shows are now released under a creative commons attribution share like 3.0 unported
license, which means that while you continue to retain the copyright to your show, you
are allowing us and everyone else to use it provided we give you attribution and that
we release it under the same license.
Click the link for more information.
You have permission to redistribute your show in its entirety.
Never include content, for example music, in your show, that you do not have permission
to redistribute.
Try to avoid using any content in your show that cannot be redistributed under a creative
commons attribution share like 3.0 unported license.
If you are redistributing under another creative commons license or by arranged permission
please make note of the restrictions when you upload your show.
We can then signal that so that others who redistribute HPR content can filter your show
out.
Your show will not be moderated.
We do not vet, edit, moderate or in any way sense or any of the shows on the network,
we trust you to do that.
Aside from checking snippets for audio quality spam checking, we have a policy that we
don't listen to the shows before they are aired.
This is a long-standing traditional rising from the fact that HPR is a community of peers
who believe that any host has as much right to submit shows as any other.
Your show will be signaled as containing explicit content.
Given that we are an open forum for free speech we signal all our shows as explicit with
the assumption that the listeners will apply the required discretion when playing the
shows in public.
But said the majority of our content is technical in nature and therefore is often considered
appropriate for any audience.
If you feel that your show will be considered inoffensive in every region of the world
then you can signal that when you upload the show.
When dealing with content that is explicit or contains material that would best be suited
for a mature audience it has become traditional to include a short warning at the very beginning
of the show before the intro to allow a listener's time to switch off the episode should
they so desire.
You determine when your show will be released.
The HPR schedule is entirely community driven and we recommend that you pick the date or
show number as then you know when your show will be released.
However the slots will only be allocated once the shows have been successfully processed.
Any missing information can result in a show missing the requested slot.
As the slots have been allocated it is not possible to move them.
All reservations need to be approved.
In the case where you wish to reserve a particular slot but do not have the media recorded you
will need to get the reservation approved in advance by the HPR mailing list.
The following are standing reservations.
Anniversary episodes HPR community news on the first Monday of the month.
The first day of the fourth month.
The days following new year.
We use UTF-8 end to end.
See the video characters, symbols and the unicode miracle, computer file for an interesting
background to ask you and UTF-8.
Your show will be heard by an international audience.
We have people listening from all over the world who may not have the same cultural background
as yourself, therefore you should be as clear as possible when giving details.
For example always give temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
In metric and imperial, dates in YYYYMMDDISO8601 format and abbreviations using the NATO phonetic
alphabet.
Never assume that your audience knows what age a sixth grader is or how big a 20 cent
Euro coin is.
Keep in mind that keyboard layouts are also different so make sure to specify the key
shape or the position in relation to a common known standard.
For example, the its sign normally situated above the two key on a US keyboard and has
a unicode number of U plus 0, 0, 0, 0.
For more information see Wikipedia feed the emergency queue.
The emergency queue is intended only to be used in the cases where there is still a gap
in the schedule 24 hours prior to release.
The shows will buy their very nature need to be timeless.
It means your topic should still be relevant in four years or more.
People will be able to hear the show on the website, but they will not be included in
any feeds until release.
Please begin all shows with text similar to.
This is an emergency show if you are hearing this THPR need shows ASAP.
Please consider contributing a show.
Email admin at hackerpublicradio.org for more information.
We expect that we need at least 10 shows in the emergency queue in order to give people
enough time to record and submit shows.
Please contact admin at HPR if you want to submit an emergency show.
You will no longer be allowed to edit HPR pages on Wikipedia.
Once you upload a show, you will no longer be allowed to edit pages relating to hacker
public radio in Wikipedia.
All policy decisions are made by the HPR community.
The community decides the HPR policies.
Please join the HPR mailing list to participate.
Select a topic the first thing you will need to do is decide on a topic for your show.
You might already have an idea, but if not you can have a look at our archive page for
examples of shows people have recorded in the past.
You can also look at our requested topics or our series page to see if you can add your
knowledge to the pool.
More information about recording a podcast on this page you will find information on
how to record a podcast.
Our golden rule as any audio is better than no audio.
So keep that in mind.
Don't forget to introduce yourself in your show.
Recording with a portable media player many of today's portable media players support
recording audio out of the box.
Search for voice recorder to see if there is an application for your smartphone.
As ever option you have close to hand, try and set the recording to the best quality
format, hover flack and set everything else to the highest setting.
It's always the goal to get the best quality audio, but here at Hacker Public Radio we
value content over quality and so long as it's audible we'll take it.
Then just record your show, request a slot and we'll do the rest.
Recording editing using your computer the majority of podcasters use audacity.
First set the project rate to 44,100 hertz, then you can either record your show in audacity
itself or import the file you recorded earlier and edit it as you wish.
Audacity is a free, easy to use and multi-lingual audio editor and recorder for Windows, Mac OSX,
New Linux and other operating systems.
When you have finished editing your podcast you can export it.
Confirm that the project rate is set to 44,100 hertz, bottom left, file export and select
flack file.
Click options to review flack export setup.
Set level to 8, best.
Set bit depth to 24.
Recording interviews with the phone if you want to record a one-to-one interview with
someone then you can use Skype in conjunction with Skype call recorder.
If everyone is using Skype then it won't cost you anything otherwise you will need to
pay for Skype out service.
Although the quality is usually terrible, you could also put your phone on hands free
and record with a portable media player.
Recording roundtable discussions if you would like to record with multiple participants
then you can use mumble.
Connect to CH1.teamspeak.cc port 64,747.
Walk through the audio wizard and then pop into the hacker public radio room.
Once you are ready press the recording button, select multi-channel and then start.
That will record multiple tracks, one for each participant which you can edit and then
submit.
K-Wisher has made a mumble tutorial which you might find useful in Delwin has produced
a number of short shows on how to configure the audio quality.
With betting background music you may include backing music but it's best if you don't.
Most long time podcast listeners speed up their shows as this allows them to cram more shows
into a day.
Others will convert shows to mono to listen in one ear leaving the other free to carry out
their other chores.
Still more slow the shows down so that they can improve their English.
Others are hard of hearing and backing music makes it difficult to understand the text.
We mix down to mono we will buy default mix down your show to one channel mono and we
will transcode to MP3, augundspx formats.
If you want to control this in more detail then please email admin at hacker public radio
for more information.
No need to add metadata to the file there is no need to add any information to the file
is that will be inserted based on the information you fill in when you upload the show.
Don't forget to introduce yourself in your show.
Requesting a slot for your show you should have your audio recording ready to upload before
you request a slot.
In the case where you wish to reserve a particular slot but do not have the media recorded you
will need to get the reservation approved in advance by sending an email to the hpr mailing
list.
Be sure to allow as much time as possible and include a reason why you feel it is necessary
to reserve a slot.
You can post your show by going to the calendar page.
Once you have selected a date you will be redirected to the request page where you will
be asked to select your show and email address.
We will send a link to where you can upload your show to this address and therefore it
must be a valid working address that you can access quickly.
We use GPG to speed up the validation of hosts so you may wish to use an email address
that has an associated public key available on public key servers.
Note.
This email address will be published on the hpr website and will be given out in the
feeds so please use a public email address for this purpose.
Where we publish it we pad it with dot nospam at sign no spam dot idhpr at example dot com

It is important to provide good show notes because they provide the listeners with more information
on the topic.
You have taken the time to record a show on a topic so many people will want to find out more
on the subject, therefore you should include links to give more information.
It is not enough to just give it in the show itself as people may be listening
while away from the internet and they may have forgotten or misheard your links.
They ensure your show gets posted on time.
If you do not supply show notes then your show notes will need to be edited manually by an HPR
volunteer and this will most likely result in delays.
During that time other shows will be processed and may get posted before your show.
It is always better if you send us show notes yourself as you know best what information you are trying to convey.
They encourage people to download your show.
We produce a lot of shows and many people download based on the text in the show notes.
If the show notes are not descriptive then it is less likely that it will get as many downloads as other shows with good show notes.
They allow your show to be indexed by search engines.
Search engines cannot determine the content of your show from the audio alone.
The only way for your show to be indexed is for you to describe in the associated text what you say in the audio.
They make your show accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing.
Your audio is completely inaccessible to those who have hearing problems so the only way for your show to be of help to them is if you distill the essence of the show into the show notes.
If you are using a script to prepare your show then include that.
The amount you can enter is restricted to 4000 characters but you can provide additional show notes if you wish.

Regardless of the format you send your show notes will end up in HTML5 article section where the header and footer are not available to you.
Avoid using diverse band tags. The inclusion of JavaScript will send your show into quarantine until an experienced HP R volunteer can be found to debug it.
It takes us a lot longer to fix and correctly formatted show notes than plain text so please only create formatted show notes if you know what you are doing and are sure that what you are writing is valid.
