Hello, welcome to Hacker Public Radio News for February 2011
In this show we're rounding up the last month news from the HPR community
Well at least as much as I have seen
First of all I'd like to welcome three new hosts to the network
dismal science and 50 and bro welcome onboard
look forward to hearing more shows from you guys in the future
With an interesting start to the month with episode 632 by droops
the notebook method for dealing with ADHD
and by explaining how he copes with ADHD
we do get a glimpse into how difficult it must be to live with this condition
then the next we had Scarlet with the language frontier episode 1
and I suspect that many common misconceptions will be shattered by the end of all promises to be an excellent series on language
Clat 2 come along with urban camping episode 5 finding food
never want to shrink from controversy in this episode Clat 2 calls into question the morality of food supply
dismal science brought us cloudy predictions
a new host brings us a wake up call about the realities of cloud computing
will the people footing the bill keep footing the bill that's the question
we are pokey with kid 3-Qt
first of all big apologies to pokey for forgetting to add a shot to the calendar that was completely my fault
and in the show pokey give us a run through of the KD application for adding metadata to all your files
and greetings from Holland to his mother who listens to his shows and I hope she listens to this one as well
and you know she's not exempt from the New Year's resolution that every listener of HPR should try and send in a show to HPR
but more about that later
the following day we had brother mouse with his everyday carry
and this series was started by Dave 68 and brother mouse continues the tradition of letting us know what's in his daily carry
he's a Texan so side arm and knife wasn't that much of a surprise but sadly there was no mention of his hat
followed on by urban camping episode 6 and Clat 2 gave us money saving tips
and this has actually prompted me to do an episode on the way in which we've saved quite a bit of money
and if you've got some tips too it's an ideal time to send them in to HPR
aptly droops came in with podcaster not radio keep it short keep it sweet keep it to the point
this is message there is no time constraints on HPR and if you want to send us in a five minute tip
send us in a five minute tip ideally we'll have a nice balance of show mixes
I think the longest one we've had is three something hours and the shortest one was just under two minutes
so there is no need to waffle if you don't want to of course you can if you want
then we had pipe man music above microphones where he gave us the down and dirty about audio
and he has given us some useful information on microphones
I actually don't like to hear these shows because I know I'm going to have to stop
and listen to them over and over again because they're so interesting
so this series will be referenced near and far that's for sure
Clat 2 urban camping episode 7 come next and this is the last in the series
and to be honest I'm sad to see it go I hope he does do some shows on feedback
or does other variations on it
not to say that I've turned into a very good or anything but it has made me look at the world a little differently
and that's always a good thing
Brother Mouse came on with another show
second of his three shows this month hacking your suburban backyard with chickens
and that's proof that you have no clue about what's going to come up on HPR the next day
and it took me a while to figure out what he meant by tractor
so if you don't know go to the links in the show notes and you will find out
Drupes had a hots on my MP3 player and I hated this show as well
because now I've an even longer list of podcasts that I have to listen to
but a cool show there as well
and then for show from N50
the Plop Boop manager and UNEP Bootin at a great team
this was a really cool show
it's amazing actually how many people are busy recycling computer systems
seems to be a thing going through the community at the minute
and this has given me ideas for two PCs that are sitting down in the basement that I was going to chuck
but I might be able to bring them back to life with some with this information here
and then we had Corbuntu and Bailey Juran with the dinosaurs dilemma
and this is a story of someone who wants to make the shift into the world of Geekton
and wants to bring us along for the ride
the following day we had a dismal science questioning whether we needed an android carrier plan
this is one of the ones where you realize that each market is different
for example here in the Netherlands we don't have an abundance of free open Wi-Fi
both we do have a limited data plans for 10 euros a month
but interesting nonetheless got some good tips out of that show
and then we had a brother mouse with how I got into Linux
I always find these interesting we had some audio issues with this show
actually and turns out the reason was that the sample rate of 1105 instead of
what 4400
I always check all the shows with emplier before and after I upload them
as well as checking them when I download them
and it turns out that emplier can handle these absolutely fine
but all the media players like VLC can't
I wanted to thank Claudia M for pointing this out to us
so I've added yet another step to my upload process in the morning
where I checked the shows with VLC before and after downloading
so but if you notice any problems with sound
please send me emails they admin at hackupopricradio.org
don't assume that somebody else will
I'm rather get my mailbox filled up with
with notifications than not knowing about it
okay I've uploaded a version again so if you had problems
playing that show that's episode 647
if you had problems playing that you can go ahead and download it again
the following day I did a quick 5 minute
episode on command line utility W put
I'm taking a lesson here from droops
I wanted to release some short shows that highlight some of the small
programs that I use that might not be that well known and I have a few more
coming and I'm always interested to hear yours as well
as long as you don't pick the ones that I intend to do
okay right after this broker
anyway the following day we had quim moth
sorry for butching your handles
and phantom hawk doing your own auto repairs
oh this one cracked me off
not because of the show but it brought me back to
times when I used my first car which was
an old mark 3 for the escort
actually was on mark 1 for the escort
no it was a mark 3
and doing my own auto repairs on that
remember one cold new year's eve the whole
front steering thing came off one of
wheels the wheel came off and had to replace the whole thing
on my parents front
yard actually was a very good night as long as I went in eventually
and the following day was last show and that was brome
dumpster diving another one and rescuing all
stuff and putting it to use
this is his first show and I definitely hope not
last I'd like to thank everybody who has contributed
this month some of the old regulars and indeed
some new hosts and some of the old hosts
have decided to come back into the
fold and now how to podcast
by phone
hello and welcome to the hacker
public radio audio cast recording line
number one please begin recording after the
tone when you are finished recording
press the pound key and your submission will be
automatically delivered to hacker public radio
for publication
hello everybody my name is Ken Fallon and this is
a absolute on hbr on how to do a podcast
by using the public telephone network
a few weeks ago I asked a few days ago in fact I asked
would it be possible for us to set up
a telephone line that we could use to record
podcasts the idea being to lower the barrier
of entry for somebody who might want to
record a show as you all know my goal is
to have everybody who listens to the hacker public radio
network contributes one show a year and then we would have no
problems filling our roster it came to my attention
that pokies mom has
is also a listener and may be confused by
the intricacies of recording a show that people
who traditionally work with computers from day
day in day out might have problems with
as a result this idea came into my head and I posted
a request on hbr mailing list for suggestions
to do this after some discussion
Russ Woodman K5 Talks
volunteered his services
specifically that of his asterisk box and his
subscription which he is paying dearly for every month
to provide us with some infrastructure
in which to record shows so I am picking up the telephone line
from here in the Netherlands and I dialed
the number area code international
one for the US and then area code
206-312-5749
this would be in the show notes
206-312-5749
and I dialed in and the first thing I heard was Russ
to giving a welcome message
and at the end I should press the hash symbol
and once I do that the show will automatically be emailed
to or will be uploaded to the ftp size
where I in my persona
as hbr admin will download it and
at the intro and outro music and publish
so it's all very exciting stuff you are now listening
to history we met here on the hbr network
so folks there is absolutely no barriers remaining
on how you can send in a show
and if you
for some reason have
unable to vocalize your
shows you can always send them in
prepared script
and we will read them out
or we will do a text-to-speech conversion
so that they can go out
on the hbr network
I would like to thank everybody who has been
involved in this discussion
Phoenix included
but especially Russ
for putting the service
for us here available on the hbr
and I would like to encourage you all
to record some shows
it's fantastic
and remember
to include your name
and contact information
because otherwise I won't know who is
who to attribute the show to
okay
thank you very much
and I will talk to you
later
thank you for using
this Hacker Public Radio
audio cast recording line
your recording has been submitted
goodbye
hello and welcome to the Hacker Public Radio
audio cast recording line
number one
please begin recording after the tone
when you are finished recording
press the pound key
and your submission will be automatically delivered
to Hacker Public Radio
for publication

octotorp pound sign
or it won't work
and again thanks to Russ
and Aaron for sorting this out
absolutely
the coolest thing i hope you can tell
that i'm super excited by this
ok first of all
last month i promised to give you a little update
on automation and the RSS feed
the RSS feed is delayed
because it requires changes to the database
i've had
reports of problems from
Riddabucks by Bill Plants
and problems with G-Potter
reported by Larry Bushy
from the going Linux podcast
to
former to the feed and first of all
I'm chuffed that Larry listens to the show
and if you
are not familiar with going Linux podcast
please go over
and
check those guys out
so that's the RSS feed
the reason for that
is that we require a database change
and the reason we
require database change is because
of the encoding of the
HTML that we're using
i am also
working on a website
update
i don't want to announce now
but unfortunately it's another thing
i can roll out in stages
all or nothing is typed
because we are requiring database changes
and hopefully when that's done
you'll be able to go
to the website
and press upload and then
be able to upload the show
each host will be able to
log in and
upload their own shows that way
and manage their own metadata that way
and
I don't know if you could get that
thanks
and
yes you're going to need a
function and email
address for that to work
so anyway now I want to get on to
another topic that has come up
and that is syndicated shows
and I sent this email out on
the mailing list
so I'm running into some
difficulties with how best
to address syndicated shows so
I'd appreciate your feedback
basically the background is I'm trying
to specify scheduling rules
to be fair with everybody but also
with a view to automating the task
I've taken a view that shows
for HPR get priority to the schedule
and get schedule before syndicated shows
but this brings into the question
what exactly is a syndicated show
so if a show is
posted to an RSS feed
before it's been posted
to HPR
then it's simple it's a syndicated show
however we have had a
resubmission on the series
that was on a podcast
that fitted
so probably nobody's ever heard these
shows so are these ones
syndicated or not that's a question
or do I schedule them as a regular HPR show
we've also had
submissions from a host
that post to the HPR
FTP server at the same time
as the post to their own
so they get
because of the daily in scheduling
they come out later on HPR
then they do on a zone RSS feed
so are these syndicated shows
then after hearing
episode 635
Disminal Sciences
that Evan Mulgroom
gave called Freedom
in the Cloud software
Freedom Privacy for Web2.0
and Cloud Computing
as a meeting of the internet society
New York branch
February 5th, 2010
which I thought
would be ideal for HPR
and 5150
email me to say that
I have I quote
I notice that there haven't been any recordings
for submissions
where meetings
or talks from various
fest are already recorded
but with the schedule rules
that we already have at the moment
syndicated shows don't ever get played
and the scheduling rules
are time critical
goes first
scheduled slots
go second
new host gets bumped to the top
HPR contest comes first
so playing shows
we never play syndicated hosts
we never play
and
other stuff
now on the other side
we've had comments from people
saying that in the last few months
the floodgates really opened
on HPR feed and they can't
keep up with the amount of podcasts
that we're releasing
so I'd like to float the idea here
of reserving Tuesday and Thursday
get a chills for
lugs talks for speeches
any sort of thing that you think might be of interest
to the community
even releasing
man pages read by
Danny speaker Lin
so of course
your feedback is very much welcome
at the mailing list
which is HackerPublicRadio.org
follow slash mailing list
and if you're not on the mailing list
please join it
on
so please join that
moving on
I am running a design competition
at the moment
and I'd like to have some
many business cards met
the idea being that we give them out at shows
to people interested in recording a show
or to potential interview ease
I've seen them add a touch of professionalism
to recorded DVDs
or CDs
and despite watching
one of screen savers.heavenx.org
I'm still lacking
anything approaching artistic flair
so I'm putting the call out
here for anybody to help me design
some business cards
Clattery is already
sent in submissions
so you can
do so too
so let's talk about the back first
it should have the QR code
to HackerPublicRadio.org's
about page
so that from there
anybody with an iPhone
or an Android phone can scan the barcode
immediately go to our about page
see what we are
and then there's links to everything else from there
everything else on the back
can be pretty much
whatever you like
I've linked in the show notes
my first attempt which is basically
a whole go of
you know all our contact information
now we have a lot more freedom to do
what we want with the front
and I can upload a hundred different versions
for a print run
so it's very very likely that
if you send in anything
it will get submitted so feel free
to send in various different options
for the for the front
so more or less
can guarantee that if you send in the submission
at least the front
will get printed on one or two business cards
and then we'll have the
competition for the actual back
itself
and
the guidelines
I'm having a print by mood
which somebody recommended to me
I have no affiliation with them
if you want to recommend
where I can get them printed somewhere else
that would be great
the design guidelines is
874 by 378
at 300 dpi but you can
go to the website for more information
on that
the idea would be
as well that
we might use some of this
for changing the design
of the website
and for
using it in other places
and the price of course
is my eternal gratitude
and the gratitude of everybody
on the planet
for not having to submit
subject my art
but seriously
if you give me your mail address
I'll send you on some
some of the cards
with your design on them
I'll send you off some HPR stickers
and if you're willing to pay the postage
or come and pick them up
or meet me at one of the fest
or something
you can pick some of the
computer books that I have
here that I'm trying to get rid of
so links in the show notes
Speaking of HPR promotion
they guys
over on Linux again
they repurposed
the Tom Merch episode
that Corbucci did
as a Christmas break
episode
Phoenix also
interviewed me
for the first episode
of his new podcast
Phoenix Tech Weekly
and I'd also like to
thank Dan
who's been
very very helpful
and we got some people
to come back to us from that
I'd also like to thank
the Linux Outlaws
who give us a big plug on
episode 187
which has seen some people come over to the show
and also
has raised another topic
which I might be able to address next month
hopefully
I'd like to thank Jonathan
and for your information
Pokey has gone ahead and ordered the HPR stickers
and thank to
Krold Cruncher
aka Maya
who came to our rescue again
she uploaded all the shows
for archive.org last month
and this month she was on hand
to redesign the logo
so that it would be acceptable
to the printers
so that was
cool
very very cool
speaking of very cool
we have
murs now available at archive.org
and they addresses
archive.org
forward slash details
forward slash hacker
public radio
and Jason Scott's
tixfiles.com has us
at audio.tixfiles.com
forward slash shows
forward slash HPR
to our sponsor
kerr.net
was working on the website
for some reason
flash
I can't get links to work
and flash
as I don't like flash
I replaced one of their
animated gifts
spores and team have signed up
for a
nameless infosec podcast
on the first Monday
stankels on to tell us
that they already
running there is already an
in-ice-cast server
running on the HPR's
server so we can stream
HPR shows from there
and I'm waiting for him to get
back to me on with more
information and how to do that
the an-erabi of it
links us to some
banners for scale 9
which is going to be
2011
and if you have
promotions or banners
why don't you send them along
and we'll add them to the site
feel free also
to add promos to your own
shows and if somebody wants
to do a promo show here
on HPR once a month
or once every two months
taking a look at what's coming up
on the Linux scene
or the hackers scene
shows and places to be
announced and stuff like that
free of free to do so
I haven't yet found a way
to automate the upload
starcare.org and if somebody
wants to investigate
that I would seriously
appreciate it
we are getting
hot and heavy with the old
social networks
this month we've set up a
Facebook group
and you'll find a hot link
at hackerpublicradio.org
for Facebook
I can't find a way
to automatically add everybody
but anybody can join
just invite there
anybody wants to be
admin give me a shout
and I'll turn you into
admin for the group
and we also have a LinkedIn
group for the people with
suits and ties
you can get to it at
iTunes page
at hackerpublicradio.org
for it's that iTunes will
zoom you over there
well that's pretty much
all the news for this month
I'd like to thank everybody
who's contributed to it
it's the more people
are contributing
the more it's taking up
of my time but it's
it's very rewarding at the same time
and now
we've been
approving all the spam
and you can
even tell now that they
are realizing this
and have reacted
as follows
doctors in Los Angeles rights
to say
it is the best strategy
because this page was really
spammed thanks very much
we have Sharavan
