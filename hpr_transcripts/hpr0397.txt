I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Hacker Public Radio. In case you don't
recognize my voice because it's been a while this is Stankdog and I'm very excited to record
another episode with you today because I have a great event that I want to talk about
and we have the organizer of that event and I don't know if I'm going too far here.
Founder started the whole Nurtipalooza festival if you will. Hex on the phone.
Did I go too far with that? Oh that's perfect. Hi everyone, Hex. Welcome to the show Hex.
I came out yesterday here in 2007. I had the idea for Nurtipalooza and I came up with it.
I'm running with it soon. Okay now I went to Nurtipalooza 08 and that was referred to as Nurtipalooza
or SE which takes place here in Orlando, Florida, Central Florida area but it actually started.
You say in 2007 was the very first one? March in 2007 was when I first had the idea.
The first Nurtipalooza took place on 2007 in Deanville, Florida and that was Nurtipalooza
Southeast and then I had my own Nurtipalooza in California and that was called Nurtipalooza Beta
and that had a, all of those were kind of small that they were really tentable about one day show.
Okay. The following year 2008 there was in the last week in June was Nurtipalooza UK
which also was just a small show but Nurtipalooza Southeast 2008 wanted to do a weekend which we
call the Nurtipendent Show. We had attendance of 300 people, we raised $2,000 for charity,
we had 30 artists from all over the place including a British and a Canadian artist and it was a
roasting success. Yeah and then your Canadian artist, I spent a lot of time with him at the last one
and he is just hilarious, he is so fun to hang around with too. We're going to talk about
quite a few of these people that are going to be performing this weekend and have performed in
the past. He's actually not making it, we're talking about Wordburgler. That's Greg Wordburgler
was unable to make it this year out of her strong talks with them and he's interested in coming
out for 2010 so there's always a possibility of the return of the Wordburg. Well it's you know
it's a long trip from Nova Scotia so I, we can understand the logistics behind that one. However
there are a lot of new acts coming to this one as well but let's back up again now. Again you
came up with the idea and everything but it's more than, it's more, well actually there's so many
things I want to say here I'm not sure where to start. First of all Central Florida, not just
Orlando but across Tampa, Central Florida, seems to me to be kind of a nerd core hub if you will,
kind of the, I don't know the capital of nerd core, I don't know this, there is a lot of activity
and a lot of groups and performers and artists, nerd core artists in this area.
Well more than just nerd courts, nerd music and it's surprising to find, because when I first heard
about nerd core hip-hop and certain kinds of research on it, I was also surprised to see the
central nature of how many artists, how many nerd core hip-hop artists there were in
Orlando and Florida itself, there's Captain Ann and the scary crew, that's Pirates,
that's Condra crew, the rapping ninjas, we got Maddie Tech, we got emergency feet to party
way, rocket propelled geese for the funky 49, all this in the Central area where
normally nerd core has problems because it's a internet run phenomenon and so fans and artists
are scattered throughout while they support each other musically and ideologically they can't do
it physically, might go into each other's shows and actually like contributing their own fans
because for every artist they're going to have their own fans that are based off of their
friends and then their friends introduce them to introduce their music to other people that
tell they build a fan base and so when all these different artists come together and collaborate,
that's when a bigger fan base can be built and so that's what we had in Orlando before we came
out here and once they came out here and noticed that nerds, this phenomenon didn't stop with
just nerd core hip hop, there's also chiptune which is in the techno that's all over the place
you know in Florida as well, most prominently Jake Thornton who will be performing in
Nerdopluza for the first time recently a little bit ago releases album called Epidemic which is a
landmark concept album using chiptune's the kind of like Nintendo sounding music for a zombie
concept album and then we have speaking his own concept bands like killer robots or a zombie's
organization down in Southern Florida we have all these different bands all over the place
but still sexually located for swanaries or never in Florida, I know it's just like a hot spot
here there's so much available I was even I was down at Universal Studios this weekend down at City
and they have a stage out there where people perform and they actually had a nerd core act out there
they had a group called nerd ranger now I don't know if they're local to central Florida but they
were on the stage in the center of city walk performing and that's great to see.
Nerd ranger had actually just approached this recently about possibly before we in Nerdopluza
a little too late for in 2009 but we were gonna start talking about working with them on some
level based in Orlando. See that it that's great that they're getting stage down in you know
a hot spot area like Universal Studios there were a lot of people listening and a lot of people
there that are probably being exposed to this stuff that never would have heard of it I mean it's
I don't want to say mainstream or anything but it's actually getting some respect I think is a
better way to word it. Right some respect a momentum. And that's a great thing to see and I think
Nerdopluza has helped that a lot getting an organized event like this together I know takes a lot
of work so definitely personally I can tell you I appreciate it I know what goes behind it
but what a lot of people might not realize that this is not some big for profit thing that you're
trying to make money and turn all this this is actually a charity event can you talk about that
a little bit. Yeah like I mentioned before last year we raised $2,000 for charity which is
called Childs Play it's for those better from my or Penny Arcade though webcomic found at pennyhytearket.com
once this charity called Childs Play which you can find information about at ChildsPlayCharity.org
which is basically charity where they raise money for children's hospitals around the world they
raise money through it by video games and books and more games and stuff thenals and all the stuff
and it's the the give them all over the US the Europe even children's hospitals in in Egypt it's
it's a worldwide phenomenon of them helping children and it's kind of all the way their motto is
it's gamers giving back it's it's kind of turned for some people into the de facto nerd charity
it's one charity from Nerdster Valley behind because if there's one thing nerds kind of connect with
it's the first thing curiosity of a child and wanting to foster their curiosity or seeing a child
in pain like with Childs Play Childs Play supports is something that nerds have no problem with going
this is something that we can universally rally behind. Yeah and you know what I mean to give a child
a game and going through some of the things that they have to go through it is just such an admirable
cause that I'm so glad to see the support that it's getting so I definitely wanted to make sure we
give them a plug the website for that again is a child's play charity.org everybody go check that
out regardless of whether you're going to be able to make it to nerd up a loser or not however
we do want them to come to nerd up a loser it is this weekend that would be July 11th 12th well
actually isn't there an event Friday night right? There is with those that are sitting on the
fence whether or not they'd like to go to church or not a loser or not don't know if they they
really are interested committing whole weekend there is the chance to find out first and whether
or not this is the kind of event you'd like to go to the night before at a local comic shop
are one of our biggest sponsors called a comic shop located on the corner of Semran
36 and university is hosting our second annual pre-party at this pre-party they will be offering
free beer for those of age as well as free pizza and there's no entry whatsoever now we're going
to have six artists this year including Jaital and that I've mentioned a couple of other nerd
artists Confucius and thinking her hurts from Q49 and as well as Shaper the Darkboard from New York
he is a phenomenal artist who is cool with the showstopper last year so we thought it would be best
to have him act as the artist to try to pretty much put on a show that will make people
the intro for the following day at the pre-party people will be able to purchase tickets and for
the for the whole weekend July 11th and 12th it will be only 20 dollars 15 dollars if you want
to go just either day but do a little bit of the option if you go Saturday and realize this is
the amazing day I need to come back you can show them that you purchase a one show us that you
purchase a one day ticket and give us a list of five dollars for an upgrade oh well that's
you see now that's a nice thing too because somebody might think they're not going to make it
Sunday because of work or another commitment and if they do they don't have to pay the other 15
they can add five on to it that's correct now see that see that's just a nice
friendly thing to do most people wouldn't do the act and you know what Sunday we're not in it
to make money we're trying to support child plays by just possible but one of the peniments
of Nurtipus itself is ensuring that it is affordable it's something that people will not have to
break the bank in order to enjoy right and and both days let me say there's no day that's
both days are packed absolutely packed this is a festival starting at noon each day correct and
going through until whenever whenever people decide to wrap up MC front a lot closes Saturday night
at 10 45 and we'll go on as long as his set goes and as long as people hang around
that's one of the things and I'm sorry Sunday night the headliner is going to be MC Chris who's
new to Nurtipus so that's going to be a new artist that I'm looking forward to seeing
same thing though as last year one of the things that I thought was so cool was that everybody was
so friendly and accommodating there was no intimidation if anybody is hesitating to come
because you're worried about I'm a nerd am I going to fit in or I'm too geeky for this or any
it just any kind of hesitation you may have I go into an event like this and I think I'm not sure
what to expect so I kind of go in with a little bit of guard up and I got to say that I was welcome
and treated so well by everybody performers the artist there we're hanging around in the crowd you
can talk to them they're not they're not full of ego and standoff as they were all very friendly
we were standing up front for hours zealous wine and hormones and I was dropping some beats we
were just freestyle and up front for just hours taking turns freestyling around a circle I
was a freestyling because well that's not my thing but it was just great being a part of the whole
thing hanging out laughing making jokes it was just a whole wonderful experience where everybody
was welcome nobody was excluded and that is something that's hard to find anywhere in the world
these days yeah it's it's it's really phenomenal how there wasn't an atmosphere any of us had
planned to build that we were built and we were shocked or so the organizers were shocked when
we saw even as early as the pre-party the pre-party were where it was the headliner for that for
the pre-party he was there wrap up the storm and out of nowhere bubble up and chaffer and all the
other artists they show up and they're just sitting there and then watching and enjoying the show
just as if there were anyone else yeah that kind of attitude of I'm here to support the
heaven of my fellow artists and just as the fans are here to support them it's this kind of
mentality that there was not anticipated a precedent what definitely shows this kind of camaraderie
that is that is what something can now someone can now expect that they're the poliza right it would
I mean they definitely you check your ego at the door everybody in there is part of a
and I this sounds really corny I guess but a brotherhood of nerd core I'm not sure if that sounds
too weird but it really well excuse me actually I'm gonna I'm gonna step back and say a brotherhood
and sisterhood of nerd core I'm gonna be politically correct there because there were a lot of
different people there and all of us are quite frankly nerds in some way or form were all
kind of think differently than the mainstream music the mainstream pop the main for extreme
content so it was kind of a group of people that get you and that you can get and that you can
get along with so that was a very cool environment for the whole thing now this is all for charity
and that's all well and good but you also have had a lot of help from sponsors you mentioned one
earlier a comic shop out in winter park right that's correct though comic shop based on
our park found out just turned around for I weigh 40 36 and they're one of our big sponsors they're
helping us advertise on Facebook they're helping us coordinate the pre-party to open fire they're
actually the people that are bringing us one of our headliners MC Chris they're pretty much
paying for him to come out all out of their own pocket wow that's very cool definitely go check
them out if you're in central florida let's talk about a couple of the other headliners here
Friday night you're already mentioned shave for the dark lord that guy's intense so there's
your sample come out Friday see if you can see if you can keep up with that guy and some of
these other some of these other performers are gonna be there they'll give you a good taste
of what you can expect Saturday night
three headliners are are the like with Chris MC for a lot and he's got to be making his first
appearance as well as returning it's gonna be a whitey cracker but um and all those guys are
are the nerd core hip-hop persuasion but our another headliner that I really want to spotlight
is the proto-men who for those that are familiar are this uh video game concept man where they don't
make video game music but video game inspired music because they make pretty much your rock opera
inspired on the mega man franchise and where else what other music concert are you going to hear
something that cool really where else are you going to get that only at nerd applause and you know
I'll tell you this I'll be honest last year I learned of a whole new sub genre if you will
called wizard rock I had never heard of it until nerdy polluza you introduced me to that
and uh we'll be featuring some uh some wizard rock some local wizard rock once again house of
black will be returning and they'll be bringing there a good friend's fiddly which is a very
comedic approach to the wizard rock uh genre that he is freaking amazing and explain to the listeners
what wizard rock is because I just learned it myself last year well wizard rock for those that
are unfamiliar is pretty much music inspired by Harry Potter it's music surrounding the characters
and the events and what not some of it is a trend from the realm's fan fiction film
only the realms of stealth where they're the kind of uh making parody music are around Harry Potter
but it's all attributed to the uh JK Rowling series so so let's let me let me get this
straight I'm counting on my fingers here which they can't see on the radio but we have
wizard rock Harry Potter themed music we have pirates we have ninjas we have
nerdcore hip hop yeah we have video game inspired music it's not all see a lot of people think
nerdcore mostly of hip hop I guess is the largest genre or sub genre of nerdcore nerdcore hip hop
and there are quite a few acts really good acts there my friend uh in 80 dual core are going to be
there sunday looking forward to hanging out with them again zealous one was awesome uh last year
I'm looking forward to seeing him again um MC Chris probably everybody's listening to this is
probably heard of MC Chris uh MC front lot MC Lars I'm looking forward to seeing for the first time
whitey cracker again he was here last year we all went out and ate at the the pub down the street
from the last venue which was very cool um my gosh I don't know what other nerd topic is not
covered here I mean you've got computers in Harry Potter and wizardry and ninjas and pirates
what else robots we had killer robots last year what what what what don't we have
yeah yeah yeah that's the whole point it's this giant the giant celebration this giant
of monstrous tornado of nerd culture that is just the whole weekend that is hopefully too good
to pass up on yeah I know it is for me I'm definitely looking forward to being there um you'll be
introduced to a lot of different genres and a lot of different types we want everybody to stay
and watch all of the acts be exposed to new things but if somebody has to leave and come back or
can only be on there for a day or two it's open once you buy your ticket you can come and go you
may come for a few hours if you have to work and come back for the headliners a night is that okay
yeah that's definitely okay everyone gets a wristband and uh once they have the wristband it is
better as their key to get in and out excellent excellent um all right well listen I I can't wait
myself I'm already looking forward to it um looking forward to meeting up and hanging out with
MC front a lot um some of the other guys there see if I can drop some bead stool a little freestyle
I'm not sure how the new venue is going to handle the freestyle we might have to take that outside
or something we'll we'll kind of wing that and see how it goes but that's kind of the way this is
too it's not too formal we're going to get there it's also different where we're going to have a
dedicated vendor room where our sponsors will be able to advertise their wares but
there we're also going to have a video game station awesome where if four wonders and another
song someone is a big rocked too hard and they can't take any more music they can go take a break
do some BDR or some Marvel versus Capcom too just relax for a little bit very cool any other
sponsors are going to be some people setting out sponsor booths anybody else you want to mention
before we close up oh yeah first off we have our our comments and arms the artists of a group
that we was so much more than anyone else ample records they are the backbone to nervous they
are what made to nervous the 2008 happened there what's making 2009 happened check them out at
ampolesfreckers.com the one of the best nerd core hip hop record labels out there other sponsors we
have include deep tube productions which is this local online movie production company but they
just make online movies and it's there are a lot of fun there will also be having bigger sponsors
like vitamin water and balls energy drinks come to Nerfosa giving us some beverages for everyone to
enjoy we got local networking sites like nerd core network as well as live trance.org which are
strong advocates and supporters of Nerfosa a local press company enemy ink are supporters of
Nerfosa and they give us a discount on our amazing t-shirts which will be available at the event
I'm trying to think what else we have pause them pause a motion is a local
training company set of Daytona and nerd core for life the documentary about nerd core hip hop is
also a sponsored nerd place I think that's about it if I missed anyone I know my sponsors will
get on me later but you can all check it out at Nerfosafest.com I was getting ready to say I just
realized as you were reading some of those off and brainstorming the sponsors there we haven't
mentioned the website. Nerdopoluzoffest f-e-s-t as infestible. Nerdopoluzoffest.com you can see the
schedule of who goes on what time the lineup and everything news speaking of movies that nice little
trailer that little video you have on there with the ninja that was pretty funny I was laughing at
that earlier that was good stuff I won't mention some of the things that were laying around your
house I mean that person's house but let's say I think we've covered just about everything I
don't want to I'm trying to think is there anything else that somebody who's never been would
need to know about this again not intimidating show up hang out I tell you what I'll put myself
out there if anybody wants to come and what needs a friend or needs somebody to talk to or just
get started with so you don't have to stand in the corner you probably won't have to anyway because
people are friendly I mean I had never met Benjamin Bear fanatical there were just people that I
just met I actually didn't even know who they were we were just hanging out talking and then I'm
like oh really you're in that's you oh I love this song and I mean you're probably gonna have no
problems fitting in but if you want somebody to start with come find me I'll be wearing my bin
rev shirt probably I don't know you guys will find me somehow I'm sure and I'll be glad to hang
around introduce people that kind of thing come to nerd up a loser make it if you can if you're
in central Florida or anywhere in Florida you have no reason not to just make a drive up Friday when
