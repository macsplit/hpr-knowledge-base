Hi, this is Forky once more.
I did a great big blunder in show number 2642.
I wasn't striving a show called Heared Sunt and I was too writing it in the podcast
notes but that's not all Heared Sunt.
Heared Sunt was a children radio show about scientific discoveries that are nearly unseen
and my voice really liked it but now it's gone.
The show I really was describing is qualifier had hemliked or qualified secret and I will
give you the right address in the show notes to this year.
So I apologize and I'm hoping next time I will do better.
