Now you're welcome to this week we're going to excel for many years and good today is Thursday
October 2nd, 2008, hello!
How are we doing? Good, good. Is anybody around here?
I can't make your question. You're doing right now?
Good, good, good.
Okay, so do we do anything fun? Last week?
Wow, it's not everybody. I don't have time to eat.
Yeah, I got in my X-turn again.
X-turn is remote control of your home appliances and stuff.
And so I had my laptop with a Bluetooth on it that was doing my SSH through and doing my
laptop. Think, but the whole year is the X-10 software.
And now I can sit right here, I can just type in the command and turn my lights on at my own.
That's so cheesy, dude. I wanted to do those costs.
The X-10 modules, you can get a starter kit for around 50 bucks that will include your remote control,
like two plug-in outlets and a lamp module.
And so you basically control extra things.
And each, for example, a lamp module that only controls the incandescent lights,
that's probably about 13 bucks.
No, they don't worry anymore.
They carried it for probably about a month and then it sort of disappeared.
There's an X-10 website and you'll see it mostly with security cameras,
X-10 component things and there's a couple other places that sell them too.
But I've had these for a while and all my lights come on again.
Like they used to where they come on at dusk and they go off like at 11.30.
And you can like, it says, remotes that I can walk up the stairs and turn the sequence of lights on.
And that's so cheesy.
Yeah, it is. And then now that I got on the laptop, it also walks.
Everything that goes on. So any devices that are controlled, like if some of those lights
or something like that, it walks up. So I can tell when things turn down, when things turn down.
I've got motion detectors, they'll tell when the lights turn down.
You have motion detectors, so the lights will turn on.
Yep, yep. Well, actually I got one that turns down like off stairs.
So you're coming home, I walk through the garage, it'll detect my light,
motion and then it'll turn on the lights and then they turn off after about three minutes,
because then I'm already upstairs.
Yeah, so I got a record.
But it's sort of nice now.
Because also the same kit comes with the remote control wireless antenna thing.
That thing also stores the stuff.
So any macros or things that you built are stored in this module.
You can turn off the PC and walk away and just let it run from that point on.
I'll just continue to run.
So I was sort of looking at that and the only bad thing about it is the bandwidth is
or when it's not in the bandwidth for speed to these devices.
Yeah, it's very slow.
Anything in set for turn devices on?
Yeah, there's no real time type thing in there.
The bandwidth was about 20 bits per second.
Yeah, it is. And when I hit it, there's like a maybe a half a second to a second delay
before that will go on.
The bad part about X10 is for most X10 stuff, there's no acknowledgement that they actually activity happen.
So that's the other bad port.
They have a new standard out.
Forget what it's called.
Instian works like wireless repeater network.
So every device will repeat through your house.
You can send a signal.
It runs off of the power.
You can send a signal.
And if that device gets it, it will repeat it in the net device.
And so the more devices you have, the more accurate and the faster things you're at.
Except the only problem with that is those modules are about twice as much.
That's all right.
Twenty six.
Twenty six is the lowest amount.
Time for additional.
Yeah, I don't want to afford it.
I like switch for 30 bucks now.
I was actually looking at the semantics for those.
Trying to figure out exactly how they work.
And what it is is, you know, the AC wave in between every time it gets the zero point.
It's the zero point.
It either has it adds a high frequency wave or it doesn't add a high frequency wave.
And then what it'll do is for every point, it'll be high frequency wave.
Or no high frequency wave.
So that's kind of your one zero.
It works.
Okay, you know, it works decent once you get it set up right and stuff like that.
But I'm sure that instant stuff is much better stuff.
You can do full, you can do full dimming and seeing capabilities and stuff like that.
You can deal with this thing too.
It's cool now that you hooked up to my laptop and I can log the stuff and control it.
And I don't have to use those.
Don't have, don't have, well, I actually do have an external camera though.
And I'm truck up.
Except it doesn't run into the laptop that I have on all the time.
It's on the USB 1 and my old laptop.
So what I was looking at it for was some sort of getting in the monitor and everything.
And then having to control the computer service.
They were supposed to have some temperature modules and stuff like that.
They were supposed to have a new documentation.
And they showed all the temperature stuff.
Would have had to have actually every room on different zone.
Temperatures on?
Not necessarily depending on what you want to do.
Yeah, you could average your temperatures or...
For instance, if you have a multi-level house.
And it's, you know, 30 degrees colder in the basement than it is upstairs.
You don't want to turn me easy.
And you just want to circulate the air.
You turn a banner.
If it starts getting warmer, then you want to turn me AC out.
If it's colder outside, well, you don't want to turn me easy.
I don't even know what's high.
So you open the window?
You can't.
They've got shape-ballers.
You can hook them up to open your curtains automatically.
I was looking at a very haxy and article the other day of work.
You can take the stepper motors out of your old floppy drives.
And you can use that to power them.
And if you...
A lot of your talking motors?
Oh, yeah, for spinning.
You have to step on those things.
You can control very precisely.
And they were talking about possibly doing something with like the Arduino.
Okay.
That's what you're looking at, Chip.
Do you have a Arduino controller or something?
Well, there's a little mini...
You can get those now with the networking port.
They're easily coded.
So you can make use of it.
Using a wood?
It's a micro controller.
But I mean, you can run the stepper motor straight, almost straight off the bottom.
Actually, yeah, they had a...
They had a basic response for controlling the stepper motor.
It's not very hard at all.
I mean, you can use it in software if you want.
Instead of having this, you can go through and do it.
I can actually run the stepper motor.
I don't know.
I know.
Interesting.
So you could use...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Yeah.
They do.
Because you also have the RF remote control, too, that you can interface with it and stuff.
And they do have X-Tem built-in.
It's getting to be an older protocol.
Not as supported, but the HE program is so simple and...
There's really hardly any compiling to do to get into any installation.
It's fairly easy to do on it.
It just has to work through serial port.
That's the harvest part.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
It will control one.
That's like a USB to serial download.
So that's how it works with that.
So you turn off the purple lines and stuff.
And then it works through the USB.
Yeah, she's...
I heard that.
Oh, I wiped out my EPC and put it in the trepid version on there.
It seems to be working snappier.
Living on the edge.
Living on the edge, okay.
I got burned glass time.
It's been working really well.
It feels snappier than the old OAS.
I'm going to wait for a time.
A bit over.
30 more days.
Cool.
Well, do I get to see you again?
Yep.
Back.
That's great.
I'm going to wait for you, President.
No, it's not for freedom, but you would be there to think that the CV is there.
I wouldn't take it.
Yeah, I was actually at a funeral very nice time.
Oh, sorry about that.
Well, things happen.
Yeah.
Who?
Oh, do you have any?
Try to resurrect an old PC I have.
It didn't get very far.
It just...
I don't know what I'm going on with it.
You turn the board on, and all the lights just stay on.
And it doesn't even focus.
Give us a hint.
It looks like in my head.
No, the lights on.
Nobody knows what you're saying.
She's a teacher.
She's a teacher.
She's a teacher.
She's a teacher.
That was a good idea for me.
I've been pretty busy this week this school.
She said, nope.
Everything is going okay in school.
You know how to minimize the need for like server,
or on multiple servers and all.
It can work even in environment.
Yeah.
We're outing different network services to all of the servers.
Cool.
That's something what I do not understand.
I don't know.
Anyway.
That was actually pretty exciting.
I didn't know very well.
Yeah.
Well, it's pretty easy.
Where are they?
In the middle?
Yeah, they're hopefully on.
They can do a lot of school and radio communication.
But they try to get into more network type applications.
They're on wireless networking.
They're even thinking about motor rules coming out with the new wireless WAN type service.
I think if I understood the correct thing, you want to start out in a player or something like their wire.
And they actually asked me if I felt comfortable going down the hill and training
on this new application that they're going back to be their lead person in their ride.
You know what I would like?
Nice opportunity.
Bye.
Okay.
So how do they feel competing with a clear ride?
I didn't really get in that way.
I don't think so.
I, well, I just wanted to, I just think that it's got a tough business to be in.
I'm sure it is.
I don't know, I'm not even sure I understood what they were talking about exactly.
You will.
You will.
It doesn't matter if they get to your paycheck.
Yeah.
Remember that.
That's what matters.
Yeah.
You just pop up through and it might work and if it doesn't work, it's called technical
support.
Oh, it's supposed to be you.
Why not?
Oh, I can fix everything.
I'll have Mr. Recorder.
What's the word this week?
What do you want to make for that?
Playing with Fedora 10.
You know what I'm saying?
How is that?
I'm trying to get used to that account, I don't know.
They used to be hard to get used to it, but you don't like that.
It's a business sort of movie like or maybe that's all clear.
It's a clear question.
Oh, right.
I don't like it.
On some point, I kind of like it, but the other time it just looks good.
Cheesy.
Cheesy.
Childish?
That's why I think it's like.
Overall, that looks good.
Playing with the new version of Nautilus with my tab.
How do you like that?
I like it.
I like it.
Oh, the takeman for a while?
I'll just do the tab, browser.
Yeah.
I know, it's a pretty good implementation of it.
Looking forward to that and intrepid as well.
So you don't care about spatial feature?
No, Nautilus.
That's your thing to turn on.
It's a stature.
That's when you go from one jerk to two and out and direct create that.
It's whenever I know it.
Oh god.
Oh god, I hate that.
Still default for the retail store.
I think that's one thing I do like about the door is you don't have all these custom integrations
For the most part, they take no one when they take the door and
They're all KDE, but the custom integrations with custom integrations are cool
Yeah, it's like a layer of like, yes, or what?
But it's nice polish, that's all good
It's like, yes, because a nice polish there
Yep, and after some system
Yes, I was in a room
You come to my shop, nice and polished
And I go through with my fake cast iron metal truck
Well, the only difference is that you will have to make it
But you know, should there be a cast iron toy car?
Anyway, so, yeah, I played with an intrepid of it too, but I don't know
Trying to like KDE again
And the AC clunky, so
And then, what else do I show you then?
I'm off eating
Did you put it in the newsletter next week?
Yeah, don't talk about it
But the secret right now is the work
Oh, yeah, all right
What was the word?
It was a secret
Amahi AMAH
Oh, I cannot go there
You might as well
So the jig is out
That's all I have to talk about
It's my only card
You don't have to talk about the same thing next week
But it's something
It's the best one
Oh, he's installing his operating system from it
So here is your Amahi
It's based on Fedora 8
And they've got their own customer positive where you look at it
It basically sets up for you a DHCP server
DPN, dynamic DNS
And they get a bunch of other apps
You can do a quick point click install
So I'll help you
You do a basic
Bear bones Fedora 8 install
And then you
You put their repositories in it
And then you run their install script
And you've got it
You can sign up on their website with an account
And that's kind of where you enter in
What domain name you want
The wizard you walk through
They give you a code at the end of your
Wizard on the website that you enter in
On the command on your PC to start up
Search your stuff
Maybe that's what you should have on a hard drive
Yes, you've got indexed your stuff
They've got calendar integration here
And all of the stuff
Anything that sets up the server for you
With all the features
That people generally ask for
Try to put it in any way
Most of the stuff I've played with before
The app here and app there
They usually take me a week to figure them out
Does this actually act as the router
Or is it just a server that's the router too
It's the DHCP server
The DNF
So you don't have to have a powerful router at home
So all I did at home was I had to turn off the DHCP server
And then this took its place instantly
Without any problems
I didn't have
Yes, they didn't have instructions on how to turn the DHCP off
You unplugged the server
You see the server
How come wireless?
It's a plug server too
But yeah, I stumbled upon this looking at a...
I used to play with some called pba
Personal backup assistant
And it's a virtual machine
That you can image your hard drives over the network
And restore them and whatnot
But the guy who runs that
I noticed in one of this form policy
You're referring to this
It's all web interface
Yep, it gives you a web interface to access your
You can do user account management
Through the web interface on the server
What does it create?
You tell if the domain you want to use
The domain you want to use on the server
That sounds strange
But no, it's an actual...
Honestly, God, don't mean
Like what type of like LDAP?
You have to find a little protocol to use it
I don't know if that means for authentication
Yeah, this is open
LDAP is like a...
Keep going down once
That's the closest lens comes
So it don't mean like structure
It's like LDAP
Keep going down
Not that
How do you...
How do you log in to...
When you open up a browser
Is it something like when you open a browser
It defaults to a GBA
Is the name of the machine
I mean, I'm using a Windows domain
How do you log in from a workstation?
To the web interface
To the web interface
Well, you can share files
So you can share files
How would a client access the server
From the side of your home?
No, from what end
But this is a server that's got all your files on
But you've got other...
They set up a Samba share
How does it log into the domain?
Okay
The domain is set up
And it's a...
It'll just show up up as a network
You know, like they're showing that
I set up one on the web
And I picked the domain name that I wanted to use
So I picked Adam and Reid.Net
And when this is set up
And started up the DHCP
Every machine on my home network
Showed up on my router
As where the machine lane was
Dot Adam Reid.Net
So it was an honesty guide
That set up an actual domain
I've never been able to find that
But it's just something about the domain
And it's DNS
And probably we can
You can actually set it up
With your actual domain
You can probably use that
Because you do have
Technically, you do have a domain name
Or a touch for your public ID
For instance
You're not going to have to try that one
But there are some, they acknowledge that it's very beta, yeah, and there were, I had some
problems with some of the apps that can get to work for A, but I've got it installed
in a virtual machine, which was another, I wasn't sure it was going to work, because actually
with the machine it was running in was getting its IP, I don't know, from the virtual machine
that was costing it up, it worked, I don't know, it's kind of going to be chickened off
from everything, but on a network, if you have rich networking, it's an out of computer.
So for network, it's out of physical network, thank you, I wasn't sure it was going to
work, but it did, so cool.
Okay, let's get out of it, because it's secret right now, that's right, there we go,
you have fun something else.
Okay, I'll minimize.
Okay.
Okay.
You have to go on the first level and that works out, so pretty much anything you've requested
through a new person, or anything that you requested, the requested directly, you're
going to be on it.
I trust you.
Okay.
Where are you running this?
I don't know.
I brought it through.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This makes my network a first-class network, the H&B you're pressing in, so I'm actually
going to be on it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm still thinking of training out of it.
I'm always flirting with Fedora.
But you know, it's okay.
It's okay. We don't take it against you.
It's actually this side of the table.
That side of the table, I feel.
It's really true.
That's right.
I think it's been using my Erika backup stuff quite a bit lately.
And everything is running okay?
I actually went through and kind of redid my backup repositories more based on their tutorial and guides.
It's a bit complicated.
Do you think that at some point you could actually do tutorial for us?
From the Erika stuff?
Yes.
Actually, so.
I suppose you suppose.
I'll just find a tutorial on my website.
Hey.
We all want to read it.
All what we want is you would tell us.
If people are interested, yeah.
I think it would be interesting.
I think for how easy it is to install and use,
it's probably the most future fold backup.
File backup system life.
Is that a simple backup?
Yeah.
Well, the simple backup thing requires that you know a little bit about the scheduler on this.
This one is not.
Do you love to do it by yourself?
It was the simple backup was.
Was it Python?
It wasn't.
As long as it wasn't mono, I probably didn't know what you guessed.
It was like simple backup.
I don't think they'd run on windows or anything.
I got mad at simple backup.
Because when I upgraded this frozen one point with a version of simple backup,
it changed and it couldn't open up the folder backup files.
That's sort of important.
When it comes to having to restore and you can't restore it.
I would need to restore your backup for it.
Of course not.
No, why would I need it?
I can't.
Something was missing.
I think it's because it's a job as well.
A job?
You run it any time.
You run it like Andrew.
I think you're not.
Let's see if I can run it any time.
I thought it was a job.
I don't know.
It needs to be like Python.
Python and maybe Perl.
You're like Perl.
It's not very short.
Perl is in.
You can believe.
What?
Perl is in.
Yes.
It's not in.
It's not bad.
It's not good.
You can do a good step with it.
It's not good.
It's not good.
Absolutely.
Because you're going to beat it.
You're right.
And then you forget what it is.
The other toy percent are old days.
They can touch up.
Python is just a little bit more familiar with that.
It has a lot to do with it.
Is there any?
Well, I think that I knew a person with little issues with access and handling.
It's not in Python.
It's not in Python.
It's like a...
It's a kosher.
Yeah, it doesn't say anything, but it doesn't do it.
It's a campaign.
It's a campaign.
Yes.
The Senate.
Why do you have two Senate?
Not handling.
I like things that you know, scream and roll up.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
You can get two.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't.
If you have a strike, this is a strong type of language, it'll yell at you when you compile.
You know, that's a first line of defense.
There's so many million people in this world.
It might not be as pretty, you know, when you're writing it, but you know exactly what it's going on.
It's typical.
Yeah.
People want to hear this thing.
There's a lot of things going on in this world.
Otherwise, you don't do the choke line.
It's a bit of a twist.
But it's okay.
You know, it's...
Let's stop there.
Because we have some vendors and they just compile, compile, it's yours, and it's just...
What did they come right now with?
Somebody wrote their own custom format or class for a month.
And if the month was bigger than 10, they have one to it.
And that's why I'm going to start on October 1st.
Instead of using four-marie class, they hold their own custom class, which was crap.
I put a mask on a date when you could go through some convoluted if L's case statement to add zeros on it, right?
Well, yeah.
You know, you show that you have a programmer if you can use L's and elephant keys.
Cast it to a char.
You can try to put it in general.
See?
And that's what it's supposed to look like now.
Wait, the government char is me now.
I'm thinking of something else.
Just hope that you'll never hit October.
There you go.
And then you move your program to Venus.
Because it has only 10 months of life.
I don't know where I'm going to help.
Yeah.
You can't do it.
Why would you?
Because you have different states.
You know, friends.
Never mind.
It was a rent.
So, how's this mistrust?
Trot trot.
It's a big guy.
Pretty good?
Any any patient.
How many patients do you poke?
Today, only one.
Only one.
I do.
Yeah.
It wasn't a main poke today.
It wasn't a poker date.
No.
It comes and goes.
When you work in the big lab, we don't poke.
But I was upstairs in the draw lab.
I don't know.
I don't know.
30 days.
30 days.
I always hit the lead out.
It's somebody's poker date.
Are you a painter?
Yes, I am.
It's always the guy.
It's a joke.
Yeah.
What do you want?
You know?
We have strung.
We have the lead out.
Come together.
You're strung.
Please see the needle.
No need.
You need our blood.
I think money suits you.
There's a lot of good things to do.
I am.
So what did you find?
I signed up for this butterfly.
Let's say you can get pictures printed.
Do you want to have a projector?
No.
You can.
That's not important, Freddie.
Okay.
When I went to try and submit my pictures to be stored online,
it said they had to be in a bad jpeg.
My kid's cool.
So I go online and I have a little thing below.
I find it straight in the name.
It doesn't.
So my picture is wrong.
I didn't.
I tried to try to be a lower piece.
That thing.
I'll make sure for some reason we're in it.
I'll give you a picture.
I think I'm really mad about that.
It's what a fan is programming.
Yeah.
Somebody wrote a custom clause.
It's called the joke.
Yeah.
It says, okay.
And that's I am the end of the regular question check.
Yes.
The end of the issue.
So I went and made up the round.
I found this program.
It was just all my computer.
It's called green.
Yeah.
And what we'll do is it'll go through.
And it was a directory.
It just passed it up.
Pearl.
Aha.
Right.
Expression thing.
It was copy.
And it went through and changed.
I made a date.
That's what you take.
Well, that was not different.
Size of the picture stayed the same.
I did exchange the name.
That's it.
That's it.
This is the cartoon of the hero.
The hero.
Yeah.
The hero.
The keeper.
The same thing.
You can get the middle one.
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
So is it re-name?
Yeah.
That's what it is.
What is your name?
You're just getting it right in the terminal.
What are you getting?
I don't know.
There are both Linux on there.
Yeah.
25%
So you want to get all of it.
And I'm going to share where.
Yeah.
Landsack audio.
Yeah.
And I don't think they see L.
Landsack audio for a little purple girl.
It gives you a smile.
Yeah.
So it came with other programs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
What?
We can feed you remember.
We can feed you remember.
Landsack.
See?
Landsack audio.
Yeah.
Actually.
It was a website.
You could get a toolbar for it too.
Yeah.
It was, it was terrible.
It was terrible rail years.
Yeah.
It was, it was that in the early days of Malibu.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
And I think it used to crash your system all the time too.
But you put it, you could have a nice toolbar you were trying to explore.
Yeah.
For a short time anyways.
Oh, no, it's a native.
Yeah, it stays there.
Or stays there.
Yeah, you just couldn't get rid of it.
And it was really re-format.
Well you know, it gave you edit features like quality of your personal data.
in searching Google, I don't know, like it was Google,
linked through the ones that I, and maybe, you know,
they're not actually trying to create more traffic.
What is?
Let's look this way.
So was it a repository?
It was just already installed.
You should have.
Like, we got to the terminal just type and rename it.
G-P-R-E-N-E.
You probably started having a problem with it.
It's five over here and say, rename it.
How do you like it?
Now.
Okay.
Yup, it works.
It's the terminal.
It's the terminal.
It's the terminal.
It's the terminal.
It's the terminal.
You guys, I drink it up.
It's the terminal.
Well, what is the terminal?
Yup, it is there.
So, should we do this?
Unknown option.
That's definitely.
Tricky.
Main rename.
That would give you an example of all sorts of things.
If somebody wrote a manual through it.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, look at that.
Cool.
See?
That's great.
Your manual is different than mine.
This is more advanced manual.
So, make me a looking at the screen for man pages today.
You've got the program as well.
I got the Linux program of manual.
See?
You got it there.
That's another money.
We're going to his winning right now.
I'm going to take it outside.
Let's go.
Do you drink that beer?
Me?
No.
I think that was delicious.
Was it?
Yeah, it was delicious.
Yes.
It's delicious.
I have another one coming.
That one is going to be much more mellow.
Yeah, that's fine.
Cool.
Where's the bar?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, speaking of.
Did you only want not to start?
Not to start though.
Yes.
Well, I have that, but I would give you that.
Yeah, I'm there to wipe.
Drink.
I just said it's very good.
She said it's a little dark, but they should do it like, especially like the H.
Very good.
But we forget to get a problem.
That's important.
Because that's how I'm measuring people right now.
We'll get it tomorrow.
We'll give them beer.
And if they were to bottom back, then they'll have friends.
They don't drink.
Yeah, we didn't drink it yet.
It's kind of a game.
It's almost dark.
I was a little select and you was a little select.
It has a, that beer has a very, it's a, it's a cool flavor.
How about that?
Good.
It has a lot of taste.
I think this one is more, it's sweeter.
What do you want next time?
Cool.
All right.
How about you, mister?
There's nothing with that excitement playing with lunch.
You want to get the card, don't you?
Windows.
Windows.
Wow.
I, I do doors too.
Sure.
I was writing it through virtual box.
I didn't know it was the beginning.
Programming environment for, this is kind of the weird thing.
Programming environment is only available on Windows.
And it uses the open source, GCC compiler on the back end.
And I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know about the Windows, GCC.
Yeah.
What do you know?
Maybe our GCC for Windows that uses something.
So I guess technically I couldn't find a program yet.
It was a system.
A lot.
That's a lot.
Then I don't get the simulator and all that stuff.
Which is extremely difficult with microcontrollers.
This can't just run the program.
Did you work with Gary?
How about you?
Now with this program.
Usually, I think that was something.
I think the programs are different types of microcontrollers.
Okay.
I've done this before.
I don't know.
Actually, it was going to have that circuit for it.
I don't know.
The circuit for it.
Yes.
It was done.
And that's the thing.
The series number.
I don't know.
The XB.
He wanted something from me.
But I wasn't there.
He wanted something.
He's not there right now.
He's logged in.
See if I get fast.
He was sitting there.
He wanted something.
But he didn't say what he wanted.
But I went home to him.
So when the car is going to be ready.
When we are going to get a ride.
That's the car you are building.
I'm not charging car.
I'm just in charge of the go-go business.
Go-go business.
Who's wealthy?
I'm in charge of car.
I'm just in charge of the go-go business.
I lost.
Gary, unless you feel lost for a minute.
Gary has a welder.
If you want the welder.
Even a nice cool shop.
He's good.
Yeah.
He's pretty much the most interesting shop.
Well, I need to be that friend who would get that.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
You can do it.
I mean, yes.
I mean, yes.
I might need to have some welding.
I have to.
But also.
I'd better answer his question.
I think that's what I'm happy about.
See, that's what it's making me a certain order.
It feels guilty.
But you know, I think that he enjoys writing.
Unless it is accounting software.
It's not that he wouldn't want to.
Yeah.
It's kind of difficult when you business.
You're an established.
Yeah.
So anyway, yeah, I didn't really work too much.
It was just super rainy.
Cool.
Great.
How do you?
Nothing's ever going to be here.
I've been here for years.
I've been here for years.
I've been here for years.
I've been here for years.
I've been here for years.
What's the style you actually inject?
Something fun to be called.
That doesn't equate.
That doesn't equate.
That doesn't equate.
That's the level of efficiency.
You know what I'm talking about?
Okay, when you talk about Apple, that is going to be the newsletter.
Next week.
So this is the secret again.
Okay.
The ones on the label.
Okay.
I know.
I know.

If the story doesn't matter.
Please kiss me please.
I know.
Try again.
Alright?
Why do you have to look at it?
I know.
You won't even notice me.
I know you have to look at it publicly.
I know.
I have to look at it publicly?
I know.
I know that you have to just sing back there.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Oh.
Why not?
I know.
I don't.
Anything else?
It's about it.

What people create must have thought,
was coming out, it was darling of the this week news, and they were saying that it's not
only getting in the town, but it's not going to be, and that's for developers, the Android
is much better platform, so maybe that was part of it, actually, it wasn't really,
when you really think about it, why business would do something, when they don't have
most likely competitive advantage, because otherwise they could do it.
I will never then know that it's going to be friendly to developers.
They're different to be friendly to anybody.
Yeah, they want to control the wall environment.
Which is in some ways, for down that's their bread and butter is making sure
everything absolutely works all the time.
I was supposed to be doing a ginger beer because that has not just a brown bow.
Sorry, I thought they didn't.
I don't think they'd have here anyone.
Yeah, I don't know.
Where you going, that's what I'm wondering.
Now you wanted that.
Sorry to interrupt.
Cool.
What do I do ask you?
I didn't do a lot with the Linux, I grew it out of beer, and I stopped in a small brewery,
in Dallas, Wisconsin.
It was very interesting to write it.
I can grow it, yes.
And owners were very friendly and showed me around.
And it was very cool to actually be there.
So that's all what I did.
And on Sunday we were cleaning houses with the kids and it was enjoyable.
So that's all what I, what I've done.
I thought it was an interesting article today.
What was that?
In TechNet magazine, which is Microsoft.
Microsoft's TechNet is their support magazine basically for people and stuff.
But within the first five pages there is a full page advertised, not an advertisement.
It's just sort of like new software.
And they're saying portable, there's an application that made portable apps.
You put it on a pen drive and you can carry a portable apps open office.
And some of the other open source software was in this.
Why it was in TechNet really blows my mind.
Because usually that is straight, a Microsoft all the way.
It's written by Microsoft, but here was this article on this.
I forget what the thing was called.
It comes up, it sort of like adds it into the Windows menu,
a whole bunch of open source applications.
And this open office was in there and there are a couple other open source.
It just probably said by, you know that.
I don't know.
It was a review on it, it was what it was.
At some point, the Microsoft's in the store.
It's like Microsoft's store.
And at some point, they didn't move to as a download it, download CD.
And that's what it was.
It was talking, hey, here's some, here's how you can carry your applications with you.
Head Thunderbird in there.
Head sorrows in there, some of that.
Did you consider CD stuff like that?
They might have.
They might have.
Cool.
Cool.
Oh, cool.
Wow.
Somebody might have poisoned your copy.
You never know.
Yeah.
With a box.
With a box of water.
With a bouncy body.
Body.
And that is going to be more secure because from Microsoft,
it will ask you, allow the night, maybe.
Wow.
Shall we do the newsletter?
Do you know?
Okay.
Does anybody read a news letter?
Not everybody?
Didn't get to it today.
Hey, I don't have your email address.
If you wanna get a news letter, send me email.
Don't just press because I just call off the office.
These people are so annoying.
I wanna get their email address and I don't wanna tell me.
Yes, if you don't get what he's trying to do here,
he's trying to get your email address
so I can add in his list.
Yeah, he sells all of our stuff and that's all he gives us.
That's what it is actually.
That's what we're able to do software freedom day
and we actually didn't do any money collection.
It was all the money that I earned on selling a virus name.
He didn't get much.
Hey, did he give me $20?
No, you want it?
Yeah, absolutely.
See, oh, come on, you've already broke even.
No, it didn't.
It didn't yet.
You'll break even.
I got 20.
Cool.
And actually, I forgot to send the email on Tuesday.
I did posting.
I forgot to send the email, so I sent it today.
If anybody wants to see it, that's the,
this was actually part of the article,
but that's the portable apps.
It's called portable apps dot, whatever.
Okay.
And it's, and it's got open off.
Yeah, just open office pigeon, thunderbird, sunbird,
firefox, key pass, school player.
And it was in the September issue of tech net.
See, we didn't put a studio on a, on our CD.
That's, that's, that's what it would have been.
Edit, edit.
And the article is called toolbox,
new products for IT pros.
Take your apps with you.
And it was a positive review.
It was saying, hey, if you want to take your stuff with you,
put it on the thumb drive and...
You lost the afternoon, you're going to go from
a portable apps dot com.
Probably.
But it was a pretty good article, it was...
Oh, great.
They're pretty much all open source software.
Is it, is it just, just full windows?
Open, no, portable apps dot com.
Up grid level apps dot com.
Ha ha ha.
It, they don't, you can see anything to see.
Spread thunderbird and thunderfox,
you gotta search all that.
When I found something, I'll find it out and check it therefore.
And of course, because, you know, four of them are not going to be able to check here in
about three people, people of files on the phone, or something like that, so it's better.
See, there's a green pass in the...
There's a follow-up stuff in there.
Thank you.
There's a break.
Again, that's for the very new problem.
Yeah.
It's certainly not going up.
It made sense.
There's just a whole bunch of stuff in there.
But it just seems strange.
Something like that would appear to Microsoft.
Yeah.
I'm not...
Oh, maybe they don't want to sell their office.
They're trying to look friendly.
Yeah.
They're trying to look open for us.
Certainly.
That was the whole...
Even on the icons in Unix.
Which actually it's out now.
Hervista, two buttons.
And server 2008, you can install a Unix sub-system.
It will actually give you a slash...
Like a root.
In the slash bar.
In the slash bar.
In the slash bar.
Wow.
System.
Okay.
That was...
New download.
To that 24 was increased.
It was released.
They say...
Incremental improvement.
Incremental improvement.
Which it's sort of on the statement.
Okay.
Because...
Okay.
Sorry.
Oh.
I'm telling him to wait.
Okay.
Just say whatever you want to say.
Oh, yeah.
Go ahead.
No.
We have to go ahead and do the necessary.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You guys are ahead.
Yeah.
Which is a little bit understatement.
Because no is always incremental improvement.
It's not actually anything larger.
So...
But I think what they added right now.
They said mobile development platform.
So I don't know if they did a framework for it.
So computer with a QT.
When we talk about QT.
It was...
It was troll type.
It was all troll.
It's a...
It got renamed to QTopia.
I think that's what it is.
QTopia.
Technology or something.
Something like that.
It's all...
That's mine.
So...
Is there any somewhere?
Is it?
Not?
Maybe.
I don't know if I've put it there.
It's just QT in the program.
QT accidentally.
Not here it is.
Protect to QTopia.
Here it is.
Sorry.
I was right.
You're wrong.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Okay.
So...
Is...
Is in intrepate...
Is there only...
To that?
I don't think so.
It's very cool.
Um...
Actually...
Oh.
A bomb?
Yes.
Is it got 24.0?
Yep.
That would be...
I don't notice any difference.
See, it's incremental.
Very incremental.
Cool.
So, right now you guys want to tell us about...
So I got more.
More.
This is like one of the funniest sentences that isn't funny ever.
Scroll down a little bit to underneath this picture.
Right there.
That...
No, right underneath the picture.
It's actually the picture.
Click to enlarge.
Richard and Stalin.
Click to enlarge.
I don't know why.
That just struck me as extremely funny.
And, um...
That's not the enlarged picture.
Like...
That's browser making it small.
Make it big.
Like big.
Click on the image.
Just click on the image.
No, don't do that.
Go back.
Go where you were.
Click on the image.
Just click on the image.
That's a little bit.
That's almost offensive.
I want to be steep.
Oh boy.
Let's go back.
Sorry, I made you do that.
Yeah, he's larger than life.
That's what it was.
I mean, come on.
You can set that as your background.
And that would be great.
No.
It's a little funny.
Yeah, just don't wake up and don't look back.
I just don't want to watch anymore.
Yep.
So, you know, every move needs to have a visionary.
And I guess he is.
And it's 25 years of sending out of the GNU project.
And because it's such an easy work to say.
Good marketing.
There.
Just, did you, have you guys ever heard him?
No.
No.
At some point, he was interviewed.
And somehow, he got annoyed by an interview.
And his statement was, you're not confusing your own question.
Some of the other people were pointing at some kind.
Oh, beautiful.
You go.
You go.
You rock on.
So, tell me how somebody can be combined with his own question.
Can you confuse your own question?
Yeah.
See?
So, uh,
Tunes funding vector graphics analytics.
Yep.
What do you want to tell us about it?
I'll put one more.
Okay.
It is easy.
How about my mother?
Sorry.
I don't know.
It's difficult.
What does that mean?
It means it does have some vector support now.
The system resources and components.
And then you can sculpt the paths.
That's all the things.
If you want to do anything advanced, you have to put it again.
Why are you making a marathon?
Yeah.
I don't think they knew how to use vector.
How about this car, carbon?
It's okay.
It's the same scale as that of a model.
It's the same scale as that of a model.
Okay.
Thank you.
So, in scale, it's the tool.
MetaSylane A-0 near release.
Which I was already sort of wondering what a metastasis could use to be very friendly.
And the model is still probably very friendly distribution.
But then it was quite sometimes.
Here it is.
It's coming up again.
Here is that article about the D.R. Music Service.
Another one based on us.
And it is Walmart right now.
So they are saying the third one.
And it is after Yahu.
And it's Walmart.
And guess what?
Maybe an iTunes.
So how much is the D.R.M?
Choice.
So what's here?
Well, long.
They got your money.
Not mine.
And they are saying that all what you need to do, you just cannot rebuild your computer.
It's going to be okay.
No worries.
Yeah.
Windows.
You know, so distracted operating system.
As long as you have all seven years of experience.
Where the machine you set.
Yes.
And you have three people I use.
Absolutely.
I do anything virtually.
I have a brood here virtually.
At the house.
Maybe again.
Oh, boy.
That was it.
There was an article about Fedora.
Fedora is good to have a 5-year anniversary.
Would anybody read it?
I just browse through it.
And patience.
Patience.
Yeah.
That's what one says.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
You said here earlier.
Cool.
So is it distribution for Google?
No.
I don't know.
It's like this.
Are you asking me?
Tell me before.
Is that.
Is.
I'm sorry.
Is that distribution for developers?
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Fedora.
Never mind.
Fedora.
Yeah.
I'm happy.
I'm happy.
Yeah.
No.
I'm happy.
It's trying to understand the question.
I didn't think it was going to happen.
You.
You used your work question.
Yeah.
It was like.
Hey.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
I know.
You need to put it back in a background and stop.
Now I'm here.
I don't know.
I know you need a little second.
I just see the amount now.
Nice meeting you.
Thanks.
I need it.
If somebody is confusing his question, he was just shown around.
VLC goes to 9.2 release, they are saying that there was a new release of VLC and whatever
reason they are tuning about it, it has a new, pretty thing around and it's supposed to
be...
Much easier.
I've got intrepid and I've got 9.3.
Yeah, I just downloaded 9.3 for a week, so you guys are leakers, because this mess from
September 26th or ahead, you've got to keep up, it's too old, too old, it's okay, moving
on.
How bad was that version if they were already got a 9.3 and something like that?
Actually, it was...
Maybe we were just a bug for the rest, yeah, I think some issues with plainlessly stoked.
It works.
Works really good?
Really not.
Great.
It's like you can right click on an ISO file, but it doesn't work, but it doesn't work.
See, you need to have a different version.
It works, though.
Yeah, it's just fine.
It's not all the long.
It's fine.
And then it has all the features.
Everything you want to see just looks like.
So all I've heard about one of the new features is a BLC is now BitMaps.
Like, I think you can even use like that.
The interface just doesn't work.
Do everything you need to see.
So make your own.
It's a BitMaps.
It's a piece, right?
Yeah, it's a...
Zine had some okay stuff, but nobody ever developed anything for it to make it really
look good.
It worked like a real nice plate.
I made it complicated to skin it and stuff.
It's a different one.
On the other side, we were able to...
The video from Starfleet Freedom Day with a transcoated window screen,
before we were using a BLC for that.
Well, I think one of the...
Make it a really appealing, especially BLC because it's cross-platform.
I mean, both Windows and Linux and stuff.
And that would really make it different.
You think it works well for their music cues, maybe.
It's part of life.
It's maybe easier to do this.
Because they're using WX, which is cool as hell.
But I think that was actually quite large release.
Yeah, because they said they added a ton of code apps too.
This release, so it could be coming down on a player.
Well, it's the same thing.
Like, you know, I want one player, which is good.
You know, instead of seven, we should have a video.
Yeah, I always found a little deficient in each one.
You know, the hot piece and one don't work in another one.
You know, you have to use buttons for that.
Just...
Yeah, perfect.
This is what we'll do at all.
Yeah.
GameStreamer had the right idea.
Yeah, the one they made, the HDI is so complex,
but it could work on some board.
So you can have that extraction layer.
Yeah, exactly.
You didn't just have everything that I've heard.
Yeah.
Programmers have tried writing some board.
You just give it up in Roger's home,
because the state gets to the point of observing
how complex the HDI is.
Yeah, you can get to something.
That's, you know, there was an article about jungle.
There was a lot of money.
Linux on API jungle, you know.
So it is, you know, you have this framework,
and that framework, and this framework,
and also which one you are going to use.
I see like even here on DLC.
I play a video.
It expands the window out to play the video.
And I hit stop and expands everything back in.
So my buttons are always moving back and forth
as I play a stop.
You think I should just keep the window the same size
where I want it.
Do you have your finger exercise?
Yeah.
It's not very good.
It just makes it, like you say,
the user interface is all that great.
A lot of those are everywhere.
Because it's not a family game game game game.
Yep.
There was an article about did you can?
I don't know.
I hit GitHub on her in the wrong.
It's a D&G.
Yeah.
It's a D&G.
What is D&G?
I mean, I assume it's like a D&G.
It's just for a video.
Here is a digital negative.
It's a digital negative.
And I think it's from there again
because we're out to whatever we want.
Pull out snapshots.
Come on, dammit.
Yes.
Come on.
Yes.
Good thing about it.
Great.
Great.
Yes.
It's interesting.
Well, you know, if you have hope,
English name.
You know, all of a sudden you're going to see it again.
Yeah.
That's my point.
I do it.
Jabba sound music software for the next part three.
Oh.
Last week we had part two.
So right now we're part three.
Okay.
Well, that's where it is.
How many do you want to do?
Yeah.
Hey, somebody took our fat pick you in here.
Okay.
Yeah.
That is something.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Somebody stole it again.
I guess you could make an email about saying
that Holly's $12.
So there is a notification of something.
Okay.
I mean, it's not one.
Oh, yeah.
It's not one.
It's from Mary's.
Because it's, uh, the next, uh,
because it's Java, you're saying.
I got it.
It's probably on the old platform.
And Harry wants us.
We're making a video for the schoolers.
Um, um, there was contributing to the guy who is
writing up in the streets.
Well, there will be, they know that after he comes
with a lot of people.
So we did.
We're shutting it.
Oh, how would it be then?
And the shanty and the door was opened.
And so I just watched my hands and told them
that this is a really broken and delicious thing.
Well, I think that, uh, he is from somewhere from up.
Yeah.
He's from somewhere from there.
So I can't talk to him.
I can't talk to him.
Don't come playing, please.
Okay.
I got you.
I did read that.
Yeah.
It's usually good.
He's just gentle.
He's still writing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's still working.
It's actually.
I thought it a while ago.
I like it quite a bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just messing with it a minute ago.
Well, actually, there was something when he talked about
Gen 2.
Uh, they were supposed to have a release and they call it off.
So, uh, is it like, uh, if Gen 2 is in trouble or not?
Yeah.
Usually, if you have that, uh, distribution, if you call for a release,
you try to make it, is there a canceling?
And if you miss your deadline, okay, so you miss your deadline.
So, it was either push it back until it's kind of done like Fedora
or you shove it out the door.
Yeah.
But normally, you don't call it off, but you don't call it off.
Yeah.
That's kind of strange.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, right.
But then you still have it.
But it's, uh, Linux, uh, API, Gen 2, uh, God is writing.
Uh, I think it's not what he had done.
It's changed, it's, uh, guys from, uh, post audio.
He's writing on to what to do.
So, if you are going to write some audio obligations, what to use?
Yeah.
So.
Thank you.
I'm not going to write anything.
It was interesting, you know, that, uh, it is, it is a jungle out there.
And we have back 21 best free Linux financial software.
And, uh, wasn't it used to be 41?
I think they scaled down to 29.
I think it was 41.
Was it?
And, uh, so I didn't work with this one.
Yeah, I have money to see.
That's sort of true, yes.
Why would you need to have money?
I'm still plenty handy one.
Money dance.
Money dance.
That'll work, you find?
I don't, I don't think money dance is here.
It's, uh, Gen 2.
It's Java.
I need to pay for it.
Do you see it too?
Yeah, I do.
You know, you need to have money to run money dance.
You dance with the money.
It was a $20, $15, $15, $15.
A lot of the 40, and if there's 20, a few games, it's just better.
Oh, I didn't give you $20.
I didn't give you the $20.
That's the same.
See, I'm just $20 a pool here.
I gave you $20 or the bottle stuff, but you're pure.
Okay, I'll be quiet then.
And then we're talking about Nokia,
renamed Troltec to Cutopia.
Yeah, I'm going to look up the store.
Bye, bye.
And, uh, do they actually have a useful phone out now?
Excuse me.
Or is it still development?
Is this thing?
They have a useful phone out?
That's...
The Android?
No, this is not...
This is a different one.
Yeah, this is QT.
QT, so...
Did they have that over phone?
Or was that a different one?
It was Michael.
Oh, that's of Michael.
Open DNS is working well.
Cool.
Let's do that now.
Great.
Thanks to Alia.
You know, those open source tools, you know.
They were in their library.
You guys should look up Alice.
What about...
It's a...
I was reading a book about a professor who was really virtual reality.
I think I've seen that, like...
In the years ago?
They make it for Windows Units, or Linux, and Mac.
And that was...
It's all like...
It's all like...
It's Alice.
It's not work.
It's all a...
Virtual interface to do virtual reality,
or type storyboard, you think.
And I...
Yeah.
I messed with it for a little bit.
It's pretty interesting.
A new way to teach programming.
Yeah.
And they've got a middle school-like version,
so you can teach younger kids with it.
Is it like a programming language?
Well, you don't even seem if you can go into the language.
For example, I took one where I put the scene rate of an ocean off,
and then I took a person and put them floating in the ocean.
And then I put a shark in there.
And then I told the shark to go over this farm,
just like it's having the person's sense,
and the skeleton comes out, and then it both comes out.
And all of that's done by dragging the drop-in pictures,
telling you how far to move,
without even introducing a program.
Because it was actually writing code...
Yeah, me?
Yeah, and then you can go into that code to choose to...
To find two minutes.
The guy that is scrolled at the bottom,
Carnegie Mellon,
is the university he wrote that.
He was a differential reality professor,
and he recently died of hatred and cancer,
so this is one of the projects that he had done.
And so on his...
in his memory,
they're enhancing it,
and giving it away.
So, a fool?
Yeah, you see a memory of Randy Palsch,
right about that.
Go and see the last lecture.
Did you read that?
I saw I washed some of it on your phone.
We had the guy who had the terminal almost...
Yeah, actually.
Somebody's forcing me to read it,
and it's trying to get the call from me.
Because I have a terminal almost.
Yeah.
But...
I'll put it in the newsletter.
Yeah, it's kind of a cool little tool.
Cool?
Thank you.
You ready?
Thank you very much.
That's more of a good source of tools.
I'll be sure to let you know.
That sounds good.
Actually, I've never got an old charting one.
Now, old charting is new.
Is new?
Is new?
Yeah.
I found it comparable to old.
It doesn't seem to be cool.
What is the name of it?
I know about two of them.
One is key idea.
I don't want to tell you about it.
Do you know?
All right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Cool?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
What do you do?
I switch to...
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch.
I'm not going to switch that out, but it's like the ones of these things.
The picture of people.
At work, what we did.
She said yes.
She said yes.
Okay.
Readance, but he spreadsheets you.
And he went towards you.
They have a dental program.
It actually had like...
a more head, eyes and nose,
then the mouth of different people I am.
Oh, 진짜 Turned Around?
Oh, that's cool.
So I printed them out.
And then we put them on a board,
put them on deodorant.
And then...
Let people move things around.
Yeah.
And one of my un...
Has...
My co-workers printed out a fiction from the org chart, since it is in America.
So I put my fiction from the org chart.
So now we're mixing and matching pieces from the org chart.
Oh, that's scary.
Different people.
Oh, they look so funny.
Actually, you know, when you have, you know, talking about it,
a lot of the time, the police, they have database of large sets of eyes and noses.
That's insane.
And you flip through them and you just try to go and sort of...
That is exactly what it looks like, too.
It looks like a luncheon.
Because she has, you know, I will go there to my set.
Yeah, I might have to.
Yeah.
And when I look there, I will know how.
They have lots of houtons this week.
We have, um...
Oh, right.
Huh?
What?
Still working with someone?
Because he always, um...
Actually, when he was working.
Yes.
Microsoft.
He was going to show me something.
So, I'm going to show us.
Do I not have it?
Maybe I don't.
I will in a second.
What am I doing?
Dancing bears?
This is not interesting.
You can go on.
We have lots of houtons.
We have a virtual box headless running virtual machine with a virtual box 2.0 on Ubuntu Server.
Which is nice.
Because if you are running virtual machine, you don't want to have overhead of this stuff.
Turn your touchpad off and on with the shortcut key in Ubuntu.
So, I guess it is probably just the key binding.
And so, VMware Server 2 on all of VMware Server 2 was released.
If somebody cares.
How's running?
It's running very well.
It's not chewing up too many resources.
I am having some crashes in Firefox, where it will freeze the browser.
So, that doesn't work too well.
I'm trying it now.
No, it didn't try out.
If I just go into the web interface now, if I go into the web interface, it works fine.
Something goes weird when you launch the plugin to get the screen for your virtual terminal.
What do they call it?
The virtual terminal.
Yeah, the virtual terminal.
You have to install a 20 megabut plugin and it's a program to get the modern virtual machine.
When I launch one of those, the web browser will hang in like three or four minutes of use.
So, you must have shut it down.
Why is VMware so big?
It's like, yeah, so almost 600 megabytes.
Yeah, virtual box is 17 megabytes.
Well, they've got Java package, Tomcat package in there.
You've got your...
I don't remember VMware being that big.
It was always about 150 megabytes.
Yeah, it was 150 megabytes of the server.
Virtual box is 20 megabytes.
With virtual box 20 or 30, you have 20 or 30.
They also include...
Well, the console in there, but the virtual box will have that.
They also have a web interface for statistics on all the VMs that you have.
But it's not heavy on the graphics, but it's got all the...
Probably the hooks into getting all the metrics off of the VMs and stuff.
They're still not convincing.
I'm trying to think what else they would have on there.
The networking is way, way better.
They have...
Does virtual box have USB support?
Yes.
Okay.
Virtual box 100 megabytes.
They probably aren't clean.
I mean, very clean and stuff like that.
But they definitely have all the plug-ins for all the VM moving
and all the interfacing that VMware has.
So, yeah, I would say no, they're about as clean.
But there's definitely more features, but not the same stuff.
Not the same stuff.
I was running my server in a virtual box and every week or so,
something would flake out and it would just start chewing on them.
Do you guys see...
I would think a virtual box would be much faster.
It's just being a smaller VMB app, a little heavier and stuff.
But...
Yeah, I'm running a regular server on my server.
And I don't think it's using this much resources.
So...
The one thing that VM server does do is it will go after your hypervisor level.
Yeah.
If you've got it enabled on your CPU.
So, if your CPU supports hypervisor, it will...
Does that do itself?
I use virtual box in here just to get...
Because it's more of a lip station.
Yes.
But the server one, I think, is much more stable.
I've had better luck with it with just letting it run for weeks at a time.
Ah, it's just a lot.
It's using virtual box.
Very, right.
And when we talk about a VMB server,
the one series had not really used any stuff.
One that's your old, that's seven.
Hi, hi, David.
What if it's a woman running at work right now?
Is it wrong to run at work?
Yeah.
And that's seven.
Yeah.
I just saw it.
That's what I'm...
That's good, it's not running at work.
Oh, that one.
That one here.
Oh dear.
What is...
How to control Apache with...
There was a tool.
A bad line tool.
And one of the things,
but you can actually set up your Apache,
and you can point to the setup file when I work with it.
But if it's production...
There's a tool you can use.
It's a timeline tool.
So set up your Apache production.
I'm happy they made that change out there.
I will.
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, I will.
Yeah.
I...
My scripts are running fast.
Which one?
My AnScript.
AnScript.
I haven't had the touch production with an FTP program.
Ooh.
Yeah.
What else do you have there?
Mounting ISO images with...
Say that.
Furious?
Furious.
ISO mount on Ubuntu.
Install in Google Android SDK.
1.0 on Ubuntu desktop.
I haven't done it yet.
I haven't done it yet.
So can you install it on Twitter?
I think I'm probably too lazy to switch in the near future.
Android SDK.
I was looking at that.
I was just wanting for a clip.
Yes.
It's the same Java.
Is it the standard Java?
So if I write something for Android, will it run somewhere else?
Um.
It's got a custom API or something for it.
Yeah.
It looks into the GPS and the camera.
If you layer it properly, you probably could do a way
with writing a application that will run both.
What?
Do you have to use it for writing?
I just want to take out a forecasting application and put it on Android.
You might be able to write it in your face like that.
No, that is just a bad joke.
Never mind.
Just keep on moving.
Easy file upload with Drupi.
I can Drupi use the service.
Yeah, I showed that a couple weeks ago.
Yeah.
Tell me what it is again.
It's a one script website that allows you to upload a file to your PC.
And actually, on your home directory, creates a directory.
And then it is just like extended files.
What is the size of it again?
You give it the directory and it will put it in that directory.
Yes, but what is the size of the server?
Because it's a service on a cloud.
No, we must be talking about the different things then.
Click on that one.
Oh, no.
Try and do that.
Drupi is just...
Just see.
Support someone with a send you a large file.
Basically, what it is is they come to your...
You run this one script.
It produces a website at a particular port you specify.
When someone goes to that website.
Yeah, we talk about this.
It just gives you a one-liner item.
Browse your PC.
You put it in the any size file.
And it will send it to the server.
Oh, cool.
But it is.
It's just a one-file script.
Perl.
I think it was the same.
Perl.
Perl?
I think it's a Perl script.
I hope to do it anything.
Perl.
Yeah.
You just got read it.
Not yet.
Perl?
It's a Python.
It's a good Python.
Cool.
And it works.
So you try it?
Yep.
I don't know why I do that.
I want to scroll down here.
What else we have?
Set up Yahoo Zimbra.
That's stopped on a buncher.
That's probably...
Yeah, Zimbra.
That's stopped.
So you don't have to have a web interface.
You can have also the client interface.
It is...
Actually, I would say that it is probably the...
What do you call it?
Prison application?
Okay.
So they wrote the same application.
It runs in a browser or as a client.
Hello?
Welcome.
Welcome back.
Same application in the browser or...
Absolutely.
So you duplicate a lot of Google apps and what not?
The Zimbra is your...
How do you call it?
Probably not the communication suite.
Collaboration suite.
So Zimbra is actually your...
The hair server.
Your calendar.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
The Google is trying to get into all that.
The Zobal thing.
Yeah.
The article.
And when I finish reading it...
Oh, it does the next week.
Material again.
Again?
Oh, yeah.
You cannot talk about stuff like that.
Well, anyways, it came down to it.
There's a lot of stuff out there.
There's a lot of other neat things.
But the Google stuff just seems to work on me.
I mean, I have all the bells in this room.
And they might be, you know, collecting your data.
Yeah, yeah.
That's what I'm doing too.
Cool.
What else do we have there?
Getting access to home server.
Despite having dynamic IP address.
So somebody is talking about...
Dying DNS.
And how to set it up, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
And how to set it up, I think.
They talk about that this dd client.
So you need to run dd client to or...
...then your server.
And they have a new installed client.
Yes.
Yes I think so.
You can go to aptitude install dd client.
That's probably what it is.
And then here's a configuration of the dd client.
I never did it.
If you go through aptitude,
And it'll actually walk you through a little wizard who does it at the command line a little set up, which is a lot of routers now
Especially when you're running it
That's what I've got running at home
But even just go software that comes on the router and you just give it to your login and stuff like that
And you'll take care of refreshing it every day and stuff like that
Sorry, I can't give it to you
Yeah, I'm sure yes
He's using these keys, but he didn't read we generate all my keys
Cool, so they're all included in the generative
Read to now
I download a scary case for the room to pass through this
Good, because I wasn't getting updates anymore
I'm like, why not? Oh, that's right
All right, you're key
Then we talk about it
Yeah, we talk about it
I have some
I have some
Listen
Do you ever?
Yeah
So Zimbr is a channel like an outlook group that's going to tell you
Zimbr is actually, yes, it's your backhand as well as from them
Yes
A lot of people like it
Does it interface with anything besides?
Yeah, I do
No, no, no, no, it's mail on its own
It's a mail service, it's own mail server
It's own mail server
So you would sit up with like a dining with DNS
Accept or do you
Is the kind of act as a client who like a pop three or another
No, it is full feature mail server
As well as then you have full feature clients
Great
Do you
It would that you would you be able to set that up with dining with DNS
Then to be able to
I don't know, probably
Maybe
But it is actually, it is not slouch
It is, you know, it can handle
10,000 error losses
It is actually the big, big, you know, the full feature
All right, mail service
Well, it just looks like the link from the newsletter looks like you
Entering like a Yahoo man
I don't know if this is set up with a Gmail
I hate
That's your client
This is just a client thing
Yes
Yeah, I'm not actually installing server
Got just installing client
So you are, you are putting whatever
Canvas
You know
Is there a
Zero web based client
For example, so you wouldn't have to install anything
I don't think so
And that's what I was saying that I think is written in prison
With a prison
So the same code runs as a client
Or as a desktop
Oh, that's cool
Cool
Oh, client org
It's integrals
How's the movie?
It's basketball
So it works so good
No stalls
I don't know why they hear that
The VLC are stalling out
I know, I was trying a new VLC and I kept on stalling
No reason, nothing no activity or anything
Just stall
Well, because they were copyrighted
I don't confuse you
You are, I'm not sure
But that
I feel like free for every person
There was that
Quite interesting article about recovering
Del瑜d files
Formals and alcohol, too
But anyway, look at that
I've been coming here in the blue
It is actually there, though
I used to study online, and I was
Before I was 50 bucks away
Fixing somebody's hard drive, so
I was just 50 bucks away
It was an external hard drive
And basically, it comes up
Nothing that you recognize, you have the phone out
So the partition table is gone
So I thought it several windows utilities
You stop
None of them could fix it
And then I used
How there's a test
Test disk
Linux program
That you just tell it well
I believe it was this kind of partition
Goes out there and searches the whole hard drive
Yeah, I see a partition out there
You want me to take the backup copy
And put it on top of the primary
Did it?
The whole thing came back
NTS
This was a fat 32
This was a 320 gig
External drive
This is the iBox
Was it able to restore the data then
Yep
All the data came right back just like that
Basically, the primary partition got killed
They didn't ever left
They didn't ever left
If the backup partition was over
But none of the other windows tools worked
But the Linux one did it right
All the empty access
The backup partition at the end of the drive
Oh, it's interesting
Okay, I didn't know that
It has the backup partition
Yes
The partition is actually duplicate
Once it's eliminated, once it's eliminated
The partition table
The partition table
Okay
The backup partition table
Yeah
And
The last one is backing up your eyes
You have dv
Shots
I use dd quite often
Then drives and different things
They run it through compression on here
Yeah
It's
It's quite a long article
I did the whole HP server
With RAID
And it worked really well
I did a test restart too
And it worked just fine
It's like it's just
That's so annoying
When my
External drive got corrupted
I got a dd on it
I got a dd gig image
And then I used test disks
Go through and pull over and off and make it define
Really
And
I don't know if I lost any of the test disks
So what did that program get?
Did that backup?
Yeah, we used one of those tricks
To
RAID all zeros in the drive
Yes, I had to do that
And
It was still a fairly fresh drive
So I really only changed the size
Maybe by 10%
Well, I actually had changed it quite a bit
It's too much
I can't see how did I do this
It didn't change at that much
But
It was quite a bit smaller either way
Because it's still come
Because it uses the gzip in there
And it compressed it pretty good
After I wrote zeros to it, I did it again
It was only like 10% difference
Wasn't that big of a deal
What you've done zero all the free space?
Yeah, you
And that's why they say these utilities
Dd is a lot slower than ghost
Because ghost knows that anything
Beyond the partition is ignored
There's the ZD rule
And so
I think it was there
But if you just do zero again
Yes, Dd is a partition
Never tried that in the end
This was going after a computer
Up here Windows server
So it worked really well
So
Basically
Who did a Ubuntu off the key
On the drive and then tell the commands
So it was pretty good
And I worked in the
Capital Dd
Forward
Yeah
Yep, more chair
And we're just fine
And that was a HP DL 380 server
With like
Three drives and a rate five configuration
Something
Restored it
We came up came all back
Including partitions
Who partitions
So what did you know
Was it just a command you don't use it
Yeah, it's just a one
It's just a
But the command
Is real easy
Explanation
That's a trick
What you do
All zeros to a file
And then eventually the drive gets full
And then you just delete five
Yeah, you basically
It's a copy command
Copy
To this file
And there is actually a
Zero
It's like a null zero type thing
And you don't put any size to it
So it just starts writing to a
Let file
And it continues on forever
And finally it fills up your entire hard drive
And then you scroll that file away
And now you just zeroed out the entire
In the directory there's only one thing
One thing with journaled file systems
That won't ever really zero on the whole file system
Not the whole thing
But it'll get
Closing out for this
Because then you when you delete it
Obviously going to a
Unzero
Yeah, and they put the delete
Can't command one big thing
So it's just one command
You let it run
And when it gets done
It's also gone again
But now it's all zeroed out
So it's really only really two commands
One to zero out the stuff
And then the other one just to
DD and
GZip your hard drive
Depending on your file system
There are commands
That can do that
I don't think there's one
The XT3 button
I think the XFS
You can actually
Free space
Where does the XT4
Is it coming soon?
The XT4
I think it is in the kernel already
Yeah
The bacon of the
That's where it's all going again
No, it's in 27 kernel already
If you're getting used it
I didn't know what to
I don't know if I'd use it
I'm not going to use it
Like if you were here
I didn't take that some days
No, it is
It is ruined
Here it is
Or you can use the DD case
The DD2 with the XT4
It's all out
OK, zero
Which is a new zero
Like X
I'm like
How do you call RGN?
It's just a file
Really
And then you say
Just a
I think it's a second or a problem
And I say over and
If you just let that run
It will grow
continuously
Because it's a problem
Just zeroed in
Because it is
It's not far
Right
And then you just
Have to make a new data
It's already hidden
It's just a new one
And then it's just
Yeah
Well
There's the command
The same
The same
The array
And they've got some other things
I think
The same
And it's all rounded out every single time
You've got the data
Don't cash it or anything
You know
Or whatever
And then pipe it with a gzip
And then it will fall
And then it will take your time
So are you running a rate 5
Yeah
This is a rate 5
So then
You're only copying your two data
Drives then basically
I'm copying the two part
Because it's two data partitions
And I already
I know
I've carried it
See that talk
And gave me a shout out down
So that it's just copying the two
Right
Partitions
The two partitions
And the cDrive is
Blue Cartician
So
I think we have that in the reporting
Okay
So thanks for listening
See you next week
We need a thing
Thank you for listening
