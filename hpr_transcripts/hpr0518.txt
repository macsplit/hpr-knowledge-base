Getting Things Done, Life Without a Gooe by Jared Bernard, October 9, 2009, at the Utah
Open Source Conference. This recording was a little rough. I cleaned it up the best I could.
Let me know if it was worth listening to. I might be able to come up with another one
for your enjoyment. Let me know. This is Kuvmo. Kuvmo at gmail.com. Kuvmo at

And you can also do PDFs with this as well.
And you can also edit images.
I don't know how expensive I am.
I live from there, probably with image magic.
It's pretty powerful.
I need to do some really cool things.
And then I'm so good at options.
I'll do a look up the documentation for that.
But it's really amazing they can do.
And with the scripting line, you're choosing that
to edit documents.
So let's look up at the ID and see what photos look like.
And again, I'm going to have to go back into the front
of the page.
The frame buffer, if no one knows, that most distributions
initiated by default in the distribution, a few of them.
Blacklisted.
And so you have to comment it out.
But if you basically Google it and your distribution
and frame buffer, they'll show you how to activate it.
Usually you have to go into grub and edits,
the kernel line, and the VGA, the rules, whatever
resolution you want, to be honest.
It's usually how you get into the frame buffer
and send it to these.
So that's it.
So then with the FBI, I don't know what it's
and we'll just hear it again.
So this is the frame buffer.
I'm just going to end this.
Pretty crystal clear.
I mean, this is on 1024, the 768 resolution.
And you can actually consume now.
You can zoom in.
I open up everything in this directory.
So this works for everything that we're going to do.
I'm going to add a picture of that.
There are images.
See here, man.
What are we going to find out?
So there's not much more here.
How about listening to music?
Music is all we've got to listen to music, right?
So here are a few applications that play music.
My favorite is it's coming up and we'll see.
We'll play it.
We'll do it in like a few minutes here.
I'll just show you how it works.
You can create playlists and things like that.
You get a series of music going.
And Tyga, it's pretty close.
Good for a large music collection, you get that.
Music playlists, there's a billion music playlists out there.
They can now line.
And you also have to have the right codex.
So let's music and see what else.
Burdy CDs and beauty CDs.
CD record has been around a long time.
A great application.
You've built a lot of front-end support.
One of my favorites there is my bash burn.
I'm going to use this cursing as a kind of a menu system.
So I'm going to have to remove all the switches and options.
And then put it on.
Just need to record.
Great.
Just kind of simplistic application.
I'm going to bring it up with a header install.
I guess that's it.
What do you have here?
I'm gaming.
Let's talk about gaming.
We'll kind of finish off on that.
Is everyone like to play the games?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, OK, well thanks.
I appreciate that.
OK, good.
So games here, BST games, I love BST games.
They're kind of been around for a while.
And they have a lot of these texts.
So you're going to have a lot of great things with the text games.
There are a few of them on this, but they're
going to be not really follow-in, and you know,
sneak, tetris, things like that.
I can show you a few of those here.
A few other ones, Net Hack.
Net Hack has been around for a $4.
And the new chest, my name is Pat Manclone.
New Vikings.
I'll show you a few of those.
And then I'll show you how to play Quake, which is kind
of a more action game.
So let me show you some of the BST games.
Wow, like this is hangman, the stud hangman, which is called
the marriage, you get letters, and I'm going to push it up here.
Do you know where to sleep?
Not very good, Pat.
I'm not.
I'm just going to sleep.
I'm just going to sleep now.
OK, then we're going to see the Tetris.
Just Tetris.
Just this little, pretty big game, and that.
So all of these things are nobody.
All of them are nobody.
Good job.
I'm going to keep you busy for hours, right?
All right, you know, all right, we're almost getting to take.
All right, you know, on the website, there's several ASCII ways to ask me where, you can add that, you can very hard to look at.
There's also a way to get an ASCII out of using that, you know, right there, so much of things and stuff.
But it's like a bird using a dot simulator, just because we could games built your dots, basically.
There's a lot of cool dot games out there, most of them are free, you can find them on your net, and they will play with them.
So, I'll kind of show you how to do that. Again, we have to use the SDL library, so this is going to go away.
You'll be able to show that.
But the dosing layer that I use is dosing up, and it runs free dots, and it's just really cool.
You want to pull it up in the SDL library and use the dash capital S Trader for the SDL library.
So, that's what I'll be doing, and also use the hands to pull it up and show you how to do that.
There's a quick plan.
You guys have to add half of it when you try it.
So, like I said, even though both the ice games are fun to play, you can plan the stossing layer.
Whatever else is recorded, you're solving it when you want.
Alright, a few other things, but I think it's really interesting that you can do that.
You just don't have time to go on. There's problem management.
MC, I love MC. There's a million others out there. I just didn't see them.
The problem management, similar to the old Martin Commander, remember back in the boss, we don't know what it is.
You know, we have two panels on the side.
It's great, but I don't know what that is.
The problem management is bigger.
A bunch of social networking things can block.
Charm, I hear it's really good. I've never used it.
I don't use too much broadly. I don't get a lot of it.
I do a guy in my theater.
Twitter, my dedicated guy are there.
There's several scripts out there. You can actually write your own.
There's tutorials on that.
Using curl and how to write your own scripts.
I've wrote a script for the API, a corporation networking application.
You can do the last step in the music, show at them.
There's a great program, you can do the last step in the account.
You can do your Facebook.
It updates your status on Facebook.
That's the script.
You can do other people's updates on Facebook.
And second line, even, I've never played second line,
where we can use the chat client in that
and we can get a second line on the command line.
So all the social networking stuff we covered,
and actually I can use a lot of doing clients
for Twitter and for Identica.
There always been problems that really didn't like them
and I'm just on the command line now.
And I just use this channel on the client.
And so he's a query, the text,
or if I'm looking for a certain person
to put it in a comment, and just grip it,
and it's just so nice to be able to search.
This information, this is the prompt catch
and the social networking, but
the little depends option there.
For Google, for a calendar, and scheduling,
G, Cal Queen is great.
I did it all the time with Google Summer Code project.
That is just amazing.
And you can pull multiple calendars.
I want to have the calendar, I have one of them.
I want to create it once my kids is all there.
There's schedule, I can do all of those,
I can fill it with them, I can pull up any data I want.
And I can, and you can use it in like a matrix
where it actually draws it out with boxes and squares
or other ways you can do this.
There's a script for it, if you want to put it in the concrete,
so you have a calendar appointments listed there
for concrete in the next few days,
things like that, and there's an app, full of that.
There's also Cal Curse, which is kind of a
cursive type of calendar system, which is more traditional.
I think I have that on.
So it looks like that, and now we get the calendar,
and pretty strong, if I want to have it in there.
And like that, it seems to be really good to do it.
The idea of things to do lists, kinds of managers,
go to school, text file, do, script,
script, it's great.
I call it, it's for a long time.
It's written in Python, and it has some great search options
because they're using categorizing and prioritizing certain things.
You're just searching like categories and priorities,
and things like that.
It's a really powerful and task order.
I've actually been in contact with the developer task
for a really good guy who saw the project on my website,
and one contact with me, and I haven't been able to
get the term in Python as well,
and then there's the application, and there's
that in the list, and like that, out there,
and search for it.
All right, by the end of the county,
there's Ledger and Clia, because they're grounded.
Clia is very, very talented, and the idea is Ledger.
Ledger is great.
The query, I've been able to use it to query
like a new cache file.
If you use the new cache at all,
you can read that in the compressed file,
and that query is really powerful.
That should make entries as a little tougher
where I use it as a query.
The new Q&A, you're going to do a lot more in banking,
and you're transferring it to pull down your bankifiers.
You don't have to check what you've got,
and they've made a good one as well.
All right, there's A-Wug.
If you're looking for address books, which is really nice.
I actually just copied this script.
It's a grid script that searches a three-pound sign,
and that's the way to divide up my contact.
So I'll show you that, and that's pretty cool here.
So basically, what I have is just a visit text file
of an average grid, but I can't plot the text.
OK, so this is a text file.
You'll copy that in this form, and you'll
have to change it.
And see everything is delimited by those three-pound sign.
So now it's just really easy to have a grid,
also on the side of the grid.
There it is.
One line of our address block there, and then one line of the grid.
And that's in a long time.
And basically, all it does is look for that's
a limited three-pound sign.
So when I want to look, look out for Andrew.
So I just do contact, and it pulls up anything again.
Game in that file.
So it's just like following, just like email.
I've been looking at what the model looks like on my screen.
So everyone looks like I've been looking at a lot of other
kind of grid.
It's so nice to just copy and paste my email into the text
file, or copy and paste from the website, or whatever.
You need to contact me.
That's really good.
All right.
I'm going to figure out a little more slide.
No, no, no, no, take it right.
Some other things you can do, genealogy,
math, astronomy, you can use your webcam,
password, paper, voice over IP, your IRC, standing,
vector drawing, all these things you don't need to have left.
All right.
Questions?
Anyone?
The data that you read at red, what is it?
Which one?
The one I showed you, the script?
Yeah.
The text and what I got for them to show you.
It's very, it's self-created, genealogy.
Yeah.
It's just great.
So it's not, I think it's actually on my website.
I think it's not, I think it's on my website.
What do you do with the script?
Do we see how I got home when it's on net?
There's a form to print out two things, like color,
different dress, different dress, where to get word.
I can find a job, so I'm going to put that in the bag
and tell it the truth and stuff.
Any other applications, any other questions?
I'll put one in the corner and I'll put it in the corner
and do it with a brain type program.
How hard do you get to go through that?
It's really, it's like anything else.
It took me probably five, 10 minutes.
I mean, Dan, because I only really wanted to know
how to create a new video, how to live them around,
and how to maximize one.
And then I went, OK.
So any other questions?
Well, I'm not going to go through this,
but I appreciate your guys coming.
Thanks.
Cheers.
