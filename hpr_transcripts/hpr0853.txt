I don't know, do you mind if I interview you about slapping her a little bit?
No.
Good.
All right, well, hey, everyone, this is Vlad too.
Hey, what are you doing here?
When did you get here?
There we go.
Yeah?
Oh, I didn't know you were coming here.
Cool.
This is Pat, by the way.
Hello.
Pat, both your dean, rather.
Nice to meet you.
This is Mako.
She's a devian dev yet?
Or not yet?
No, I'm going to go to that.
Yeah, but I'm going to the application process for devian maintainer.
Maintainer?
That's anything with the word developer or maintainer after it.
I think you people know, you know, magical things.
Okay.
Feel like incense?
Yeah, I do.
Japanese Indian?
Indian is what I've mostly smelt.
All right.
This, Japanese.
Saidudo Shirogiiku.
Familiar with the ingredient Kaira.
You know what that is?
Okay.
There is a type of tree.
I don't remember the genus species, but it's an evergreen type tree that grows in rainforests
and in Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia.
What happens is if the tree gets damaged somehow, it gets a fungal infection.
And that works its way into the heartwood of the tree, where the tree fights back with extra resin production.
Okay.
And this battle goes on for centuries.
It produces this core wood, you know, and it's agarwood or aloe's wood.
And there is just nothing else that smells like when you burn this stuff.
It's the most complex aroma.
That's crazy.
Very, very unique.
It's the majority of what the smell in this is.
Oh, wait.
This may be the wrong stick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is Kumito Riyoko aloe's wood.
It isn't aloe's wood, but it's a way lower grade than what I was trying to pull out of there.
I'd gone to Kentucky and visited the Buffalo Trace distillery.
That was cool.
It would have been closed, but I happened to show up just as Toyota was coming in with two buses that they'd chartered and had gotten an arrangement to have a tour of the place and just walked up to the crowd and followed them through.
Nice.
Oh, wow.
They've got this warehouse that was built in 1881.
It's got, I think it might be 2,300 barrels.
Maybe it was more than that, but it's five stories of open brick exterior and then just timber inside racks holding all these things.
And the smell of all of this whiskey evaporating through the barrels is just unbelievable.
You get downwind of this building and it's like, oh.
Okay, but does it smell like whiskey then?
Yeah.
Okay, so that's the stuff.
This is the situator.
That's hard to smell.
Oh, wow.
Wow, that's got a sort of a weird deep kind of like undertone, but then it's got like this sort of sweet thing on top.
Someone said that it smells hot without being spicy.
So how do you know about the instances?
Have you actually gone over there and like research these trees or are you just reading stuff off the back of things and packages?
Reading material online, mostly.
Okay.
It's a hobby that's been brewing for a long time.
Well, it's kind of cool to know.
I started burning frankincense back in the 80s.
Oh, okay.
It was occasionally and then went for a lot of years without any incense.
And then I recently kind of got back into it because I smoked for too many years and then quit in 2000.
Okay.
And occasionally I still get the fidgety habit.
Right.
And lighting a stick and just rolling it around like that.
That's something burning in my hand and it satisfies my stupid habit.
I have don't smoke cigarettes and don't stay away from that, but works for me.
Well, see, that's cool because I was never really sure of that instance.
And I'm sure there is the faking since maybe, but I kind of always wondered if it was like, I don't know, real stuff that I was burning or if it was just like, you know, like produce.
Yeah, because there is a lot of the stuff is all pure raw ingredients.
And a lot of it is also perfume.
There are a few companies that very deftly combine things like that.
Diatsu is one of them to make something called Tokus and Tonka that is an incense containing French perfume.
And normally I just do not like perfume at all.
It's a headache.
And at first I hated the stuff, but then I started burning it outside.
And there was something about snowing it from 10-15 paces away on the wind.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, so how does it get stuffy in the apartment or the house or whatever, if you try to do that?
Sometimes they don't fade well either, right?
The sake of burning that fenugreek stuff in the car, because I just cleaned the car out.
And it's like that still has kind of a smell.
So I put a stick in there, sealed it all up and let it burn out and then soak into the car.
It was not a good result.
It probably seemed like a really good idea at the time, but it didn't smell like incense.
It smelled just like bad, stale smoke.
Have you ever smelled like just pure sage?
Yeah.
That's really good.
That could be all right.
Yeah.
I was shooting a movie in Oklahoma and we met this guy, a Native American who knew just about every niece that you could burn for a certain sort of experience or whatever.
Smudging.
That's what it's called.
Smudging is a burning, richly burning sage fungles usually and sometimes it's used to dispel a lethal or something.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, that's what he was talking about.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I've used that before, usually along with a Tibetan chant, whom Vajrape.
I'll do things whether I believe they work or not.
Sometimes it is an interesting trick.
That's a lot of magic has to do with just thinking it's going to work.
Yeah, yeah, true.
So what about slackware?
Oh, yeah, slackware.
How does that tie into this whole ritualistic burning of aromas?
Well, I do usually keep that going on my desk.
Yeah, so.
So there is a tie.
And it's, and I guess part of how I ended up knowing about that still, you know, how the incense is made and what not.
If something is compiling and I sometimes will not multitask and will go read stuff online.
Yeah.
I earn me out too much if I try to utilize myself at a hundred percent speed.
Yeah, yeah.
So I'll look at other stuff and incense is a big interest in music.
Yeah.
I should have brought my banjo here.
Oh, that would have been cool.
Yeah, banjo.
Play banjo.
Play banjo.
That'd be cool.
I play, um, I don't play, but I'm trying to learn like some guitar.
Yeah, I play guitar.
Yeah.
I mean, it's kind of a garciish noodling.
Oh, cool.
It's like when my, sort of like, actually, garcias kind of, I mean, I don't know that many guitar.
Like rock guitarist.
I don't, I'm not that much of an aficionado.
But like when I hear him doing the guitar, I always kind of, I can tell it's him.
You can know.
Sometimes one note is all it takes and it's something about the way you grab the string.
And it's like, oh, that's chair.
Yeah.
But yeah, that is, uh, he's probably got my biggest guitar influence.
And that's what I play is that nudily lyrical.
Oh, that's cool.
Totally improvised as much as possible.
And that's the struggle that you continually have to play.
Any type of jazz music is to, uh, purge yourself of the canned riffs.
Yeah, yeah.
Or you get lazy and emit them.
And everyone does.
You would hear Garcia do it too.
He had a few things that he would fall back on.
Whether he tried to avoid that or not.
I don't know.
Oh, you know.
Well, I mean, some of his jams are just unbelievably just like, I wish they would never end.
You know, what is like?
You know, it's weird for me about the dad and none of the other jam bands.
It's ever really fully capsuted for me.
Is this feeling that they're not thinking any farther ahead than the note that they're on?
And then the whole band gets into the same headspace.
Yeah.
And that is just odd, dude.
Yeah, it really is.
Well, I don't know.
I've been interested in things like jack as a possible addition, depending on how much, uh, structure that would add.
I'm not interested in the pole audio, but the jack would be good to have.
I have to say, it's really great doing multimedia on Slackware.
And that's having come for me from Mac OS 10 as my main platform.
And then trying to find a Linux distribution that could do multimedia solid, you know.
And finding that sure enough, it was Slackware, the little distra that I'd start with at like version, I think 12.1 is my climate fan.
So fairly new to it.
But, you know, it's.
It was a while ago.
Yeah.
Actually, and that is something that I've been wanting about, I guess, because my impression is that Slackware releases fairly infrequently so that it can remain stable and try to true.
Or is it more like because you don't multitask it enough?
No, it is a case where the way that development occurs is that by its nature, you have to start slowly.
I mean, we're working right now towards Slackware next.
Yeah.
And I want to get pernels up and stuff like that.
But you've got to do the dangerous things early on and let them just kind of soak.
Okay.
And then, as it is, you just can kind of feel that the release is coming.
It's a real intuition that I will not say at any point, oh, our next release will be this November 14th.
We're going to put out Slackware 14.0.
Right.
I wouldn't do that because I don't know what the state of affairs will be and there's really no way to predict.
It's something that Mad Dog said to me that it stuck with me.
It's just so much easier to swim downstream.
And it's true.
You could just fight the way everything is coming along and try to change it, but I try just not to.
Yeah.
And it is a case by the end of the Devcycle.
It's a race to catch up and to keep caught up.
And there is no way to do that early on.
Yeah.
So that's what happens.
Yeah.
But this is, so this is your first Southeast Lilland Sunday Fest.
Yeah, I know.
What, why are you here?
Robbie and the other guys, I guess, they're excited about this.
It's kind of the home turf.
Yeah.
There's several slackers here who I have not met in person.
I don't know.
And that's V-Bats.
Yeah.
David Samarro.
Oh, okay.
And I'll say, and Dev Rob Zero, people I never had face time with.
Yeah.
And that is an important thing.
You can't do it all.
It is kind of cool, right?
Yeah.
You got it.
You got to go and see people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't been to a Linux conference in a long time.
Really?
I was going to have.
I was going to have.
In 2008.
Do you know that I was actually there as well, but I was, I had just gotten into Linux, I think.
And I was way too shy to talk to people.
So you and a podcaster named Chess Griffin, who I used to have seen two of us.
Yeah.
S-B-O-P-K-G.
And I think someone else was there.
Oh, Dave Yates, the guy who actually sort of is the mastermind of this festival.
And I was.
And I was talking to you at the bar, or at least hung out in proximity.
Yeah.
We very well may have.
So it's kind of funny, but.
Because it seems like I talked to almost everyone there.
It was a large crowd.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you're probably right.
But that's the funny thing about, I guess, Linux.
And I'm sure a lot of people say this a lot of times.
But you know, you've got these people who basically affect your daily life.
Because you're using software that they have developed.
Or a collection of software that they put together for you.
And they're normal people.
You know, and they turn out not to be like intimidating or mean.
Yeah.
Or too famous to be bothered.
Yeah.
Just like.
I don't know how to handle a lot of that, which is part of why I'll stay.
Yeah.
I don't want to be told that.
Oh.
You've affected my life.
I don't mind.
I don't mind it.
I guess I am.
I do like to hear someone say, you know, everything has been better and completely different
because of this.
I never would have known about any of this.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's so pretty cool.
That's.
You look happy.
Not again.
That's.
How are you?
I'm talking to you because I know you make you cringe up.
Yeah.
You can see I try to hide that.
It's only for the software.
Where did you come up with the GPL version?

Eugene off the local station it didn't have any kind of a relay that was terribly far and it was very good
quality so good that when I put this patch on I sent the one track back and was like here I got
a fix for you and they're like where did you get this? I patched it for my FM that we couldn't even
hear the patch. The guy said it was the cleanest it was. I probably threw away a bit more of the
board tape that I could have. I had shopped about 10 seconds of their board signal
away to find a better place to hide the slice. Yeah as long as the slice got hidden I mean that's
okay. It's not missing anything. It's taking 10 more seconds from FM but it worked out. Yeah that's
cool. There's a Stella Blue reporting. I think it was with Jerry Garcia band and it's like 16 minutes
long. If you ever encounter that well that's the one to listen to. I don't remember Jerry band
doing Stella but it's possible. It might not be. It might have just been the dead. I was there for
the last performance of Stella Blue and that version June 28th of 95 in St. Louis somewhere near
St. Louis. He has the most emotional almost break down at the end of the song. More so than
usually he really went with it. Wow. Yeah that's a wow. Yeah that's really cool. Shivers down the
spine just to think about that. Yeah a lot of very odd moments on that last tour of the tour from
hell and we all somehow I think we knew this was coming. Yeah I think that there was there was
a realization. Another thing that is very odd is that as early as the mid 80s there was some sort
of understanding among the dead heads that there was going to be at the last show they would do
Unbroken Chain and the last song they would ever play was Boxer Rain and we knew that. I don't
know how we knew that but we were right. They had never played Unbroken Chain live. It came out
in 1973 and they started playing it early in 95. It did get played at the last show. The last
Jerry song for the encore was Black Muddy River which is also almost like it is almost like okay
I have to go off the die now. I'm very strange and then Phil just to take some into Boxer Rain
they almost never did a double encore and they did. It was like weird stuff that I later tried
to go see and it was like did anyone write this down in advance or did it was this just like some
bit of collective or that we can't prove we knew this ahead of time. Well we can't. Do you
remember what else was going on at that time? What was going on in the world? You know what I mean?
Was this just a grateful dead thing? Was it just the grateful dead coming to an end or whatever?
Yeah for me the period of time that strikes me as
normal novelty and everybody seems to have some kind of agreement. What I've talked about this
is spring of 96. I don't know what happened then but
odd stuff occurred in spring of 96. Do you know much about the
I'm sure by now you could not possibly have avoided this 12-21-12 thing. Well naturally right yeah.
We were following that in the 80s as well and a book that was out then called The Invisible Landscape
that was written by Dennis McKenna and Terence McKenna and talks about how they discovered somehow
they had gone down to Brazil, went to the the rainforest and with the natives did some sort of
native psychedelic mushrooms for like a month they just remained and they said that they had
conversations with an alien insectoid intelligence who told them about this 12-21-12 thing and that it
was actually because time does not run in the direction we think it does and that's where that's
where the beginning point is and that it's emanating backwards and why that would be I can't think
of any good reason for that but then then okay now I'm going to prove it to you and here's how it
works and shows them all of this math and the all of the hexagrams of the eaching. Have you ever
used that or heard much about that? Well me Philip K Dick wrote the whole man in the high tower
based on the eaching. He actually let that guy the story. Oh so he would ask the eaching where
the story was to go well that would probably work really well. I don't bother the oracle unless
I have a real question because it tends to give you your answer whether you like it or not and
I don't think I've ever had that fail on me but yeah the something about the sequence of the normal
king when when sequence of hexagrams then can be made into this wave and when superimposed
and this 12-21-12 thing is weird too because it was another spring in 96 this is going to get
me in trouble talking about this crap but spring in 96 I'm not quite sure what happened
you know I want like temporarily nuts and I came up with that same date they've never really you
know paid attention I think that the invisible landscape as a book came to my attention
around man really it was a friend of mine who was reading it back from the 80s and what not
and brought it to my attention like in April or May of 96 after I'd already been toying with that
and had had thought that there was something weird too about 12-21-12 that there's only two numbers
and it's almost like half-assed binary and it began to look at it well no it's really 0-1-1-0-0-1
which is what I think that's what Bender rattles off and the is it 0-1-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1
the whole concept of the time wave zero is that novelty is some sort of an essential force of
the universe the opposite of entropy and it comes and goes like a tide and as the wave approaches
the zero line things get stranger as it goes back up things get more normal and follow old patterns
when they took this thing they didn't know quite where to apply it and they started looking for
historical events to to match it to figure out where to put this thing and found
you know huge dips around like the end of World War Two and the bombs got dropped
and all of it ended up leading to this date and then there's that whole Mayan connection to it
right right and that was something I used when I I should have saved that but slackware
13.0 if you look in the slackware version etc slackware version it says it's version 13.0.0.0.0.0 that's the
that is the Mayan date for the rollover after 12 2012 my my GPG key also expires on 12 21 12
I've had that key since 98 or something yeah yeah I had to I had to figure out how to
force PG or GPG to generate that so that it would expire on that day so do you think that time
is linear I mean you personally I'm not sure if I believe in time in any fashion that
in a lot of ways it's an illusion caused by you know our motions and whether whether there even
is such a thing other than the present moment I'm not sure I'm convinced of yeah well did you ever
hear that but maybe I am maybe in fact I would think almost of time and space as we know it as
really being like a crystal that is very solid and does not move it just looks like it yes from
our perspective of being in different parts of it I don't know what I guess sort of a mantra I
guess or something but it's like um to what is it not my own ring of kill probably to move
is to suffer or move it through movement come suffer or something like that the inverse of that
basically being still actually avoid suffering and I always thought that that was like incredibly
simple if you just take it for what it says although I am translating it so I don't know exactly
what it says but at least to my English ears it sounds like movement causes suffering and it
makes sense if everything is still no one suffers if you ignore all sensory input to manage to
steal your thoughts that is an extremely extremely interesting place yes and it is infinite vast
without suffering I haven't actually been able to get quite in there's a certain level of voidness
that is very difficult to achieve and I think my meditation have to go a lot farther it is not
existing and also not not existing you have to be between those two states and
and really undefined well do you focus on like a single point when you're meditating or do you like
when when I have had success it is a lack of focus it is letting go of your thoughts
it is like a relaxation of your mind and like your hand twitching around like this it just
finally going on and just letting it stop it's not for me even possible to reach a point where
I don't have consciousness but it has been possible to reach a point where that is all there is
and there is no character to it other than its simple existence it kind of makes me think that
maybe the consciousness that we all have is emerging out of a shared baseline that we're sort of
players for the consciousness of reality we're like a tape deck moving along and playing the
latent background noise which is aware of itself now that I like latent background noise because
I love latent background noise because like we were saying earlier this is the brain the my notion of
physics and metaphysics it's not impossible to conceive that all this happens exactly the way
it was but there is no consciousness and no one who's really watching the old coin about the tree
the tree files in the forest and there's no one there to hear it doesn't make a sound no because
it doesn't even exist it has to be observed nothing can happen the whole universe without some
observation at least this is where I'm getting I think my understanding of reality I think a rock
is at least conscious of being a rock and sits there in kind of a similar state to some of the
meditation I would try for and hope to get I mean to actually get things to quiet just really quiet
maybe half a dozen times of hold on I've had one time I had a very vivid vision of
goddess like it was like an elephant goddess like a female Ganesha wearing these flowing
robes that were covered in text that looked very much like Hindi and was in constant motion it was
constantly rewriting itself and even though I couldn't read it I could it was all beaming some
information straight into my brain wow and yeah it was a very odd thing I was just trying to get
the quiet again I ended up some place and that was very strange yeah and that's and that's not
quite because you're getting information with the same thing yeah yeah I don't know when
Hinduism of an elephant goddess I did try to look online and found at least one other person
describing what sounded like the exact same thing if you can really get all the synopsis just
with the world I have to think that that space has got some tangent to death
yes it is a way rich and for some it's like if you know if you were a computer and you were running
if you're interested in something you should be exposed to it so I had a lot of connections with
people at universities in the area but yeah they had some sort of a PDP running an early BSD
over there and it had the whole lineup of the BSD games and this guy brought me to see the computer
and I got to play with lasers holograms we'll see the computing facilities at all the different
universities but especially play with a unix command line at the age of like six or seven and
after that I got more into the more personal computer type built a calculating device based on
relay is when I was in third grade that had toggles to set this off and could be hardwired with a
program that ended up getting into the science fair there was for much older children than going
all the way to states but not winning there but having them go huh oh there was some jealousy
that this kid was there because at some point before the event someone wouldn't hold all the
layers off the top oh you serious yep so I came back to my thing and it's hard code was gone yeah
they erased it but it was erased well whatever yeah when I had an Atari 2600
was interested in that I guess wanted to get things like the basic programming thing wanted to
get a time X in Claire at the point when those first came out it was like you want a computer for
$99 dollars that was like the greatest deal in the world but ended up with an apple too okay
still have it it was overclocked from one to ten megahertz
so I got it all that but I always liked units I actually ended up running with something
called hyper C on the apples you that had a unique slight command line environment in an
integer C compiler oh wow okay and so that kept me as well with you know so it was it I mean
there was a real C compiler yeah it was well it was not it was I mean not standard it was
integer C it couldn't handle floating point at all and it had to you know only have
substantive of the functions but you could do programming with it yeah it was interesting
and it was a compiled language which was rare to have a true compiled language in an apple too
almost everything was interpreted even though the so-called compiled things were usually a
piece system or something and we've compiled to P code and then run that in a P code interpreter
yeah when I got to yeah like my second or third college the one I finally graduated from one of my
profs in an artificial intelligence class had us using Lisp and I hated the Lisp interpreter
that he had for us to use which was for DOS and it was just garbage yeah and that was my
initial interest in Linux I had already been kind of interested about it I heard about it
at a Christmas party at a screen printing company in December 1992 and when that's when it kind
of went it first came out yeah 91 was but by then it was beginning to work yeah okay and
H.J. Lee was bootroot disk was available then early versions of SLS were out yeah and that was
what I ended up pulling down MCC plus TAMU SLS a bunch of these different early distributions
and yeah trying the modern name back then yeah TAMU was just because of people developing it
we were at Texas A&M okay MCC because it was the Manchester Computing Club in England okay
that started to make little bit more sense yeah but so I needed something we could do less
and SLS shipped with sea lisp so I was like all right I'm in business and pulled that down and
then started poking around the environment and discovered you know that it was trouble it didn't
want to install right it didn't get all these other problems and it was him telling me you know
I'd really like to give the people in like class this and say here use this as a Lisp it's a
better Lisp and closer to common Lisp and so on and it's like but it doesn't want to install and
it's got all these bugs so I'm like let me see what I can do about that nice yeah and by the time
then I was like here here you go you can it's ready to go you can have it then other people are
going to want this I should just you know put it up for FTP or something and would not ever have
thought that you know within and I will continue to work on it for 17 years yeah really I know
that's what bizarre I thought that I'm going to put this out and I really thought that Peter or
McDonald SLS was going to go oh I better diff my stuff against this and find these fixes and
roll them in but it really happened and uh quickly I had people who were like relying on me it
became a support issue very early on that people needed help and they needed it to keep working and
you better keep doing this because we need this wow that is so okay I guess I you know my
calling has found me so with so I mean you don't do Lisp much anymore I'm sure no really so it's
just CLS that you were working on yeah okay and uh was Emax not or I mean that I think of Lisp
before I think of Emax I don't even think it ever occurred to me to try to use Emax or even
I I'm not entirely sure how to execute Lisp within Emax I'm really not much of an Emax user okay
but uh and I'm not even a vim user I use Elvis which is why that's still linked to Vex
I don't I don't want uh something to color things in and I also don't like uh
occasionally if I'm having a problem and I really cannot find it visual inspection I will
load it into Vim to see what Vim has to say about it but um see there but Vim also has a habit of
sometimes picking up like Easter Oaks and going into weird modes I don't understand yeah and
and V.I. is more like your Elvis is more like the old V.I. I remember so what about you are you
an Elvis of V.I. or a Emax? Vim Vibats Vibats is Vibats thinks I should change that simlink
well there's a deal most people probably think I should change that simlink
I like the simlink I like I like I do think that is the default thing I don't need to do this
thing I think I've got a box I know there's a box somewhere that's the actually just as Vim
it's one of my arm machines but if you I forget exactly what I have to look at it can be but you
can say to your Vim RC that it behaves more sanely than that default thing yeah it's it's more like
a traditional V.I. it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't get you know sometimes you don't need all this
in tech or highlighting and although it's just to ship the real deal I think I did have N.V.I.
in there at maybe an extra years ago probably before I might just sit and head up
I don't know Jesus yeah it could be just so are they still like
all of her did the education and open source
and it's all guinea there's like I'm staring at a god man
oh yeah it's like that until I do it with the lucky charm shoes
no yeah yeah that's a guy
he's like he's like the inter usb commercial he's really mostly a normal person
everyone is a famous person in their own movie
and so I was scared to come over here I didn't know
I'm like I don't know how you're so young that's my big thing I expected like
well how how old do you know do you think I am
slapper has been around since like what like 1960s or 30s yes I can't remember
huh are you still recording this I wouldn't have said anything
haha well I mean I you know how I know I don't I don't I don't represent reality
I don't actually I'm just a random person here we have Patrick sent this to me
haha I'm glad I was so recording
like the first time I heard this I mean I I don't think I've ever heard
the the same that that sound quality except maybe like you say from a
dad but then I've never had a dad a portable dad who out in the world so naturally it's
going to sound good in the studio and then you're like you know this thing you can just
carry around yeah I had I had mics made by a place called a chorus sound I don't know if you ever
heard of them the guy makes bullet mics there in 22 casings and and have little alligator clips
in the back of them and you can you know put them on your hat and manage to stealth record
that right but they're very high quality it's got a the well the good ones are the the
cheap ones don't have any battery box but the good one has got phantom power nice and the mics
are just no real self noise to speak of yeah I took that thing and set it out next to a pond in
upstate New York where there are about a bazillion bull frogs doing their thing and let it take and
that is that is an interesting recording to put on it's like you're just in the middle of it
all these come by
they built it to a dream
a broken angel sing from a guitar
yeah there's just the song
it's crying like the wind
yeah
do
it's still a blue
When all the cards are down There's nothing left to see
There's just a painted man and proper dreams
The end is just a song
It's crying like a cat
You're all alone, that's ever been
Still alone, still alone
I've stated every move that she fucks down
And we'll try it
That's not the first escape, it's just a plot box
I'm gonna make a shot
That's not the first escape, it's just a plot box
That's not the first escape, it's just a plot box
It all rolls into one
And nothing comes to free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song
I'm crying like a wind
It seems like all this line was just a dream
Still alone
Still alone
Still alone
Still alone
Still alone
Still alone
