Hello everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio
Community News for March 2013. Joining us today from the top are Dave Morris with a
bit the frog and he threw it. Sorry about that. Not a problem Dave. Myself Ken Fallon.
Need a media here? Osama's just listening.
And Urugami is also listening from what I can tell. So that's it for now.
First of all, as we always do, I'd like to welcome some new hosts to the show and this month
we have had four new hosts, John Culp, Blackro, Steve Bickel and Christopher M Hobbs and I think
that's a very nice addition to the HPR community to have those guys come online so I'd like to
welcome all of you. Now briefly we do a quick show review of shows that have been on over the
last month and first up after the community news was John Culp with HPR 1197 what I do with
bash scripts. I find these immensely interesting. I would not go so far as to say as he said how
that you might think it's boring for people to list bash scripts. I in actual fact do find
bash scripting in audio very interesting. Anyone get a chance to listen to this?
Yes, yes I enjoyed that one. I thought John had done it some fantastic work I had. I was tempted to
write to him which I did and just to say great stuff John and we had a little chat about bash
scripting. So yeah I thought he'd done a great job and I liked his presentation as well.
Yeah very nice work there. I'd actually like to hear more detailed episode on Latex it seems to be
I don't have any experience with it but all the documents I've seen out there on Latex are very
very clean professional looking documents so if there's any Latex experts out there listening to
the show we'll should add that to the requested topics if I remember.
I'm going to say Latex expert. I'm also referring to Latex. Anybody who has any experience whatsoever
is also fine. This is why this is why the people that use it pronounce it latte.
Excellent. There we have Latex latte for a moment. I didn't have used it quite a lot actually in
the past. The university has to work for used it as the method for students to produce reports
for many many years so but it's all forgotten it all now I'm afraid. Well it seems everybody
on the back channel here seems to be saying that they've used this so I expect a plethora of
shows in the queue on Latex. Anyways the following day a welcome return to one of my favorite
producers of audio drama and that is Mr. Lost and Bronx. The author of the imagination 05
discussing among other things in audio fast track and basically a series of internet archive
episodes and his favorite shows much of which I will download and listen to.
And as if this is as if like a boss all-time radio shows the following day we had episode 1199
Frank Bell with all-time radio on the web another cacophony of links to his favorite all-time
radio shows. It's actually fantastic. I like this sort of idea. I don't know if any of you guys
have seen the Raspberry Pi hack where a chap took a old you know an old radio and turned it into
like a time machine when you turned the dial you could tune from radio shows from the internet
archive and you could go forward and back in time with the other dial. That's cool yeah. So
Raspberry Pi stuck inside and then he just changed the two dials so that it was
went to the various NBC or whatever. I don't know what the radio stations were on the main dial
and then as you turn the volume or one of the other buttons up and down it would you know go from
the from World War 1 chills World War 2 the whole way up here but World War 1 I don't know about
was pretty awesome. Then we had Black Crow joining us with a what I think is going to be an
excellent and very difficult subject which would be a computer jargon explained basic premises
he wishes to put up a website which will explain in clear terms non-technical terms what
things like DNS are for example. So if there's anyone there who is of interest who has interest in
helping along with this get in touch with Black Crow details and the show notes. Steve Bickle
joined us for first episode on what's in my feed and of course some classic webcomics xkcd
Gilbert and some other ones that I hadn't heard of so he also went through some of the music shows
that you listen to and then went on to give us a tip on secure copy which is one of my favorite
applications that an SSHFS I like excuse me I'm listening my voice here and I thought it was a
great episode that I loved the way he punctuated the sections with music he I think he said he
he'd recorded it in sections and then he put little bits of little bits of music in between as
although it's very professional very well done to make you learn from yes but my shows to shame but
I feel that my shows are are setting the you know the the the bar solo that anybody else can go
anyway the next day we had Dan the man with the BC command and finally somebody is able to bring
some enlightenment as to what the BC command is and what it does because he said eluded me for many years
I've used it I have used it but the version I used had nowhere near as many features as the one
Dan was describing so yeah it's amazing it's astonishing thing I have even some scripts that
use it but mostly it's like copy and paste stuff when I tried to read the man page I just got
completely and totally lost yeah yeah every stuff the following day was a welcome return to one
of my favorite podcasters chess-driven griffin who I live in hope that he will return with
with Linux reality revisited but that was a show called Templar static HTML generator written
in pearl Dave yes I listened I looked I haven't haven't loaded it yet but I'm going to go hunting
that one looks like no it's good the guy who wrote it lives in Edinburgh just just where I do so
does he know he does he does yeah yeah if all of you there was somebody who walked down with a
never-fornish over the face well you never know you never know I'll have to have to see if I can
find some way of doing that very thing no promises regardless it was great to hear from Chess again
and this is you know it's one of these I think 5150 type shows that I don't have any particular
need for right now but I suspect I may have in the future yeah yeah it's the way I feel as well
I'd like to like to check check out check out what he was telling us about see what I can do with it
and the next day was 1204 my magnitude downloader by mr. Dave Morris himself and so tell us about
this why why you it's I made notes on this I wrote seemed a bit on reflections seemed a bit weird
and idiosyncratic I just tend to write scripts to do do bizarre things just because I like doing it
that way but I'm not sure anybody else would see it quite the same way I do yeah I I was very impressed
to this and you basically described my approach my approach to it everything you everything you
said was perfectly the most perfect logical sense so I don't know what that says about all Steve
well yeah yeah I can't comment but yeah good one well you're not alone thanks very much I must
so I need to do a show on XML Proxsoon and I've been using XSLT quite a lot of work and the
beginning to enjoy it so whenever I begin to enjoy something I should really do a show on
yeah it's it's a lot more powerful than you you might imagine isn't it it's amazing things
you can do with it provided of course the XSL is well-formed indeed indeed this is another discovery
I made along the way yes and a discovery that we also met for doing that download the Linux link
.net podcast oh yes yes yes by the way if I'm not mistaken the HTML tidy package I think would be
able to fix up the HTML as most web browsers would render it the incomplete HTML so that might
just fix your problem with which with the XSLT proc and give you the ability to continue on yeah it's
not so much that but if they're missing required elements entirely then there's not really a lot
you can do yeah go on sorry I think maybe we should create a different episode about this and
continue on with with the episodes of the that has been yeah absolutely in fact needle can you
give me a reminder or an email or something later on to discuss that because if you have tips on
getting that Linux.net thing to be able to parse through those files it will be very very
advantageous but as you say we'll we'll we'll take it off anyway 12.5 talk to me news for
the news team is back and it's great to see a very very healthy community arising over there
on the tgtm newscast the next show was 12.06 resolving issues with the vhost config file and
contrary to what the guy says I was not overturning tables that much showing this show it was
interesting to hear people debugging debugging virtual host I've been there I've done that and
learned a few things on as we went. Yeah the whole patch of configuration file is really something
you need to have seen a few times and seeing it fail a few times before you really get what's
going on in the way it's working. Absolutely do you work with a patchy a lot? Yeah we have a few
servers on the on network which use it and I have it on my own server so yeah I know the
configuration file quite well actually. That folks sound very much like somebody volunteering to
talk about a patchy configuration. If you'll be there to listen sure no problem. You know I'm
always there to listen. Oh actually for such a session actually a good plan. I think the only
jumped out of me on that was the need to restart. I would tend to use the Apache control
to restart it but other than that and to check the config as well. The next day was ice cast
101 by our good friend and fellow alien Tlatu and I will say to Tlatu why he hadn't this done
before the new year show is beyond me because all this stuff I had to learn in a few hours before
the HVR community news or the HVR new year show but it was fantastic and nice episode and I know
I'll be going back to it and the good news is it's part one of the series so we'll get to here and
see if he has resolved some of the issues that I've run into and still haven't problems fixed for.
Then we went into those requests on the mailing list at the notification that there were quite a
lot of people going to the northeast Linux vest which was a Jonathan the extravaganza and held in
Harvard University around Paddy's weekend and we had a series of shows bumped to the top of the
queue for that and it was interesting for me to see how the new queueing logic system was working
during this whole thing. Anyone have any comments to say it on this? Well from my point of view
congratulations to NY Bill and Pokey for the work they did having tried to do an interview recently
which I think I failed at. I very much appreciate the work they must have put in there. Fair
bit of sweat and tears getting all that a lot done I think. I particularly have noted with
interest the concept of a Ken Fallon style interview but I did love their interview with
John Maddokal and I know Pokey has said it a hundred times but I could just listen to that guy
talk over and over and over and over again I'd never get tired of hearing him talk.
Now I agree and they seem to have had a fantastic boot there were what the four or five maybe
six different HPR people on the boot? Yeah I'm impressed. Very absolutely no organization for me so
this to me is proof of the health of HPR at the minute that people pick up stuff and just go and do
it and organize the banners and organize the things to be sent from one place to the next they
organized to have a new recorder available that's just recently been added to the kit. They've got
you know different banners they've got the tablecloth they've got the printed off QR codes
and apparently stickers although I did not see any of the stickers but I would like to have
and I felt that the coverage they get they got from it I really got a feel like you were kind of
there and experience things something like I hoped that my coverage of our camp was was trying
to do at least I definitely got the feel that I was there on the booth with the guys.
And the following day we had Becky doing the Tokiq to me news and then after that we had done
with units command something that I had never seen before. I'd seen it but I never never quite got
my head right as you said with BC it's one of those things that you look at the man page and go oh
and close it up and go away which is what I did but yeah Dan opened up the doors there a wee bit
for me so yeah I'm a big bad I'm a bit concerned by what you know he gave quite a lot of warnings
that it seems to have its own esoterical type of of command layout. Did you look at the config file
that Dan mentioned? No it's got more units in there than you ever thought existed in the world
it's just astonishing. Yes yeah I didn't know there was a barn and a shade units in physics yeah
apparently in physics. I don't know what the hell they are but they do exist.
I don't know okay. I'm going to by the way just as a reminder for people again just if you're new
to HPR the Linux link sorry Linux in the shell.org if you go to the website we only include the first
little segment of the blog post and there's a complete worked out blog post so if you are
inter if you find it easier to read he has a complete worked out blog post and he's also got
videos where he walks through screencasts of everything that he does I would strongly advise people
to look at all of these. I tend to bunch them up and watch them in a go this month I've been
quite busy at work so I haven't had a chance to view them yet but I'll get to it.
Then we had Mr David Whitman who's been unable to join us today with an interview about Linux
Fest Northwest and interview with Jakob Perry and just so you know it is to be held on April 27th
28th it's also on our events events round up in the show notes for this episode so go and check that
out and we will also be covering some of these in next month's show but I just want to make a special
mention of Christopher Hobbes, Christopher Hobbes paraprogramming which was a whirlwind introduction
to paraprogramming it's been that's hurtles and practices and just if you haven't heard us this
is absolutely nothing to do with Pearl while it could have but it has nothing to do with fruit
that is it any nor does it have anything to do with with the I think there was some sort of
compiler or I'm mixing that up with Parrot Dave help me out. Are you thinking of pairing in PHP
or something? Yes that's the one thank you thank you thank you. What is that you do with the
coding in Teams so quite an interesting episode but we'll discuss that now next month so that
everybody on the on the call has a chance to read listen to the episodes.
Okay that was it so basically there's a few announcements that I want to make about it's been a
very busy month on the mailing list normally it's like you know a reminder that you're part of
the mailing list for this month it's been all drama it's been like a soap opera by times
now I met the mention earlier that the I met the mention of first before I go on Nido has just
said that next week the session isn't going ahead or he's not available for it so but I think
that dude man has something planned. Well I just want to say that I this month has been a lot of
test cases for the new scheduling rules and for those that don't know what the new scheduling rules
are they basically are reserve shows then schedule slots and then it works out shows with the
longest release date. So what happened this month is there was the Northeast Lennox Fest with a lot
of holes there and they had the opportunity to interview a lot of people so for two reasons we
have agreed on the mailing list there's quite a long discussion previously about that where
if somebody is going to take the time to go to a show and represent HPR after they're on
the room pocket then they should get reserved a block of five shows within two weeks of the event
happening and I think that worked out fantastic well the HPR coverage was out before most of the
other shows had a chance to comment on the Northeast Lennox Fest so I think we achieved that goal
and anybody who was interviewed during the process of that has had the chance to you know join HPR
and hear their episode being released and talked about and that the enthusiasm hasn't waned and
perhaps we'll we'll get some shows as a result of that and I also think it was really give us the
feel of yeah this is what one part of our community is doing and and that kind of worked out well
what it did do was it pushed the Toki Timi News show which would normally come out on the Friday
on to the following Tuesday which pushed down Lennox in the shell and then we had a request
from Dave Whitman who had put a he had an interview as well heads up about the Lennox Fest
Northwest show which notified the the mailing list and nobody objected to it and that came out
on 1214 and then the following day was a new host and that was Christopher and M Hobbs who had
been waiting quite a while so thanks for your patience there Christopher but I think it for me
it works out quite well because it's keeping things nice and spicy but one thing that does
concern me is that the 5150 had a lot of shows in there that were kind of morally submitted onto
the old rules if you know what I mean and that would be you know whoever submitted the show first
would get a show and then you know actually one show we can tell their shows are used up so I
will beg your forgiveness of people if I put out 5150 some of 5150 shows ahead of other people's
just so we can get those cleared out we also have quite a few shows from Ahuka but I have his
permission to let those dribble out over the summer when he might be a way doing something else
so they will come out naturally but I just really want to address 5150 shows because it has been
concerning me over the last month that an injustice may have been done.
This month made some significant changes to they read me file and it's up to version 9 now
and I also introduced a sample show notes page which is in HTML which cleverly introduces
some things like a show title priority, episode tag explicit a short summary for Twitter
and stuff like that none of which are supported by the database so yes as we as we go along we will
see how we'll support those in the back end but don't don't be afraid to put them in now and we
will retrofit them into into the system at the end but it's also it was kind of good for me to be
able to write down on a sample show note page what I would like to see and going forward what we
need and what we wouldn't want to support in an upload form for instance and then obviously if
we have an upload form we need to support it in the database or some form storage in the back end.
Some things that have been added to the show notes has been if you can add your
host ID and you'll find your host ID on the contribute page and if you just prefix its minus
30 and then so I will go 30 underscore can fallen underscore blah blah blah blah show about blah
dot flac for flak and then my show notes will be exactly the same file name dot html and what
really really helps is what is helping me a lot is the people who are adding tags using something
like kid3 to their flak when they export it you can also add them in audacity and the exact format
of the tags is correct is laid out there you don't need to put the quotes in just so the title
will be whatever you call your show the album will be hacker public radio without the quotes the
artist is your is your handle and the genres podcast and the comment is should start to add html
column 4 slash 4 slash hacker public radio dot org and then whatever show notes you want to put
in or not it's up to you and doing that has really saved me a lot of time I'm currently using
kid3 but Dave I want to use your tool for extracting the flak the tags from flaks and double them in
to into web og and speaks actually can you just make that happen hi thanks oh yeah yeah the the
tool I gave you is is tailored for for my needs so what you want is something a bit more generic so
we can we can come up with something sure yeah no problem cool because I think we're very close
now to doing a lot of the automation that's that we have discussed at length on devlet
mailing list and before having the files like this and doing the workflow manually I know we
had a very long episode Dave and I had a long episode about this I'm doing the workflow manually is
is the bits that need to be automated are being highlighted and other stuff is not proving as
important for example the release reserved by release date or reserved by show number it's
kind of more important to know that they're being reserved for some reason but okay that's
neither here nor there neither here nor there some changes have been made to the back office which
has greatly helped me out and that is the website and feeds are now being released at midnight
it was midnight pst which is minus eight hours and you took never ending nagging complaining but
from people at scottland in scottland mentioning no names it's mentioning no names whatsoever it is now
released at a UTC at least the last show has been so if you notice anything strange that should
still that will actually benefit me because then I'll get the shows in the morning as well and it
should hopefully still provide 51 50 with his on time schedule for his pod catcher and it's also
helped me quite a lot because it means that I can publish the show in the evening last thing you
know on the train going home and then I don't need to worry about it at night and if there are
shows that are queued up like this month I was able to post four shows in the queue on Tuesday and
they just come out every day until Friday and then I didn't have the constant you know pressure
to to release at a particular time and I can't release early and tomorrow I need to do something
that was kind of nice yeah that's great then and my bill has a size with pictures from the
the nordese linux fest which includes among other things something I haven't seen in a long time
which is a pint of juicy Guinness yes there was a lot of on the mailing list there was a lot
of discussions about nordese linux fest getting stuff ready and I heard on all the podcast that there
was that we won the prize for having the best sticker collection so if some of the guys have taken
photos of some of the stickers or have samples of the new stickers because I don't have those
I had the oval stickers but if you have any other stickers could you send me a samples because I
need to get some printed out for here on this side and as far as I know the booth is scheduled to go
to the north-east linux fest north-west if anybody else is going to an event between now and then
please get in touch and that is on April the 27th and 28th so if you have an a fest before the 27th
and 28th can you please get in touch with David Whitman links in the show notes and if you're
putting on if you're going to another event the ocp live i have no idea what that is
yeah they're they're show their website appears to be ocplive.com and they say it's going to be in
May and have no mention of venue date location place nothing not even continent it's on
so but anyway if you are going to an event representing hpr or not or whether you're going
at a table or not please get in touch and we'll add it to the list okay during one of the
discussions about the north-east linux fest a discussion come up about the fact that our mailing
list archiver is broken and I just realized that is the second time somebody has mentioned
that they will go to the mail list archiver and ours is frozen in time so on that list on that post
on that IRC channel there was a discussion about g main.org which is a free site a free open site
to archive mailing lists i've seen it before and it allows people to go back and look at the history
so i think it's actually perfect because then it's one last thing that i need to worry about
i'll set it up set it and forget it type thing and we can also import older messages and hopefully
i should be able to go through my own mailbox and import the missing messages
into that service so unless anybody has done the objection soon and that's we're going to
head and do that just given your heads up on the mailing list nobody seemed to mind anyway
and bear in mind that it was always the intention that the mailing list be public
then there was a massive discussion about what is a hacker and i hope needle that you have resolved
that issue for us um we have discussed about it at length that's uh that's true for sure however if
you're looking for like a dictionary definition of what is a hacker then i suggest you just find
yourself a dictionary because uh well that's also put into the show it was a interesting experience
not really what we were hoping for but uh interesting non-to-list it will be released soon i believe
yes look at the calendar dot php and you will uh see when it scheduled who knows who knows what's
going to happen with the schedule the way it is um but to me you're a hacker in the terms of
topic of interest hackers in terms of this network hacker is somebody who has clicked the link
to bring them to hackerpublicradio.org so that is the definition we are working on
hi as we have discussed that as well and we've included a link which has some interesting
the characteristics uh you've implemented some uh algorithms which would uh calculate whether
or not you are a hacker you could check the show and there's some link and if you go there then
you know the answer so it's quite easy actually cool i took a lot of work to put that together i can
i can assure you right um David is uh David Whitman that is is going to uh lynx fest north west
as has been said many many times in this uh episode so he asked if i will had a up-to-date
presentation uh that i had done i think uh two years ago now for okay camp and i went through
an update of that and if you have bear with me for a few moments i will go through the um the parts
of that that has changed since we discussed it last i am looking for a uh there was talk of
a presentation software i think uh door to door geek mentioned it um that was javascripts or
something and ideally i would like to have this presentation that it is at least regularly
updated via krone or something at the end of each month or you know that the hours minutes and
seconds are updated and the number of shows are updated automatically so that quite a lot of
this stuff wouldn't need to be um wouldn't need to be uh done manually but there we go
so the first part of the show is we are first part of the presentation is that we have changed
the um logos the first page is the new banner from um rf krone which is the community podcast
sharing your ideas projects and opinions new episode every weekday
then we have the linux format magazine and if you have any screenshots or photos of where
hiker public radio has been seen in print on brochures or something like that i would appreciate
if you could take a photo of our scan and send them to me that would be great hiker public
radio is a community network yet yet yet nothing changed there what has changed is that we're now
live seven years six months and 22 days from when today with a techie started on one day
October 10th 2005 and our rebranding occurred on the December 31st 2007 so seven years six months
and 22 days which brings us a total of 1,514 episodes when this will be presented and that's uh
300 today with techie shows and 100 uh 1,214 hpr shows which brings us to a total of 25 days 22 hours
and 30 minutes of continuous play which is approximately 498 audio CDs and if you want to be the
people who throw us over the 500 audio CD mark then you know you can submit a show here
to hiker public radio. our virtual length is 25 minutes 34 seconds and there are 23 gigabytes
of mp3 storage and we have pushed 35 terabytes of bandwidth now the monthly downloads is an
interesting statistic which i'll get on to later but for now i'll just give you the numbers
we have best approximation 16,090 daily subscribers and 79,640 monthly downloads so there's
quite a significant number of people who check the feed and then download manually we have updated
there are 240 shows and 266 shows a year, 178 free slots and 18 in the queue
and other than that the rest is more or less a rundown on how you can contribute and hasn't changed
links to the pdf and oDP are available in the show notes for this episode. i've been asked by David
again for he wants to produce a coffee cup which i hope he will send us photos of which would include
the hpr logo the bin rev logo and the lunar pages logo for use at the boot as he drinks coffee
on the hpr booth so if you are interested give him a shout and if you have good quality logos
he said we have the svg logo was requested by him and also requested by philip newbury
who is known more commonly as core nominal the husband and romantic partner this weekend
of bobobex and who is a member of the toky kimin news team and he is developing an android app
for a hacker public radio which will be released under free license or so he says and we look forward
to that it should include a record show now button which will be fantastic to see and we have a
requested topics page which i don't think we've been pushing enough i want to move it over it's
currently part of the country page it will be having its own page and i want people to be
conveniently able to submit requested topics so feel free as well to if you have an idea and
you're an identifier you can or twitter you can send us to the tag hpr and it will get to me
with your requested topic and when they put in there i know need or you requested a few topics
recently yeah i've added some things to the list and well if i'm totally honest the the shows which
i consider the best are the ones about topics which i haven't even heard about before so my
favorite topic is anything not on any of those or those lists excellent excellently put sir
excellently put however i have had a lot of people go well i don't know what to talk about
and if you don't go to the requested topics list otherwise drop me an email please and
we can have a mumble chat about whatever and i guarantee you i'll give you a list of 10 to 20 topics
that on something that you know about the rest of us don't um two just one thing need or say
as you're online the two of the topics that you requested have been covered but that i still see
that as not a reason to take them out of there so as we get the tagging and stuff going
i want to add the shows that have already been done on that and do some niceness
more in that later uh dude man was on the mailing list coming with part two of i love food
good food um how did that go ahead or didn't seem to it was supposed to be today and also next week
April 6th on our regular Saturday session which is recorded just before this session
yes we had no recording today because of some problems regarding item really sure because i can
reach him but um please just try to go on next week see what will happen that was more or less my
idea with the Saturday sessions uh there's this designated time at which you should go to the HBR
if you have something you want to talk about or if you just want to record a show but you don't know
how and uh hopefully there will be somebody around who can help you do it uh i won't be available
next week uh which is April 6th because i have other engagement but i'll be uh i'll be there
the week after that and but still if you want to do something on the sixth don't hesitate to use
the time just to go there and record and there's a countdown timer which needs a little bit work
on the main page so you'll always know when the next show has been recorded yet
all right no excuses folks no excuses the uh search was removed there's a whole series of stuff i
want to talk about now and uh the search was removed because i've been looking in the log file
quite a lot and looking at what's happening on the on the websites and it turns out that uh people
were attempting to use the search for naughty things so that was quickly removed and quite a lot
of the other um forms have been restricted to accept acceptable predictable input so for example
on the host page we would predict that you would be a host from an integer at least and a series
idea and stuff like that so it makes it easier to predict what's coming in there so we're not
accepting any old stuff from the internet that has resulted in certain people being added to a
deny list and that was put to they put to the mailing list if somebody does want to um help
a hacker public radio out from the point of view of securing the website then we can put up a
um a location for you to uh accesses and do security uh testing and you can even check the code
out which is that's not an issue if you are just randomly um attacking us for the sake of
attacking us then that is using resources according to the do guys and uh that is not uh considered
cool so um we have added you to a deny list and you will see a message coming up suggesting
that you should contact me to um to discuss that but i suspect quite a lot of people are just uh
it's just an automated script that's going around because i see the same ip addresses uh i see it
from the same ip addresses trying the same thing over and over again so um that was that as part of
security uh tightening the search option was removed and it was a request to have a search
option so i quickly added a google search to the top of the page which resulted in a um some
feedback from some members of the community who did not like the idea of having a search
page on the top of the page so then a doctor go was added and that led to some other members of
the community saying that the doctor could go had no uh that there were privacy implications with
google and that there we had nothing to say that's took to goes any better and we only had their
work first and they haven't contributed um code to the uh community so what i ended up doing was
the search is now on the uh side there's a search page and when you go to the search page you
can choose whichever search engine you use and when we get our own internal search solution
worked out um even if that's a hashtag um then uh a tag cloud which uh what was the 5150 said was
they uh i i remember some very funny comment about the uh the garbage at the side of the road
of the information super highway which i thought was quite amusing but uh as we make a that become
available we are looking at some solutions to sanitizing input and if they prove to be
um safe manageable and secure in double quotes then we might implement that for um the uh
comments as well and get rid of the current comments system which we have
um which brings me to the point that it is very difficult to um filter regular inputs coming
so um as part of the tightening up of stuff we have moved the FTP server from a page that was
available on the web server to somewhere internally that is not served by the web server so
therefore that prevents anybody who has access to the FTP site from putting up a webpage that
would take it that could be used for a cross site scripting attack and um i think it's
testament to our community that nobody has exploited that feature and we should be pulled them for
that but as a side effect of that and also the fact that the um shows are now being processed
in an automated fashion by the vps uh which is currently my machine but will be the vps um
they shows are not post public anymore um they have been taken off the FTP server process
and then put back also to a non um a page that isn't been served and the reasons for this is
two um we were getting quite a lot of four or four hits on those in fact 75 percent more
four or fours on the shows that were in the queue over the shows that were actually published so
those have been removed we did have a request from dudeman um to um make those
shows available um prior to the scheduling so that uh shows are not scheduled as shows become
available that they are immediately dumped out onto a feed and it was the it is the plan and
there exists code um for to put go max equals one and that will remove the limitations on the
rss feed um so it will give you everything regardless of what time it is so right now the
shows are limited to um the u gc time bear in mind if you do use that option
and i am publishing shows and i make updates or anything prior those are considered volatile
shows so it is on you're with great power comes great responsibility so if you do use that option
when it becomes available bear in mind that all those shows that are not released yet
will and can and may come down several times to your feed so it is up to you to
a live with consequences of that um but that's in the feed and um some of the things i wanted to
just give you a heads up about things that are currently been worked on and if you wish to offer
support uh some help on them we would appreciate that uh the automation of the presentation um if you
have needle what was that um javascript predisp javascript presentation to yes okay if there's a way
to produce a presentation either hcml or whatever uh automatically somebody has an experience
and that that would be nice the uh attempts to secure the website continues and the search
options will uh also be uh will the investigations will also continue i have started a um
taking some shots for a hpour introductory video which i might get chance to put together at some
point and and the show notes are the predecessor to an upload form which is uh which we can need
working we also need to get the atom feed working as well and we also need to get uh opus support
working so if we could get some feedback on people about what needs to happen for opus support
bear in mind though that we would then need to um see what the implications would be with regard to
storing 25 gigabytes of additional um files on the uh on the server so we'd have to go back and
transport everything again okay um jave we've been talking about the uh show um getting the tags
from the fact file and transferring them to the all gameplay three and speaks that would be really
handy if we could include that into my hpour transcode script sure yeah i i can i think i can get you
something together in the next one we go to that sort of timescale that's uh that's not critical
i think you you are working on something even more important for us okay well we'll talk about
scheduling offline perhaps but uh yeah whatever no say the word actually i was more thinking about
fixing the broker links and the uh oh that's this that i just sent you this morning oh yes yes yes
yes i had a little play with that by the way and i've got got some ideas that we perhaps need to
discuss that uh yeah looks looks doable cool um as part of that the i want to change the um i need to
add support within the database for a you know twitter identica feed and then um that needs to be
added to the cms thing that i used to post the shows plus it also needed needs to be added to the
index pages and the rss feeds to make sure that that's added at the top and then the feeds for the
the feeds identica and twitter need to be updated to uh just use that feed um and whilst i need
somebody to uh who has familiarity with working with amazon cloud to contact me because there is a
amazon cloud like tool for uploading to our card org and i would very much like help with that
and how to get that working um and that's pretty much what's going on on the list there is one
thing that i'm thinking about now because don't so much work on the uh that has been needed to secure
the main website i'm just thinking would it be simpler to go uh a clean html five css3 solution
to the website and you know just pick a a generic theme rather than also having the exposure
of having your wordpress blog on top i'm open to opinions well if we can discuss this on the
mailing list i guess okay moving on events upcoming events linux fest north west 2013 belagam
washington's w a anyone anyone all the americans are going what the hell these foreigners they
know nothing about geography april the 27th 28th contact divot with them for all more information
and that pretty much brings me to the end of the show except to say that there are 22 shows in
the queue from seven hosts 175 slots are needed to follow this year so if you can contribute please
do so by going to hackerpublicradio.org and follow the links to the contribute page
and with that with that i'll say it's goodbye from me goodbye for me oh sorry about that goodbye
