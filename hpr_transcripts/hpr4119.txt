This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4, 119 for Thursday the 16th of May 2024.
Today's show is entitled Cubs James 3.
It is part of the series All Songs Considered.
It is hosted by Cuff and is about 12 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is a compilation of liberal licensed music that Cuff enjoyed listening to.
Welcome to the third episode of Cuff's James.
We'll start with a couple electronic pieces from Arkady Kaplan, corporate success and
chasing the shadow.
I also featured Kaplan in the second episode of Cuff's James way back in 2016.
I'm glad to be back.
Next up are two dubstep selections, Time to Army by Museo Jad and Sweet Nothing by Camera.
Daniel Batista's Symphony No. 5 will close out the episode.
Daniel Batista wins at free Libre and open source.
Not only is he playing public domain Beethoven, but he recorded and mixed the album on a Gentoo
Linux box.
Gentoo is how I really learned Linux.
He's still releasing Libre licensed albums and his newer releases have video recordings
which he edits in Kate and live.

to Army by Museo Jad and Sweet Nothing by Camera.

Thank you for listening to this third episode of Cuff's James.
I hope we can enjoy some new tunes together soon.
