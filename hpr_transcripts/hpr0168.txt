So welcome to this week for an executive group. How are you doing?
Fine, fine, fine. Finally, rocks here.
Oh, that's great. That's great.
So, if you do anything interesting, lastly.
How is your computer?
I thought of something really interesting about the TV or what you're useful.
You can take things that you've recorded.
And one of the menu options is burn.
Who do you need?
I need the oven.
Yes, all I can do is open the oven.
The other person may need the oven for a few more work.
They deal very perfect.
They enhance the food, the load, the morals, the last part too.
No, no, no.
But it actually puts on hold on.
You can have us if you want to talk about everything.
And I'm actually hoping so that it gets on the TV.
So, I've said that it's going to be a follow.
It's going to be four hours on your DVD.
And you just want to do everything.
Ask for a blank CD.
It's like a DVD.
And it just works.
So, in my spare time, I can get on your DVD and walk it.
Sure.
Yes.
The berms are right on the box on the mystery DVD box.
Yeah, look at the berms on it.
It's just one point on DVD plus R.
It works so well.
And I tried out a DVD player.
It worked perfectly.
It's something sweet.
It was pretty impressive that actually.
I think that I knew that it's a flood.
It's a flood.
It's a flood.
Yeah.
It's that up.
Yeah.
I thought it'd be really useful if you were starting, like, over the whole, like, half-hour shows.
And you wanted to make a DVD out of it.
And because it works, the whole menu system is right there too.
So, you can find the gem book and watch.
And it comes.
Everything.
So, I was very happy to get a book here.
Which one?
Well, still I.
Long story.

What's the other one?
I have to do it.
What's the problem?
It means that I have to do...
It looks like it's supposed to stop.
That's right.
It looks so funny when you start making sound.
Or you're not going to startны.
Don't you?
We've got one group of dogs out in front of the table.
Which one people are watching they'll be able to see them.
Do you have one again?
Yes.
I've got access to colorplotters that you need to banner on paper.
Yes.
Okay.
There's a man.
Got a couple of he's.
There's lots of them like that.
We're talking about South Africa.
Oh.
Yeah, organizing him when they go on paper.
Could I get a colored colored red?
Yeah.
I'd like to tell you about that.
It's too much fun.
It's too much.
It was too much.
Come on.
Oh Sam, I didn't know it.
Yeah.
We our little time重 in in the Federal signed fire.
And then they remember we had two weeks actually for advertising and at the library.
So we shouldn't have had other people to take to them.
So maybe that maybe too far.
But we've got a CD, and we don't know how long that is.
And then we have to do it.
What is South For Freedom Day?
For free?
And what is the goodest addition between the providers out there?
So I think that there was more material that was directly used here.
And that's what I just saw.
A lot of stuff from what we wanted to do at the library.
Let me see.
I'll try to get on the wall.

How's that?
Is that an victim?
That's fine.
Okay.
Come used to get on the wall.
Well, I know what's the lead type.
But the leads are the left two minutes forward and reminds.
more accelerator and then use the clutch most people don't put enough on the
accelerator and then feather the clutch out. Oh no so you don't want to do that
you don't want to let the clutch out that fast yeah no it's tough it's
tricky I think it makes driving more fun oh I can't
I don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do that you don't want to do

Yeah, I think that's about what comes back to them to get the table to action.
Can you give us the back house?
And I think that I want them to get what they want.
But you can put the table right down there where you would use the table.
Right.
And I would put the table to the table.
Yeah.
So you can buy more.
Do you guys get to go out there?
Yeah.
How about you?
Next to you.
Okay.
Yeah.
That was actually there.
Why do you want them to resign?
But they would be able to offer a year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
But I can see.
It's just the tickets.
It's not sure right that one's tickets.
Yeah.
That's why it's not sure right that one's tickets.
Yeah.
He was in jail.
The hard part of it.
It doesn't happen.
Yeah.
It's been here.
Did you look at a shipping calculator at all?
It's pretty easy to do this with a paypal.
You know, paypal buy-out.
You don't want to pay for the credit cards.
But then, if you're not the shipping,
it's a good way to do that.
A paypal shipping calculator is really cool.
How was you saying this is a good deal?
Yeah.
Just big shipping and this thing.
Yeah.
That's what I ended up doing.
But we got some of these plots in Stockham, Canada.
And I had just pretty much used the difference in shipping.
A lot of times, they say, well, Canada is in Canada.
So, yeah.
We actually shipping in Canada.

yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ok yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
and I'll find it.
I'm a DDS and OTH.
M.O.G.H.
and M.O.G.H.
and I'll find it.
I'll find it.
You guys have to pick it up.
I'm a lot of people.
I'm a lot of people.
I wish that it's not like the going on.
Or at least the going on.
Right.
Exactly.
So, didn't there be a web browser?
I mean, that's a...
That was on there.
Oh, okay.
Oh, you got blender?
All right.
We'll open it.
We have open office.
So, there's office.
Email client, right?
Oh, it's not there.
Then, let me try and do a blog.
People want artists to plan.
Firefox, forefathers.
Use the blog cap picture.
It's a little good job.
I'm excited about it.
It's just like, just fire.
And...
Mirror.
You know?
Mirror.
But it's a small, beautiful video concept.
It would be a...
There was one of my electronics things.
It was a little blurb on that blender.
Well, that's what we get created.
I get pretty grown families.
I think it should.
If I was a start-up movie?
Right.
Yeah, take a lot of time.
That's take a lot of time.
Yes, we're here.
Eight people for the...
He was what we were saying.
Brad, what was the name of Brad?
Big part of it.
Big part of it.
Two, then, eight months.
Eight people.
Two, then, eight months to do that.
It's like a computer.
There's a lot there.
That's what I was saying.
They had actually done any pranker farm.
About something like GTK Pod.
So people will really appreciate the advantages of free software.
So they won't have their iPod controls.
Taking them to the online store all the time.
I don't know if GTK Pod is...
Oh, but...
Right.
GTK Pod is...
Oh, probably not.
There is...
There's an Amarachu Windows, though, isn't it?
It's not.
I think they want that for it.
But it is not.
They do.
There is an Amarachu Windows yet.
But I could go up to install...
...some other packages.
So then we have...
Like a scheduling.
And I applied...
Here's that in the bird.
And there was an XJAP in the YRC line.
And then I quote, create it.
So, the Jocity.
Blender.
Do you have a better one?
I don't know how it's going to sound.
So I'll be careful when you have XJAP in the background.
So it's good and better.
Well, Pigeon, I don't think it's IRC.
It's IRC.
Yeah, you can.
There is a lot of people use Pigeon to IRC.
Okay, I guess that helps.
Let's say.
Thank you.
But those connect you at the ELL?
Yes.
Yeah.
Your Pigeon tries to pull the load on the bird.
So no, XJAP.
I find it nice to load that one.
Yes.
It's a songbird.
I want to make a song for you.
What's a songbird?
It's a songbird.
So we have a songbird.
What is it?
Yes.
A songbird.
That's a player.
Music player.
Thanks, JAP.
So we have an LCD Blender.
Again, paint.net.
Some people requested that.
In-state.
Zara Zara.
So if we have a paint.net, we'll take this one.
Is Zara free?
It is now.
Oh, it is.
So we'll keep you there.
It's really a true service.
You all right?
No, it's not.
It is.
That's N-I-2.
Is it?
Yeah.
Take a photo of that.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
Which one is it?
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
I'll take a photo of it.
Thanks, JAP.
This is the service.
That's the car.
Then there was a Rolls-Darrick.
Is that the latest version?
Yes.
Definitely a difficult one.
Saltics.
It's new I-Zell Wigglesaw for media production software.
He can do story books.
You can see quite important books.
Wired notes.
Stuff like that.

So that's a game? Yes, sure, put it there. I know if I share those games, I'll never put that on CD.
Well, Sudoku, I mean, is another basic, you know, Windows kind of game.
So, like, almost all those games are scale-as-you know.
I don't know what, what's not, or enough, but recall if you said it was a small and stuff like that.
Is it small? I thought that I need a pre-game.
I can do it. What does it do? I don't like here.
It's like, civilization, or something. Civilization? Of course.
Simulator. Simulator. Simulator. Simulator. Simulator.
Someone like Simulator, or do you think you create your society?
And he thinks it's a size matter.
Let's move on. Good ball.
Okay. So, you have Q&A, Q&A, Q&A, ELC, Songbird, thanks.
The utility, the backup, R, I cannot say that.
Get Adam Strangett, and he really likes it. He's saying it's very similar, like, as a single backup,

I think it's open source license but I would have been finding license there.
Here's your register.
If your register blows up, you can open this program and you can say,
all what color is white and I'm a resistor.
Resistors generally don't blow up.
They just say no, really they know.
They had a meltdown.
They can know.
There was one that they thought aren't with.
K3D, yeah.
I don't think there's a Windows version.
You can see it burning if you know that.
VLC.
VLC.
VLC.
I think that was very few.
It's pretty anyway.

Stripes that I do have this program. You just take the first and color transfer
numbers and you take the third color, multiply by that is zero.
I can grow a lot in the program, but the next one is always gold.
Unless you got any expensive one.
Silver over.
That's your color.
I don't understand how gold is worse than silver.
I don't understand how gold is worse than silver.
Gold is harder to see in the round case.
That's good.
If somebody wants to want a Spanish, you'll have that and I cannot pronounce it like gold.
Does that one talk through your speakers or what?
No idea.
Just let me out.
All I know about Spanish is that's the idea and it's a taco.
How about Luna?
How about Luna?
It's a weird one.
Surveillance.
Surveillance.
You should learn Surveillance.
You should learn Surveillance.
One more out of all.
Beer.
Surveillance is beer.
And you never ask for one more beer.
You just say one more.
Luna.
We have that category.
It's when we did all that programming.
So there's the composer.
You know?
That's the album.
Gbit.
I think that's when S&P.
I guess if somebody is going to be, you know,
chatting with other people and programming.
What is secure copies?
What is secure copies?
What is when S&P?
What is secure copies?
What is secure copies?
What is secure copies?
Berserk bit.
What is secure copies?
Berserk bit.
What is secure copies?
Berserk bit.
Berserk bit.
They are like,
That is secure copy.
Yeah.
The user can buy everything by not providing it with a string.
Do you have a Linux server and the only way to get to it is to use this guy?
No, I just need to get to your file.
It's just like holding it into Nautilus.
Yeah, I get it, but I just don't think Secure Copies tells you what it does.
You should say Secure File Manager or something like that.
Do you guys adjust?
Thank you.
What kind of reaction is that?
Yeah, I mean, if you're going to try to get these people to see what this does,
I mean, I just think File Manager to a window's person says a lot more about what it does.
What do you guys have in the description for the progress you draw to outside and find out about this?
Sure, sure.
Probably want to end all of the descriptions.
Possibly?
Yeah, I already used it.
Midnight Commander to go across the network, you know, for a while.
You know, because you can run the network.
You can?
Yeah, I can.
That's according to their help again, but that's as hard as I could get with it.
It's possible.
Yeah.
So, here, that's a different level of CXC for a file file.
It's only runs on.
I see.
That's supposed to say, a lot here.
One more of those.
It has to be done there.
All those surveys support for RANTA.
Nobody said for before in the Spanish forest,
that I can come around and ask you to go around.
Before we get back, let me go around.
Dr. Dane, I'm going to go around this.
It's water-rich.
It says, NG companies.
I use the NG companies.
Now we can do RANTA.
It's very good.
Yes.
And to the games, as well, we have 25.
The Redwood, Bluewood.
Next to the sign up.
The white here.
That's right, sir.
That's more water-rich.
That's me.
Water-rich.
Eyes out for your Heutello.
You can change your email.
He needs a video card to do that.
But it won't be able to download.
You could use this brand-new convention
and it says세요ponio, I think, call your phone.
I don't have your phone number, do you want to share with us a cell phone?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

He's trying to annoy us enough that we'll chip in and buy him a new video card or something. Oh, how do you like that? Do you? Yeah, it's really a nice one factor. Oh, same as yours. Well, if this had been available at the time, I like these better, because you got function keys for one thing. Well, you really miss them if you don't have them. Well, you really miss them if you don't have them. Well, you really miss them if you don't have them. Well, you really miss them if you don't have them.
Very nice. How's the battery life? Oh, yeah. Very nice. And wireless, I imagine. I thought there'd be a lot more of it, that size.
computers out by now you know like prepare to school kind of things but there's
still five six hundred dollar laptops.
We need to have girls listening.
See?
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
But nobody's actually checking IRC channel.
And I can't be reading it and checking it and checking.
It's kind of hurt to act like a hot student taught his parents.
Yeah, there we go.
What's up?
Go there.
Yeah.
Go there.
What's the open source being?
Oh, that would be cool.
Just click.
Click on it.
It would go out worse.
Sure, it will.
I don't know.
All you gotta do is click on it.
Just make it easy.
You know, these are people I've just always said.
Oh, it's huge.
Oh, it's huge.
Wow.
Wow.
And with your key, that's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a good, uh, simple box.
You have an everywhere all day.
Yeah.
And that stimulus is actually really good.
Oh, yeah.
Tremulance.
I actually thought tremulance was perfect.
How is it?
Yes.
We actually get into it.
It's, you know, TV strap.
Oh, it's cool.
It's more better than the running around right in the shooting at people.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Two, one.
Two, one.
I don't clicked.
I got, I got boarded with Quake.
But PowerStrip.
So why don't you see it, basically?
Yeah.
Boy, yeah.
PowerStrip.
Which one?
I don't know.
Ok, for you guys.
Now I have a seat.
Thanks.
Where do we go?
Easy, huh?
I don't know.
Somebody locked in there.
I don't know. Somebody logged in there, so he still had to do that, and all of them has been that sending out a problem with D and D and D and D.
I'll tell you who he is. I'll tell you who he is.
No, it doesn't wait to hear.
Who's your info? Who is?
The purple is from, the purple is from, that means it's a pigeon.
And then here's actually your address. Right, but on Berk E.C. it's the correct name.
It's the correct name here.
I think you can sit down.
Anything you have to say about the address that I have, means that we are from the same world.
I think that's what it's written about.
It's the right name, the right name, the right name.
When you first add the address, you should get your name.
But I think you could change the name.
That's my name.
But it says the right one here.
Yep.
You can't have two people say name, right?
No, you can't have that.
You know, close the chat.
I don't know.
You could not get a surgery, could you?
I don't know.
No, I don't know.
That's what it's written about.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now, right now.
We can all delete, and then all the time again.
Total tax rates.
Tax rates.
We start.
We test.
What is we test?
Testing again.
It's like plus.
But, this too.
We start in the test SS1.
Test 0, test 0.
Test and test 0.
But it's already done.
It is the first second test.
It's the second test.
It's the first test.
It's the first test.
It's the first test, it's the test.
And that works.
Here we have the second.
Oh yeah.
It's you.
Yep.
Yes.
It's the smash name.
You can do it.
You can do it with a smash name.
Well, that would be her main voice set.
Okay, that works.
That's 2.0.
There it works.
There you go, piece of sex.
Play the sex.
So, we're not our other things.
Supertalks. Supertalks.
Supertalks.
So, I play the street piece too.
I do the forklift.
But I don't want to talk to cars.
So, I think it's good too.
Both of them.
Yeah
And everybody check what is a stand-up
Stand-up
Yeah
But the only way to do it is to make it possible for us to engage in things that are on it.
I don't know where it is going to be.
So that might be it.
I think Treble's front is on the way.
I don't know these two now.
Yeah, yeah.
He's also like what he's talking about.
How do you found it and dedicate it to the next situation?
It was in the SCA.
It was just the games and it's good luck.
I don't know if I'm popular, but it started out in the mid-90s.
Yeah.
It had a little popularizer.
It was a game, the one who was like that,
but then it was good, it's good for you to make it happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, we received it.
Sure.
But we got out of SCA some fun here.
So, okay, thank you.
Okay, so, how do we do?
There's a thing, yes, right?
Two hours.
You always spend, like, maybe it's start for hours or 20 hours.
Cool. So, shall we go on the newsletter?
Sure.
The email I sent last week, which is a food future with a whole link to that.
It's a link with it.
I don't actually what happened.
People said it was a text, and it's very strange.
I don't know if that's what happened, but I don't know.
You know what a Thunderbird asked you, if you want to send it,
a simple HTML, or a simple text, or HTML, who doesn't want?
Why do they have that?
Some people don't want to receive HTML email.
Yeah.
Some people think it shouldn't even be used on the web,
because they don't have a band with.
Well, and it's a good way to put redirects and things like that in there.
You can take it in there.
There's more you can show it.
Okay.
I don't know this type of text.
You would just send it in that text folder.
What's the name of it?
It's probably a lot of us.
Very strange.
Yeah, it's a little platform.
30.
You can still have a link in the email.
Or is that the value of HTML?
No, the plain text email, it wouldn't be a hot link anyway.
You can click a URL there.
He said you have to click here, but you say,
click and order for the link while you're able to say click.
Yeah, you don't have to click a link.
Right.
The mail reader detects the link for you to take yourself.
This is the link, because it starts with HTML and inserts it.
And then it says, OK, if your client doesn't do it,
then the plain text doesn't have it.
All right.
Last week, there was a link.
The next world, I think.
It's interesting.
And I came with all of this,
but there was big announcements.
I think it was saying that they party with that,
with a few people,
another man,
to deliver a lot of this and that,
and walking.
So when Microsoft reads this out worldwide,
and it's a very ambitious project,
they're saying that this is starting at anniversary,
and I think it's starting at the same time.
So they're saying that this is something that I think
that they don't dare to think about.
They have that thinking about Microsoft reads this out,
they even do that.
Of course, it doesn't always tell me whether that's the point
to have theseぇ wrapped up.
And there was a lot of articles that I'm going at.
As long as we read back to our radio,
and very much,
there will always be a thing we're ready to,
and all of a sudden,
I think it's a good thing because you'll be in the list out just when you go to college.
And we all need like to go to college.
You know, because I was, you know, wacky star.
But then you don't care how to go to college.
I don't mind.
And I think it was a very, very nice conversation.
In the out of the world, I hear it's supposed to be.
The world member is $1,000,000 a year.
You know, I'm pretty pleased.
Also, I do feel it's the primary part of the future.
Last week we were talking about it.
I was going to do something because it was a loss.
It was a loss of snow.
It was a messaging protocol.
It was a messaging application.
But you, I don't think you sure about it.
I thought it was a protocol, but it was a messaging protocol.
Program.
I see how many people we've got.
I think I have to cut it out.
This one, this one.
Last week we had a little demonstration called the
whatever it was.
I'm going to talk about this stuff.
How we are going to just stop it.
It's also going to be what I gave you.
You'll be able to move it.
It's very hard to do a little bit of conceptualize.
I guess.
I've never seen any of those that really look like they were.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
We can't make a circle of some applications.
They all have to be able to forward.
That's what I was going to do.
Something like this, I think Microsoft's a group of things.
Yeah, you can do that.
Microsoft.
That is pretty exact.
Intel is going to have their own discrete graphics card.
It's going to be long enough for you to buy.
If you have a static and end video, you might want to sell it seriously.
They won't be in business two years.
They can't afford to.
Nobody can afford to compete head to head with Intel really.
There will be a net chart.
I think it's going to be a lot of money.
I think it's going to be a lot of money.

YouMusic
Yeah.
I can't take what it is.
Hey.
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
He's out into something.
Absolutely.
He's a worker.
Yeah, that's what happens.
Yeah.
He's holding trucks.
You built that?
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
That's the first project.
That's the year project.
That's the year to build it.
Right now, we've got the neighbors box.
That's all.
So, now I want this one.
So, perfect.
I think this is a manager.
It's a very simple manager.
I think that it can be raw finance.
It's like you have raw finance, right?
Yeah.
You can actually see that.
Well, we don't that plus plus.
It's because of the obligation.
So, it's not the same thing.
That's the same thing.
That's the same thing.
Yes.
I don't think it's time for part of this one.
It was a very cool feature.
It's website.
It's interesting.
It's website.
Yeah.
The arm-free music.
Audio files.
So, anything that is in public domain.
People read.
And then you can.
For minimal amount, you can actually purchase.
And up to five years for publishing.
So, I'm saying.
Creative college.
50 or so years.
And you.
And see.
Well, it's like for online books.
It is.
Creative.
Well, Spencer.
Spencer.
James Spencer.
I'm missing cocktails.
Right now, I was at Ulfruim.
And he has a very good podcast.
But he didn't hit me.
So, they hit Christmas SharePoint.
And then I will tell you.
And it's going to be posted on December 2005.
And what it becomes to be.
I think if I click on it, it will tell me.
When it becomes to be created comments.
There is.
Yeah, 2010.
And if you want to listen to it.
It's like five dollars.
Six dollars.
And it is.
Because there are a lot of stuff on here that's free now.
Because it's over the date.
I think so.
Well, sorry.
The last one.
Yes.
All right.
100,000 people.
And this guy is actually a jackpot.
So, this one was like two dollars and four.
Every five dollars.
And he is working for NPR.
And he has the audio voice.
So, and he's a pretty good job.
It's no more.
So, you just paint in the sky.
You can't read Charles.
You can do that one.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's a GR3.
So, yes.
Yes.
And it's a Christmas SharePoint.
So, Charles, if you want somebody to leave you.
Just press it back on.
So, I can press it back on.
Just keep going that way for you.
Yes.
Oh, you can't wait for more here.
So, again, there is a free content there too.
The free stuff there.
There is this stuff that is just hosted.
As a right now.
And it's free.
But, I don't know how long it's been.
So, it's like this one's free.
You should just download all free stuff.
Instead, you can get your own library.
And then click for five dollars.
You can check it in the undercut.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Three hundred and fifty.
So, it was interesting to say.
And I got to withdraw from James Kessler.
Record your this stuff.
It was interesting to record.
Record your this stuff.
It wasn't included in there.
So, you have this example.
And I never heard about it.
I never heard about this example.
So, what else is there?
I don't know.
Well, this is already thought that book out commercial applications are going to be available.
They have commercial applications.
They are free software applications.
But they post like the support that you will pay for.
So, there's our press code.
Our press code is half advantageous to send.
There is one to simply.
You can get this free simple app.
It's your collaboration suite.
Here is some 19 years since back on solution.
This is actually what they are going to have in their project.
They will ship five already parent systems.
So, they are shipping five.
They have these two studio 13.
And XPS and 1530.
And these are the regular ones.
This one is 15 inch.
And this one is 13, 12.9, whatever it is.
And this is in this one.
You see that people are probably buying more laptops than this one.
It's like they have a future solution.
Do they still have to do where it actually costs more to buy a Linux computer than it did buy a pretty whole state for the Windows one for a while?
I don't know.
For a while it was like 50 bucks more.
Some people are watching mostly but I have not heard any.
I know that these ultra portable.
They did let's say a window is going to cost you less but it has a lesser heart rate there.
What is this model made of?
It has the same price.
It has the same price.
Oh, okay.
So, yeah, that's all right.
And we have two more power come to it.
Easy to develop it because we have an obligation from software again.
This is like everybody is going to do it.
Yes.
And this is true.
I do want to work with our applications.
Even though we are just running,
it looks like you probably should stick it to a software that needs to be built.
It's so easy to run.
Is it really easy?
I've never tried it but it's probably a good idea.
See?
Done.
Okay.
Really?
So, it's actually a fleet which are already built.
I want to website.
I do.
I do that.
I love that I want to.
Tips and tricks, as well as dependencies,
I want to run a brand.
I do not run a brand,
but it's really something.
So, somebody heard about Parking and Powell.
So, there's up to date,
and I'm trying to just find what's out there
and what's on there.
And, exactly, how about the day?
How about the day?
Or, do you have any experience?
I think it's up to date.
Actually, your assessment is up to date.
You are using it to get on your own.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm using the presentation.
Yeah.
I'm assuming.
You know, it gives us a strength as well.
Well, I'll be using hand-priced products.
And that's what it looks like in the section.
A driveled model, probably with the Arty,
where somebody's talking about tomorrow.
There you go.
Use SSH,
local, and remote,
for voting.
So, how do you vote for where we are at the site?
Now, for a time protocol,
the same one.
What bizarre thing was that you set up yourself
one server with an NTP,
and then you call your class.
So, we set it back in my PC.
It's 610 servers.
And,
right,
you need to call characters with a
composed,
this actually,
that, that,
that,
that,
so,
you can't start it,
it's going to be,
it'll not be composed,
and then,
you can't do your special characters.
You know,
but,
it's interesting.
And,
that's probably,
is there no?
It's like,
this is in Haiti,
you see no,
it's both of them.
So, you see,
there you have it.
So, you hold,
you have to be careful,
and then,
you need to suck,
it, it,
but, you need to make it,
first.
Well,
what, what is it,
default?
Uh,
it's definitely good,
it's a cat block,
or a somewhere,
or a somewhere,
or a somewhere.
Oh,
I don't know.
So, we go to,
I didn't want to go in the
weather park for a prince's
and,
or,
or,
and then, um, lay out options. I think I, yeah, lay out options, lay out options, lay out.
You just have to know that list, but again, right? Uh, yes. So if you're using something else, I'd be able to get rid of the grease on it.
Uh, a dollar sign. I don't know. I think the dollar sign is not a special layer. It makes a degree. So, you know, not get right.
It's not right. It was your way more degree. I think the dollar sign is not a special layer.
I think that's a different layer. I think that's a different layer.
You probably put some closer together. Yeah. I mean, I'll look at what you put.
The kerning is probably different. It screws up and it's like, yeah, the undo worked out.
Kerning is different, I guess. Yeah. Same thing with two dashes. It's mostly working, like, more than combined.
Yeah. Same along the way. Yeah.
So that would be about it for me. We're heading at the better for today.
The last one. That was the last one. So I'm trying to get more knowledge.
Oh, no. There was all the factual things left up there.
That's cool. So shall we enter the recording?
So, thanks for listening and see you next week.
Thank you for listening to Half the Public Radio.
HPR is sponsored by Carol.net. So head on over to C-A-R-O-DOT.
Or O-DOT, it seems, all of us will leave.
Thank you.
