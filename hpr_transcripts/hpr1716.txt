Hi everybody, my name is Ken Balan and you're listening to HPR Community News for February 2015.
Join me this evening, yes? Hi, it's Dave Morris.
Hi Dave, nice to just with you again after Foster.
Yes, I should say excuse any noise in the background. I've got the mother and father of all,
probably the grandfather of all storms going on here and it makes the rain clatter on the roof
of the extension I'm sitting in here. So there you go.
Now that's at least you know what it is. Do you want to introduce the two new hosts?
Oh, first of all, just for people who are new to HPR, HPR is a community network where the
shows are provided by you, the listener, i.e. you, the person listening with the earbuds in their ears.
And this month we have two new hosts and they are.
They are Kevin who we've heard of before but this is the first time he's done a show himself
and Swift 110, Swift 110, I'm not sure how he says his handle, but that's two years.
Excellent, he didn't actually introduce himself on the show.
No, he didn't, probably a good tip for everybody is could you introduce yourself on the show
over here actually excellent. Okay, the purpose of this show is that once a month we just give you a
rundown if you're just listening to the podcast feed we give you a rundown of what's going on on
the HPR mail list which you should join especially if you're a host and that is where the decisions
about HPR are taken such as they are and also comments that have been left on the various
different episodes and we also go through the episodes one by one for the last month just to have
a quick chat about them. And the first episode of last month, hardly enough, was HPR 1696
and that was HPR community news, a live event that we did as Boston.
Yeah, that was fun to do. The audio is a bit of a challenge though I think, wasn't it?
It was a stupendous challenge in actual fact and yeah, completely had no preparation done for
recording a live show like that because you know if you've never recorded a live show like that
thought that there might be some sort of PA in the room that we could plug into was as it turned out
everybody had a good recorder because they had good recorders that were only picking up
the person who was talking so it was a nightmare. But I found a way back on Foss weekly there was a
German show on about an audio site where you could upload your audio and it was I think was
developed by a group of students who wanted to tidy up their notes from lectures and it absolutely
polished the video. So yeah, it did a pretty good job actually, yeah. Anybody who was slightly
off mic was because of the nature of the the recorders we were using as you said was was very
very quiet and you could hear the thing suddenly grabbing that sound and boosting it up when it
came to them. It probably probably worked better if you'd actually been there and heard people but
yeah, it did do an amazing job astonishing. I had a before, yeah, I had done a lot of it on the
train as I was going up from Foss town because I only had it was on the Sunday night and the show
needed to be posted and if you are so it was it was a bit scary I must say. So I had something that
would have worked was this this worked quite well. I'm trying to find the the name of the service
actually that I used but I can't I'll see if I can put it in the show notes for this episode.
Anyway, the following day we had the first of the Fostem episodes and we
interviewed Bradley and Karen from the software Freedom Conservancy and basically all the Fostem
episodes. Let's just kind of I don't know let's I suppose chat about them now and then as one big
thing that's lost. Yeah, it was nice to hear Bradley and Karen being being interviewed.
I was quite happy. I didn't meet Bradley but I did meet Karen who is it seems a really nice person
pleased to meet her. It was a it was nice it was nice event actually they're I think they're
planning on doing that again next year. So this was at the Conservancy event. So it's actually
great idea because you go and you know there's a restaurant and you can get one food after traveling
and meet up with people and we met up with yeah I met up with lords of people and yeah pretty good
hotel was all yeah yeah the hotel was great wasn't it yeah yeah yeah I was sad I didn't make that
that meeting my plane was quite seriously delayed you just snowing London apparently
don't know quite what that had to do with me but there you go. I was blaming it on Ryanair
almost Belgium. Well that was well yeah the fact that I came I landed in an airport about an hour
away didn't help a lot. Yeah you're not the first to do that. Okay so we had during the interviews
so literally we had a interview with Norm with Fedora with OpenStack yeah Santos S.
Yeah those were some interesting discussions there actually it was you you seem to
caught some of the well it's the nature of Fosdem I guess isn't it that some of the key
movers and shakers in these these projects are there in front of you so it sounds a few you got
quite a few of them there. Yeah very much so and the people on the booth are more than happy to
no no you need to talk to him you need to talk to him. This project leaves it's your job this is
why you got elected and they're more than happy just to you know the the but the head developer
whoever's supposed to be leading the project in the interview chat so except of course for Debian
who just have regular people and pop up they don't want cloud disbara disbola was an interesting talk
as well. I got a lot out of this I mean I love these because I don't need to do anything it's just
hi I'm from HBO and they kind of know who we are now so they just are more than ready to chat
to us which is fantastic. Yeah it's a great way of getting to know some of the the project as
well I think isn't it's I mean there were things there that I hadn't really heard about before so
it's you know good good way to raise awareness if you know I have to speed with some of these things.
Yeah exactly and we had requested the booth and in a way I'm glad we didn't get it because it is
a lot of work you know there's a set up before and saying again if you don't if you don't know how
busy your normal conference is the the conference boots as a plus stem are just phenomenally busy
and it seems as well that they got even busier and busier as the thing was beginning to wind time
yeah it was it was mobbed all the time that I saw it it it is a massive thing and yeah it's
hard work being on those those desks I think on those tables. Absolutely. From one of the the
interviews I enjoyed the most myself was the Wikimedia one um largely because I had an interview
them last year and also the guys from the chaos computer club or you know hackton it had a nice
good a nice thing and it was nice to catch up with the all the other guys as well.
Collab and then Dudu Linux I Mike had some questions in about them and I missed
missed the opportunity to do that but by the time I got up there I was so tired and hungry
I was beginning to begin to lose that you know what I mean. Well yeah all props to you for
for them the number of the interviews you managed to get there. I was knackered just wondering around
going a few few talks and stuff so you were on the go all the time so great stuff. I actually
on the Sunday morning we got into some talks and stuff on new radio which is fantastic I really
enjoyed it. So the following let's just jump forward to episode 1700 today with a techie episode
2000 and for those of you who don't know hackup of the radio is a rebranding of today with a techie
which was a kind of pun on the twit network when that started off and so as of episode 2000 came
out nine years three months and 27 days after the project started so in order to do that I put
together a show of see everybody introducing themselves and yeah it was a lot of work.
It was great though it was lovely I just loved that. I think I think you got quite a few responses
to that as well it's just it was just I think people were sitting there listening I know I was
listening. When's it going to be with you? When's it going to be me? Oh yeah yeah I'm there I'm on
the map it was it was lovely it was a brilliant thing to do I do appreciate how much work it
must have taken though. It was a bit of work and the three honest I was listening for myself because
I didn't know when I was coming off because I had taken the audio extracts and put them in as like
because the ID numbers were from both today with a techie and from HPR and the restart at the
IDs so I wasn't 100% sure what the IDs were going to match up so so I was just listening to
when I my own name come up. I actually missed that today with a techie thing being two and it's really
cool. Yes I did actually listen to some of those back in the day that was around about the
time I first started to listen to podcasts and yeah it was quite nostalgic to hear that for me as well.
Yeah and I just got the word from groups that he's found the database and some archive episodes
so we'll be getting those as well which is fantastic news I know you're cool. So cool that was
that episode 1700 and if anyone has any ideas for HPR 2000 then I give this a shout. Then we had
Fostem Part 4 or 5 at Goro Voting which was an interesting one you know an open source
voting system that's auditable I think that's a brilliant idea. The DIY book scanner I loved the
open embedded the Dutch the Dutch and Belgium the German and Belgium amateur radio union were there
XBMC and I know Kai who my nephew was there was thrills of the XBMC were there
Oh cool yeah yeah I thought the explanation of Cody was okay it came across really really well
obviously we've done that many times we had a great job. Absolutely yeah and then we had
react to S and this was a a Lesky was a fantastic fantastic guide to interview as well just come
come across as a really believing in this project. Fantastic we're coral. Yes sorry
his enthusiasm was was amazing isn't it yeah I listened to him a couple of times because he
sounded so so enthusiastic. Absolutely yeah and Koro S and Wolf SSL Pico TCP
ultimaker yeah the ultimaker was pretty cool actually while the other three are focused on
embedded stuff so they kind of and the cloud and stuff so that's very polished the ultimaker guys
seem like guys who are very much there you know community not like any other guys away from the
community around I'd love to have an ultimaker I really would. Yes you'd need a fair amount of cash
to afford on them unfortunately. Yeah but I mean the reasonably priced you know what I think
yeah true there are quite open source free software viewing you know after the interview you can
take the thing you can take all their designs and make your own you know so that's that's pretty cool.
I had a really had a laugh with Carl Daniel and the Corbucci of Lashrump we just
absolutely it was really nice because we had a conversation before and after so it was very very
nice. Yeah I rushed off to check to see whether my mother board would take it after listening to
that I did know about it but I never really looked into it very much unfortunately it can't but
next one definitely. Yeah there again I was just explaining to a guy in work him you know you're
you want to run Linux on a piece of hardware by definition it's all your first attempt is
always going to be the hardest because you've not met any effort to buy you've not known about
Linux in order to buy harder that will be suitable to run Linux excellently you know the further
on you go the easier it gets because right my next laptop is going to have all Intel hardware and
I'm going to check my printers before I buy them and you're not just going down and going oh I'll buy
the coolest laptop out there you know. Yeah I know I know I actually put the the machine I'm working on
here is when I built myself but I didn't know enough at the time to to spec a mother board that
would that would do this. I'm not sure what the state of the call but it was at that time but
I know the UEFI stuff was was was the big deal at the time but yeah yeah anyway but hindsight's
great isn't it. Yeah but then again you like with me with this laptop you end up getting you know
you make a choice like I want to buy a laptop with a running Linux OS or no OS and that's
whittled down the field of available laptops to two so it's a pretty easy choice then.
True enough true enough. Then I the last of the interviews was with the SAS N OGS and as soon as
I can I've gone to participate in that project it's just yeah I did a one of my first jobs on
account in the Netherlands was working on satellite operations and this is a love of mine so
pretty cool stuff. Enjoyed all that. Enjoyed pasta and was great to meet you as well.
Yeah it's it's it's good to good to get there and to to meet meet several HPR people as well
that was fun that was great. And the name escapes me well. To be frank. To be frank. And
nightways nightways was there. And need all course. Needle media. Needle was there. Yep.
Yep. His father. I'm missing somebody I'm sure but yeah from Finland who we met on
not from Finland. Who is under identical. Yeah I know I know I've
brainfade brainfade. Hello I'm John Kade silence a bit so. Do you have a identical from
by chance. Yes I do. It's the person you think of is Matt. That's who goes by the by the
handles sazius I think on on identical. Yeah we went up to dinner with Matt and actually
JWP did. No we missed Matt's that night because he was staying with the same hotel. That's right
that's right yeah yeah we met up with him afterwards and he was we had a drink with him and
I think it was happening is rather late dinner. That's correct yeah. That's a good laugh. Good laugh.
Okay that was basically first time it was and it's a fantastic fantastic weird thing with these
you and I were there in the the ground floor of the exhibition place and just looking around
commenting on how many people we knew from the podcasting thing and you know all of a sudden
or a mess walks in behind us you know Karen we are having a chat with Karen and you know
other people it's very very weird and surreal. Absolutely I was not expecting to
I thought you were joking when you said oh look there's RMS and there he was his largest life yeah.
Yes and nobody started singing the pre-salker song. We will rectify that today
okay moving on first time host Kevin kind of taking a look at a various CD ripping software
all kind of an interesting approach actually. Yes my favourite K3B was left out.
I noticed that I noticed that yeah it's the one when I use if I ever do use one.
I actually love K3B as a tool it was on the par with all
and not audacity but um what was that MP3 music player sorry I'm very very very tired.
Amarok. Amarok and K3B were the two most have applications on KD when KD was there.
Yes yes absolutely. He took the approach of right it's working it's working perfectly
we're now just going to not mess with it anymore but Amarok went off and threw everything out
and started again and messed the whole lot up. It's a pile of rubbish now and right
not to put too fine a point on it yeah absolutely. I actually had a my brother who was completely
anti you know deliberately anti everything Linux and running a machine with Amarok. I'm not
you know Amarok won because of such a cool up at the time but only there's a good good
episode very good idea and one thing that I bogged me about Kevin's and
unseen studios episodes is I can't speed up the audio because of the music.
Excellent music and I want them to have a feed of just music all music from all the shows
in the particular we can put that out on a separate feed and that way I won't feel guilty about
speeding up the music. Yeah so I'm not surprised you said that but I thought it was quite nice
to have a bit of music for a perchanged and it's it's very much kevvy style. Absolutely which is
super. I don't must say the the secretive commons folder in my media player is quite full of stuff
that I picked up from kevvy one way or another. Oh yes oh yes. And we had Jeff Powers
aka gigazine introducing the various different sites associated with that.
Yeah I thought this was quite quite a professional sounding setup. These guys do
quite a lot of this this stuff I think don't they? Absolutely yeah. Not a content that's
particularly mine. Not something on particular interest is what I'm trying to say but you know
we'll turn it to them. Yeah each to their own indeed and but this yeah again there will be
sports with me high in my list of stuff but I'm sure it takes all sorts you know.
Okay the following day Libra Office Calc page styles and page settings in the Libra Office
we had that discussion actually about why doesn't the Libra Office people why don't we
burn them DVDs of of Kevin's series actually and drop them off with pasta might do that next year
actually as a as a collaboration thing as I've got spindles about business spindles of DVDs here
I could burn the money. Yeah absolutely great idea. Yes now I've just signed myself up to another
six weeks of work and moving on 17 or six cross compilers part one what it is and why am I
needed by Mr. Mike Ray turning out to be a very this was a great episode really explains
nice and clearly to me what was going on. Yes yes indeed no Mike's very good at doing this in
in a sort of calm and reasoned way well well structured way yeah and sorry I just got
struck with a cough and that anyway yeah I thought Mike did a great job here enjoy his style of
show. Yeah the 15 hours versus 15 minutes thing got me so yeah hadn't read that.
Okay the following day tour of my desk is up very nice from Beaser this is one that quite a lot
of people should do actually I wouldn't have thought of myself when I heard a lot of the things
that he was using I wouldn't have settled on myself but again that is the beauty of a free
desktop and I remember all back in the day when I learned there were you know you'd you'd
install something like Sousa and you get to two DVDs and every application you would have
separate application for word processors and a separate application menu for DVD burners and every
possible DVD option was there a DVD burning option taken talked about Kelly's episode
and it was only when the booting came online that the fashion to strip it down and only put in one
option for a particular desktop coming to play. Absolutely yes yes I when I first got access to
Linux Red Hat or something like that was years ago I just went and went mad and loaded everything
just grabbed everything there was just to play around with it you know so and then probably
through through stuff away I'll never used it and with menus stuffed with things I never used but
no it's it's it's good to hear somebody who's maybe been through that and and come up with a set
of recommendations passing on his his experience that's that's really cool. Yeah I have a list like
this on my on my website just to remind myself it's basically enough to get or a human stall and
then copy and paste every time I reinstall and as I reinstall it every you know usually there
goes there's a year or two in between I you know given you desktop or you laptop or something
for someone in the family that I there's a few things that I've decided not to use anymore
or decided to use again so very good very good idea yes a good one for all those out there
who are thinking gosh I don't know what show to do now that's true actually just just as an aside
I was intrigued that he's a fan of Lazarus have you ever used that say Pascal yeah Pascal a bit like
ball the ball and is it ball and the Delphi Delphi package yeah I was I was reading that in the
show notes as a post and I was thinking I know this I know this what is that I did it one time
start playing around with when I was at work I was looking for an application I could write
data-based apps in that I could hand out to people in the in my department and I tried Lazarus
and I found it was damn good actually you can write postgres tools in it reasonably well
you're not using pearls Dave
sometimes you have to compile things you know it's just the way of it
very nice yeah sometimes you want you want gooey's as well as the other things yeah pearls
not so good at fancy gooey remind me actually have another project on I want to
pick your brains for as long as I think I'm just out really bit I'm a problem you just ask
it on the mail list yes 17.08 mr. lazy himself JWP I'm too good he emailed me a show we had a
big discussion about this at post them without show notes JWP you know what you want quick
and but it was a good it's good you also brought up something completely different in the middle
of that it was the nano episode and there was something else that I thought I really want to
comment on that oh yes the LPI books yes yes I know I was just looking for my notes because I
noted that as well yeah he said he did the LPI exam at frost him what I want to know what happened
yeah so do I junior next month and you'll find out you're on hackable review anyway 17.09
hacking your teeth I'm really glad I'm glad Mr. X did this and I'm really glad it's not the
show that I thought it was going to be yeah it's soldering on stuff sensors to your teeth
but he made me a bit paranoid I couldn't take on any of the links because I was listening to
those was in the boss oh dear what am I what am I missing here exactly that was the notes I made
here is must buy into dental brushes which I don't have any they're like I'm just looking at the
the picture here on Wikipedia and they are like really long in long-term brushes they're not
like your typical toothbrush like piece of wire that's straight up with brush coming out
yeah yeah it's I don't know where you get them actually but it looks like something that
it's worth investing in it looks like it's something better to use than floss you know I've never
got on very well with that stuff it was breaks yes indeed we thought we'd be discussing teeth
and it's there we go here we go and is it of interest to hackers Dave absolutely absolutely
well this hacker anyway there you go I like Mr. X's episodes he called me just older anyway
yes today 1710 remote desktop new Linux and I recorded this with easy voice recorder pro I was
I had three biological alarm clocks going off the whole night so I couldn't go back to sleep so
I went to work early and then recorded this on the way yes I thought maybe you were the kids
asleep next door or something you you seem to be speaking very quietly into but it worked well
yeah it wasn't too bad it wasn't too bad I don't I guess you have any call for for this this
type of thing I don't need to access any windows machines hooray mind you I did at one point in my
in my life but not anymore but it's it's it's interesting but just just academically interesting
indeed it's funny actually we're talking about old podcasts the the lots of Linux links I show
I sadly miss deviates there's always a home for you here Dave and we had that base name dollar zero
trick and to find out the name of the script and then you could you know just call server one
and then it calls a bash script and the bash script knowing what its name is will do something
based on the case statement is it fantastic phenomenally cool trick so I think I know that I got
the x or and r tip from some other show I think probably tattoo or somebody so this this particular
script is nothing but a mishmash of the bash things that I I found another podcast but that
is the way it is isn't it I mean we we all have I'm sure we all have bits and pieces of scripts
and stuff that we've gleaned from other people's work and and that's that's the way you learn
it's it's a fantastic way to learn to I must admit I did cut and paste your x or and r things just
to see what they did because they looked quite cool I wasn't quite sure why you use so many
tools in there but I just keep my keep my mouth shut this time to to in answer to your and
micro a is discussion about not using expat it's because I didn't know how to do it on the other
a day so if you can if you can come up with a nicer way of doing of them please please please please
paste it into the show notes for this actually I around comment on the show notes
it worked how might do that yeah yeah yeah of course we again we all do this but I tend to look
back at them later on and think oh why did I do it that way I can think much better we're doing
it now and then go and hack it and make it make it work slightly better just just because that's
the way my brain works unfortunately yeah that's that's exactly it I found loads of like this one
still uses the backticks to find it's server equals backtick base name whereas now I've completely
switched to always use and dollar or open parentheses the command flows parentheses because you can
you can nest those whereas backticks you can't and backticks is not obvious what's going on whereas
I think it's more obvious if you use the dollar braces thing yeah I agree I agree very much so I
happened to do this script as sold I can actually tell how old some of my scripts are by my
coding styles at a particular time but there was one thing I did that there's been bugging a lot
of people and it's been getting no attention is the our desktop command is completely not supporting
windows windows 2008 with with the newer security search requirements and so that's why I went out to
look for something else an x3 or dp seems to be a pretty good solution yeah cool so I know I know a
lot of people if you're being bugged by this you you're going to like this show otherwise you
ask one of the ones you're good at I imagine it's actually one of just just referring forward to
to some of the comments the business of knowing that there might be something on hpr that you could
go and search through and find an answer to your problem is it's always good so you know it's
always good to have these sorts of things as a resource I think absolutely okay and then we have
1711 which was Swift 110 or 110 or however he introduces himself and they've gone through some
video software which was unimpressive and it was only later on that I realized it was a video
recording recording software yeah he made first of all I didn't know who was who it was one thing
but I know it was him and his brother but I couldn't work out who it was who but they kept referring
to you'll see it in the video and stuff and of course they never linked to the video so that was
slightly sad but there you go absolutely was a yeah a follow up episode will be absolutely excellent
I use a I've used fffmpeg or empler for that ffmpeg and I also have a a command line script as well
which you may do a show about that just does that and the records are very good and then we have
Mike with what's in my crate taking the not to be outdone by the rest was with our with our bag
so he has a crate and I could see him I could visualize very much in my mind how his his crate was
was being put together yeah he described it very well I was I also used those 35 liter boxes got loads
of them in the house for all sorts of stuff they stack beautifully so yeah I was able to to
visualize what he was talking about very very well I think I even followed up some of his links
there thinking some of those bits and pieces sounded interesting like the speakers so very good
they um over here in the Netherlands most people use the uh Albert Hine boxes which is you know
a plastic crate that's the equivalent of test goal users for home delivery so all right we
ran this part of the world there's not much of that type of thing they used to be a supermarket
called Safeways which has gone bust um which had a had a box of which I have many um but they they're
not stackable so they're not as useful as these guys all right yeah yeah okay then we had um
1730 to be frank interviews Aaron Roomsson free software foundation Europe and tour project and
it was like as if he had gone out of his way to record the ones that I had missed I'm really really
glad that he included these into the into the episode absolutely yeah they were they were good
interviews I found them most most intriguing I liked the I liked his questions to you know about
the British government responding by saying oh look a bad thing happened oh I know let's
let's stop encryption let's uh we have cameras in every house or something
yes yeah good very good point you made there absolutely I've been hints 001 about time Dave about time
yes well I um yeah I don't know whether I've set this at too low a level I we're really
hesitated a long time thinking about I've been thinking about this for a year or more
thinking it would be quite nice to pass on some of this stuff but it's a hard subject to talk
about and you really need to start from from you know ground ground zero type of thing I feel but
when I listen to it I've got this guy's boring what is he on about no no not at all because you know
you're landed a server and there's nothing but vim there it's a very very very scary world
well I've been there and I've watched other people doing this as well and sort of
fumbling about with the vim and then crashing out of it not knowing how to get out of it and
ending up with bits and pieces all over the place or you know with the thing that can move around
very rapidly just going cursor up up up up up up up multiple times and and you know so I thought
well if I base it around um that sort of scenario then uh it's it might might turn out to be
useful series to do so anyway we'll see it was higher my list of requested topics to you in
particular I still don't know why the HJK and um I know why they are there but I don't know why
in this day and age you can't assume that there's arrow keys on the keyboard I I put it down to
the quality of typist that you are because uh it's I think my son for example he's taught
himself touch typing is a very fast typist um he I think that that sort of approach appeals to him
whereas me as I said in the podcast is more of a hunt and peck old old geezer type of typist
I don't use that at all um but you know I don't know yeah easy arrow keys and a bit of mouse
and stuff like that okay so okay I need to learn to touch up and a question for the education
system in general why the hell are people giving schools laptops or yeah kids laptops
given them iPads and not teaching them to type like seriously folks what what is going on with
the education system but the still typing is still not a required subject very much so very much
so I mean it used to be a thing that only girls did because they were going to be secretaries
weren't they and you know so they had to learn to and to type on a on a on a typewriter of course
but yeah it's it's it's mad because keyboard skills are so important today
and uh yeah I just have no idea why that is not in place
honey enough about that the final show I think is 1715 is that correct
that's right yep liberal office cell styles also good he um in the series finally
have figured out how to change that annoying thing where you can print grid lines on your
spreadsheets because every single time I have to go and change that and I never it never dorm to
meet that it would be in the style sheet that you could change it I yeah I really got to follow
this one up and learn learn more from this I was I was listening trouble with with who could
well I say trouble with I mean the thing about who could some episodes is you've really got to be
sat down there with an instance of of Calc running in front of you to really get the most out of it
and I'm not always that that good at doing that but yeah I quite agree there's there's so much in
there and he's he's he's pointing out all of this really cool stuff um and uh you know it's
going to be so useful I think absolutely I don't know I probably in my past I've used uh
spreadsheet programs so often that I know the menus inside and out from everywhere you know
and it never just took me to go so when I hear your shows I'm doing whatever I'm doing but the
the application is floating in front of my head if you don't want to me oh I do very much so yeah
all righty with a new and approved mailing this discussion Dave I just want to take some time out
here to absolutely thank you for the script for making the show notes for these episodes it was
a pain in the hours to doing this every month and now you have completely taken it over and
the north's look fantastic so thank you very much thank you oh that's very kind of you I uh
I'm afraid I'm that sort of a perfectionist that I've really got to get this look in as good as I can
and uh so the adding the mailing list stuff it's been on my my to do list for a long long time
and it is a mark it'd be difficult at least for me to do um that anyway I think we've we've maybe
got a got a solution this time we'll see see let's try using the damn thing and see see whether it works
yeah I uh unfortunately Dave I'm also an evil manipular sort of dish so um knowing that about you
I quite often put things in your way knowing that it will bug you so much that you were going to
do this for me so my apologies for taking advantage uh yeah well what can I say it's it's
meat and drink really I love I quite enjoy being bugged by the by this piece of grit and then try
and make a pearl out of it oh that's about you um but you know it's um yeah yeah this
that should I should I should I use the opportunity to rant slightly about
term yield free to email and and stuff right so what I tried to do was um I discovered that
a g main system offers an interface where you can go and download a bunch of messages
and then you get it in a mailbox format well I know how to read mailbox formats I did lots of
work on mail when I was uh when I was some employed um so I thought okay well what I'll do is I'll
go and pull down the messages in this format and then write a script to process them and then
process them into threads and um display the threads so we can follow them in the note um well
I discovered that making threat joining them the messages up with as threads turned out to be
quite difficult because in many cases uh people are not replying to messages they're simply
typing a brand new message with the same subject header as um the original with with a
a re on the front of it um but not using the reply function in whatever mail client they have
so it means that the message is unthreaded doing a new one yeah yeah because well it's the only
explanation I can I can think of because you know how messages you know how threads are constructed
there are headers in the message which refer back to the to the message idea of the
the previous message so the parent message is referred back to you know in a in a header
there are actually two types of header I don't want to shut me up if I'm going going on too much but
uh you are bordering on doing a show about some message uh well I could but I I feel that maybe
a lot of people would would switch off but um it's um anyway you only get those those links
if you use the reply type functions within your mail client if you and the only the only thing
I can assume is that people are not in some cases rare fairly rare cases I must admit are not
using these these features and therefore the messages are turning into sort of orphan things
which which are not properly threaded I noticed that G main um tries to resolve these so I came up
with an algorithm to do it myself by looking finding an orphaned message then looking for the subject
line back through all the other messages to work out where it would fit in the scheme of things
I think a more or less got it um working but um but the one that I can't thread is the one where
they don't reply and they change the subject line that that mean that and neither can G main I
noticed so you're stuffed with that one the other one that I can't deal with is if you reply to
a um a digest message because the digest messages are not threaded at all um uh so
so the other the other uh moan um get off my lawn it is um that sometimes people don't start a new
thread when they should and what they do is they reply to an existing thread and change the subject
line well I haven't tried to do anything about those because it's just too difficult it's just
impossible I think to resolve that one but you know if you're starting a new thread starting off
a new subject then just create a brand new message rather than relying could you more mess inside
I don't know I've done I've done what you just described uh from time to time do you think you could
put a show together about mailing your statics please yeah okay okay yes yes you you might need to
bet it so I don't get too ranty because I get madly irritated by this I can we can put a link into
that to show on the mailing list you know sign up page or something yeah I I used to be the manager
of the the team that um ran the mail system for uh small university in Edinburgh and uh the way
that people used email used to really really annoy me and uh so so so I have to be careful I don't
let my uh pent up irritation loose if you title that section as a rant of Dave then we all know
what's coming uh yeah when you hear me screaming then you'll know just just just just fast forward
that bit all right so we had um Charles Taylor with the hacker public radio dot com squatter occupied
look alike domain is available and um to which I replied that uh yeah I have a done but I had
done back order for a long time from go daddy was um yeah eventually we got us although go daddy
if you want a rant are the reason I want to go daddy is that I was registered with go daddy um they
are deliberately uh obfuscating the whole process because you you don't know if you're if you're
the winning bid so I expected that I would put on a you know by the by this domain when it becomes
available you would imagine that that would be purchase of the domain but then they when it became
available they put it into action so then I was very close to bidding on myself so I've it wasn't
clear anywhere in the in the um control panel that I had but you know what the process was and
what was happening is very uh horrible horrible interference yeah capitalism I guess yeah well
capitalism is doesn't need to be screwing your customer you know capitalism is is a balance between
you and your customer and both of you getting your fair deal out of what's happening uh
screwing customers over isn't capitalism it is screwing your customer over so that they go away
from you and never want to come back again ever yeah anyway it's pretty foul I agree to quote
fringy uh it's not good the rules of acquisition audio book club it's going out late uh mature rules
I've started listening to it myself it will be uh February the 10th that's right yeah that's not
all really happened it's already happened I guess yes it being the 28th the day yes
excellent stuff excellent stuff
then we had uh Ivan um who is epic house uh I assumed that he has I assumed his handle there
I hope I'm not not wrong in this but I assumed it was meant to be pronounced Ivan Privacy
which sounds it sounds I think that's another amusing pun oh do you think I don't know is that
not just right real name I don't know I don't know epic house I don't know I don't know either either
or I actually as you can see by reading this thread I find his emails very confusing to follow
it is uh I mean I got the wrong answer the stick with this and again apologies to um
Ivan for this um mess up basically um he was uh requesting feedback on a show that he did
and I somehow walked that bat into thinking that he was requesting that we changed the encoding
for every show in the netter so um let's talk about that the better I think uh it's been a long one
yeah it he I think he was sort of um how to put it suggesting that maybe some uh metadata could
be added that's not currently in the shows but I don't think that was that should be conflated with
you know does some of this metadata in my show blow your your player up there's more that uh
you know we we we only put out the core stuff in in um HBR shows yeah yeah we do but there's a reason
for that and that reason became very apparent when I was going back editing all the shows from
today with a techie and stuff the audio that is submitted or has been in the past now it's
it's fairly standard because we have a page that shows people you know this is this is recording
this is the settings in audacity and most media players are saying that but back when we started
nine years ago mp3 was a new massively new thing and the you would get shows in that had like audio
in one channel or that was completely busy or that was warp slow because the encoding rate was
was wrong really for for the crack someone just go and download some of the today with a techie
episodes and open them in audacity and I'm just have a look like there's a DC offset on on some
of the shows it's like bizarre so a lot of them when I when I started working on this we were getting
we're getting a lot of complaints from people about shows not playing and I went back and had a
look I actually ended up going back and adding reencoding things from mp3 to organ speaks and a
lot of them failed at that time so I ended up having to download the mp3s at that time of the shows
that were causing issues open them in audacity and basically fix them and we post them so I did
that for hpr but hgr shows and not for today but a techie but yeah but that has since ironed out
because we basically take everything regardless of what it is and turn it into a roll pcm file
so if it's wild, flack, whatever it just everything gets stripped out and we just push
put it into a roll pcm file and then from there we can convert it into everything else but
that said I was really thinking the fast m episodes will be wound for chapter marks would really
have been handy yeah yeah great i agree as i did go to a lot of trouble to put the chapter marks
in on the website so if you play them on the website and you go to any of the interviews the
all you need to do is put the hash octetore symbol pound sign whatever you use and t equals
the star time and then comma the end time and you'll be able to when you press play it will jump
forward to that section of the audio file and just play that which is really nice and that would
be nice to have on audio players that would support that okay um I mentioned I reserved a
slot for uh 2015 0401 and we have an open series that you will all remember it comes once a year
the open system to connect OSI model so if anyone I was intending on doing this I don't
wonder if I can particularly plan but if anybody would like to record that episode and submit it
just drop me an email please and we will make sure that that gets updated for you
and then I sent on some cross promotional opportunities emails which caused some discussion
I found that quite fascinating actually just just because I went into grumpy old man mode and went
I don't look don't look right to me I thought oh god I'm being it's completely wrong I shouldn't take
the attitude at all and then it seemed that the community sort of agreed to fair to fair extent
is that fair comment yeah some people were were interested in doing it but um to be honest I've seen
this this one came the closest to being an actual real thing um and their size you know
uh we do get quite a lot of uh you know Bob's huge store wants to do cross promotional
opportunities to you and you know it's just a spam it's a spam thing but this one I thought I
I would forward on because it comes very close to the boundary but I had a look as well
at some of the people that they have on their site and you know that you can earn a number of points
and I think there was only 23 people listed and a lot of them didn't have any points at all and
so not sure what's going on there but if somebody wants to record a show and do an interview with
these guys as a show that would be good I think that would be better approach than um and having
them come on and get a such sales bill because you wouldn't get the the top questions in there
now that that's that's an excellent suggestion I like that can I just comment that um this particular
thread um I didn't want to want to have a go at Frank uh Frank Bell who uh who who um hijacked the thread
at the end but you will notice that his comments didn't actually appear as a thread because they're
stuck on the end of this one okay hold on one second oh how does that happen
well if you look at how um G main handled it they've done the same because what he did was he did
reply to an old message and changed the the um subject and so it uh it's it's it's been threaded
is threaded by um by my code it's threaded by G main it's threaded by any any thread aware
may not as being part of that thread I will don't pick frankly out for that I've done that lots of
no no no no no that's why I know not to do it again Dave I know not to do it again it's just uh
it's just you lose in in this world of threaded messages then you get lost in in especially if
you attach yourself to a large thread um people people don't see your messages uh um if they
look at stuff after the event I'm really sure now you definitely need to do a um do an episode
because you know about threading and how it works because if you know how it works then we know
what to do and what not to do yeah so yeah okay uh Frank uh he's asking about the intro and outro and um
uh and about the ftp server so the ftp uh count has been changed since then if you want us you
email admin and hackbookagradio.org although I prefer people to go to the website and even if
you want to upload via ftp you can just reserve your um days fill in the information for the show
notes and then um if you don't upload any file or provide a URL then you you get emails using them
and password for the ftp site as well as my home address so that you can uh deliver the uh if you
want to post a show in from a non-disclose location. That's pretty cool. Also I see that uh lost
from Bronx one didn't get picked up on the Jimin thing for the cross promotional offer.
Yeah that was a case where he has um he has uh what did he do that I did make a note of this
he replied to uh he no he didn't reply to a previous message and he changed the subject line
so both my code and Jimin's code can't join his message in with the the thread that that was the
problem there okay not worry I mean it's better than what it's it's fine we get it here so that's
fine um then the next one was from me hubbypublicradio.com.net.org are redirecting to
hackupublicradio.org actually they're not they're doing more than that if you go to hubbypublicradio.com
or hubbypublicradio.net or hubbypublicradio.org you're brought to a completely different site
that has nothing to do with hackers at all and those sites will be um those sites will be
will have the text hacker will have very similar text to what's on hackerpublicradio
except it'll be replaced with hubbypublicradio. That's very impressive
which is fun to do I must say and it's been a long time in the office because I've heard from people
that if they're at their work then they can access the HPR website the hackerpublicradio website
because they've got multi-word hacker in it uh so now you should be able to just go to hubbypublicradio.org
for instance and get to the content you will not be able to upload a show because
I have lots of checks and they're specifically for domain names and I don't want to make it more
complicated in addition to that um the emailing aspect it won't work because it comes from
hackerpublicradio.org and in any event I'm thinking the use case where people are uploading
in work is kind of relatively small I can understand why somebody might want to download a show
to listen in work but uploading show from work seems a bit odd especially if that environment
is blocking access to HPR on the first place and on the side note if you are if you are working
in an environment that is has a third-party provider that is blocking us not that the environment
themselves are blocking us but the third-party provider is blocking us please contact me so that I
can contact their provider I've done this on a few occasions and when they get a phone call from
somebody asking them why this service that's been of the you know that's has been all support
to the community has been blocked and given all the contents that we have and that we're we've
interviewed several found in figures blah blah blah and we've interviewed people from IBM and
RMS and blah blah blah that they're very very very very very very quick about on blocking us so
just keep that in mind folks and the next one was a bug report that's found and I fixed
Mike has a topic request about automake and I think you replied to this I voted on the list and
Platoon replied that there was a show about that by Needle and you replied to that as well
No I didn't add anything useful to the to the discussion I simply responded to your comment
about trying to break my threading algorithm that's all I hope you see Dave I play with your mind
I can't yeah yeah yeah you challenged me I have to come back something I'm afraid
and then we have the one obviously about the show notes and the one about 5150
having trouble submitting shows now we've done a lot of investigation on this topic and
quite a lot of it is off is now off the mailing list because I went through the log files the Apache
log files to see what was going on with them 5150 and also Kevin seemed to have this and I think
we're close to identifying the issue it's not it's not the the website itself is basic HTML we have
php render the HTML but the HTML is backward compatible I even tried it on a miss on the
new mosaic browser so there's nothing special about that any of the HTML 5 stuff should be ignored
by previous browsers and as part of the specs so that's all good so long as you fill in the
required fields you're not gonna have problems because I check for stuff like if if they're
supposed to be 12 fields and only 10 get filled in then it can't have come through the website
so it was a good exercise for me to go through this um but I couldn't I couldn't find anything
particular um that was going on that's that what seems strange but they're one thing that's um
5150 and Kevin uh uh who could have in common are is that they were both uploading multiple
episodes and we begin to think now that it's something to do with uh the caching on the browser
on their side or perhaps um that need to refresh or something like that or the back button is
uh you know it's back button has been used and it doesn't uh get a new page from the website
so the website is saying it's okay that the page hasn't been refreshed or it's possibly something
like they when you type in in the URL that is also fills in the previous uh page that was there
which was the confirmation page and once you go there you get a 412 or um permission tonight
but I will say this two things of note very important one is that as soon as you see that you
post a shown it gives you the thank you page you should have an email in your inbox if you don't
can you check your spam folders and JWP has reported that there's an issue with hotmail and
5150 also had some of his emails uh confirmation emails going to a spam folder so um I'm going to
be putting some information about that onto the website as well um just so that we can I'm
going to see if there's a way of getting those email addresses white white listed by uh individual
services but I think we're close to fix them to to to seeing this uh fixed I hope yeah very good
and finally we had um uh Josh uh knapp who's the um uh basically the the patron of HPR
and bin rev and associated projects he is at anonestools.com and onestools.com and they provide all
this stuff for free and you have no idea the amount of work that this chap does in the background
so he's got some new firewall rules and intrusion detection stuff in uh to stop a lot of
attacks and you know even when we were troubleshooting this issue you'd see all the stuff that's
going on um I don't know if people realize how many um many people are trying to jokers are trying
to uh avail of our services trailing the website and pulling down you know take a mirror of HPR
is absolutely fine there's easier ways to do it and we want to make that possible but um yeah
there's lots of people trying to do um interesting stuff shall we say and uh 5150 did make a point that
saying are you trying to attack the show in the in the in an error message that can come up
is a bit off-potting so as part of that I fixed the error page that you're likely to see a lot less
error uh freaky and then put some hidden comments in for the those scriptkitties amongst us who wish
to record shows for us and by the way if you get as far as the upload page uh then you've already
got past josh's uh joshest off and you're into my zone so if you can't upload then it's entirely
due to me so if you can't upload for any reason please email admin at hackerpublicradio.org
remember I'm in a different time zone to you probably so uh allow 24 hours for to go through
what is very useful is the show number that you were trying to upload um a history of the steps
that you went through I was trying to upload on this page then I clicked this and I went in here
then I got this so I didn't get the email this error appeared and especially on the upload page
itself there will be an md5 uh string um given that will describe exactly what uh it's it's an
error code and if you can paste that to me as well that will tell me where in the process uh you're
having problems and we can also look at the logs and stuff and see uh see exactly what's going on but
for the most people I think there's been about 15 to 20 people who have now uploaded via the website
so it seems to be gone okay I think yeah I've had no problems apart from
the one email dropping in my spam folder as well so uh tombstones it's work fine for me
yeah I don't know how to um the caching I can get around because I can retry your caching
and browsers could technically do something on the thank you page I can leave that up for a few
seconds and then have it auto redirected to somewhere else or I can have a click here button that
will bring people back to the homepage so then the last page that they were asked was the homepage
and then I can force then uh a that the calendar page is also always refreshed on every
um you know you force to refresh every time you go into that page uh whether the browser is on
the last one after another thing was um uh again also put in messages about press F5 and stuff um
do you think a show will be yeah on a cool mask do you think a show yes is the answer all right I
better do a show on the upload process the the other thought I'd had was that uh some sort of
diagrammatic thing to to show how to do this but uh then I thought oh yeah well who's going to do it
um I I tend to try and do that for us
yeah so okay a braille a braille diagram would be you know what I would love to see is a uh
I'd love to see in court uh drink is a um or time what was that that we're doing on the new
show uh you know uh a accessibility to this was really cool uh I would love to actually use one of
those to uh to see how it works to see what it feels like you know browsing through a thing of text
that will be cool yeah my description of his little braille um device forget what he called it
was was fascinating because he was saying that it you effectively feel it and and and move your
your mouse cursor over your screen and then then it turns it into braille what's under the
mouse cursor which is just an amazing concept yep absolutely okay there were 17 comments this month
first one was on episode 15 22 back in uh 2014 06 it was how to use darker containers on Linux
and I've said it before and I'll say it again yeah people HVR is a gold mine there you you
you don't know when your shows are going to be listened to so this is how to use darker Linux
and the comment from was from Wendigo about creating a bridge interface and they
command to do that is ip space link space add space br 0 space type space bridge so thanks
let me go for that one pretty cool and mr morris had one on coffee do you want to give us a
rundown I'm drowning in comments here I'm trying to draw two tabs at once yeah I know I'm with you
I'm with you so um uh somebody with the handle 1093 i3511 uh said that we're commented on a
a um an alternative way of uh um making espresso coffee with a device that that used an
electric um element to to heat the water uh a rommel's bacher assume echo 366 um and it
it does look very cool it looks very nice it does yeah my only problem with it was the uh
little beletti that i that i use um costs about i think it was about 15 pounds when i bought it
about 20 pounds on amazon right now in the uk um whereas the rommel's bacher is uh 73 pounds on
um on amazon uk yeah yeah yeah i i'm i'm just you know it's if you if you didn't have a stove
it would be an amazing thing to have but uh i'm not sure i'd pay that much yeah beside your bed
coffee i'm sure no expenses per day if if anybody wants to buy me one i'll put it on my wish list
you know and uh just just go for it go ahead uh uh Charles replied to page need as an alternative
to marketplaces to lost and bronx episode 1683 and he proposed the idea of uh crowdsourcing
patronage it kind of seems like you know um uh i immediately sprang to mind the requesting for
donations uh like they do on uh escape pod both that's kind of more um that's a different
thing he he's talking about uh something like kickstarter or something like that which could work
i guess um common to on episode 1687 back in jangry of this year by tasha tasha sara tasha thank you
says yeah by mark waters we simply said thanks for sharing the opml so pretty good
is that mic waters or mark waters it's mark waters okay because i was thinking it might be mark
waters who did the uh water swimming in france show so um comment on fostering three of five
from 5150 play that funky music and obviously 50 doesn't read the show notes because in every show
notes as you should for acrylic commons music i gave uh all the copyrights including everybody who's
playing in us and as i am required to do under the license so that was there and then we had an
episode uh above from migray thanks for asking the right questions and uh mostly because i
solicited mike's important uh everybody else's inputs uh on the on the first part i unfortunately
didn't get to ask questions of the do do linux chap because uh for one thing in another completely
completely set my mind if i'm being through through through to the honest and sometimes you can
you come up against somebody who is um how how let's say this uh devoting a lot of their free time and
you you feel feel a lot bad uh i i didn't ask them to have tough questions because i forgot
about it but it's a lot easier to ask tough questions on somebody who's wearing a suit and being
paged to go there by their company and all the rest if you know what i mean do you know what i mean
oh absolutely yes yes you you don't really want to slap effectively slap the guy down
but you know and and squashes enthusiasm you know you're hearing in an interview like that
and yeah exactly and there's like two people working on the project themselves and another guy
you know so yeah other projects i have no problem asking the questions uh the tough questions
yeah are you so yes uh i feel embarrassed reading out the comments for the next one so
that's uh if you want to do a date yes uh this is um comments on show 1700 and uh which went down
very very well as uh we already uh discovered i think um we have Mike Ray saying
this this was Ken's um everybody's name being intro show being stitched together that we spoke about
before uh Mike Ray says such a parcel of rogues which is which is an interesting
quality true enough brilliant amount of beat of editing he says which which you can only only
agree with um we have fifty one fifty if it's fifty what's going to be this episode uh comment
actually um just nailed it for me all the thanks for the great episode everyone uh everything one
needs to know about hgur in ten minutes that uh just uh put a smile on my face for the whole day
i'm fascinated with people's handles i'd love to know how people come up with with them
i mean i have no originality at all therefore i never came up with one myself so just uh if
fascinates me uh people actually saying them out loud and stuff is a it's a great thing
i'm what was amazing to me was how many people don't put their handle in the show don't even introduce
themselves i i don't know i always hello this is Ken follow no blah blah blah blah but the amount of
people who i you know i had to get a list of all the people that the might have done five or six
different shows and every single one of them just went straight into the text hi this is the text
and i'm doing the text and then eventually on the final show or second to last show at the end of
the episode they say their name and with a few people i actually cheetahs and had to get their
a recording of them from other podcasters who i knew had interviewed them and they had said their
name on the other shows so i had to cut it from there and put it into hp artist oh my god
it just just gives us some insight into the matter work that we're into this Ken
amazing and then i edited all this and then all of a sudden like yeah uh because as i was saying
about the toata tech episodes you had like chipmunk sounding ones then you had ones going into your
left ear and you're right here so that i had to go and edit all of them and uh i had actually asked
i was thinking i was going to do this with a script but then the only way the only way you could
get to do this was to was to visualize it in audacity and you know kind of guess there's this
end of the intro and there's the start of an intro one so it was just i was weeks
weeks literally weeks doing this yeah absolutely but it's me i was going to say michael
mich michael it's that insious i don't know if it isn't i um says thank you Ken this episode made
me smile that's just a great comment you know and imagine the amount of work you put into the
episode he says thank you for all the work you do for the community well i intend to uh don't
it's very nice what's uh and then epicanos came in with the uh with another uh absolutely
another comment of us it's nice to hear um as he says himself yes he uh he did say that it still
takes eight minutes to get through all the people introducing themselves um which is fantastic
you know it really does it really does bring it home to you um what we have here it's it's amazing
like when you go to at first and you can go up to people and and they were going okay who are you
and how are you community driven well i got this question before people would talk to us
we are a community podcast network what does community mean well community means we've had
2000 episodes and we've had uh 200 and uh 264 contributors if you want to be 265
you can submit a show tomorrow so it's kind of good way to keep it all open absolutely
and the last the last comment was from jm who says great work i was giggling when i heard my name
goodbye which is quite a nice comment to go on sorry no i'm just going to say that that
business of sitting there listening with great anticipation for your own name to to come up is
you know something i'm sure everybody feels at some point i just thought you put it rather well
absolutely yeah and i tried to get the first time people said this so that was my you know
i said my name it was the first time i'd ever done a podcast ever now this is this is my first show
and oh my god what was it do would people listen to me you know what's the end of the world so yeah
everybody uh everybody's a little bit nervous i think i'm the first to
and what it was terrified was not that i for the first time i think ever i was worried that we
were going to get new holes in between uh the time i finished editing and then uh got to frost
because i knew that there was those going to be episodes and i was worried that people would have
submitted the shows before it went off of course that did not oh yeah yeah as would be
horrible to uh yeah to have submitted the show prior to episode 1700 not have your name included
so the following uh we had a comment on 1702 which was the one of the first time episodes
regarding my interview with reactOS um really enjoyed the uh his enthusiasm and stuff
love the project i love i love this comment actually the uh i did like the the guy's um accent
which and his his uh his enthusiasm as well so yeah more interviews with him with the comment
yeah absolutely so the next one is a uh is a comment from uh my
kebi's episode about open source cv-rippers and there was uh missing k k3b from the list
i don't know already spoken about that and um charles nice and formative about cv-rippers and he
enjoyed the intermission music as well as did i i thought you'd be on a lot of feet
so 1707 was a tour uh my desktop and um marcia mellows wrote in to say great job great deliberately
adequate sound quality informative content good going vis-ra and looking forward to more
b-ser i think he meant to say that of course that of course is why i did this editing because
i do plan to post that wildfile beside everybody's name that anytime somebody's names come up we can
hear they're they're actual name so i want me to do this at more the tradition of me butchering
people's names will be over yeah uh that's a sound like a great project there you go and we had a
comment on uh you and me commented on my episode about uh the new windows desktop and he said uh
thanks for sharing it that there's an alternative to our desktop because he's getting the cred ssp
required by server messages and you don't get them with that and you're very welcome servant very
very long and Dave i must say i really like the ordering of the comments this month i know we to
go on about this so much for the last few months and now people are fed up about it but it does
make it a lot easier to work through the comments i think yes i yes i think uh well it was your
suggestion to to put them in this order um i simply went with the order that we'd already had
elsewhere uh but i never felt it was right um so i think we got it right now so the only thing i
will maybe do with it i'm not sure if it will be useful for for people reading this but it's
only be useful for us when we're uh we're doing this or doing the recording is to make the links
if i can make the links in the comments go to the comments and stuff rather than the top of the
the episode what do you think sorry completely miss that sorry you were going to have the
the the links that are in the comment list right so hbr1522 takes you to the the page of the
episode on i thought if i put the the hash comment or whatever it is on the end of that url
absolutely drop it down to the comment i was just going to email you about that today but it felt
bad because you had you had just uh updated the order but yes that would be actually quite cool
yeah okay well since i i suggested it i'll do it definitely but if you had the link from the i
think the link to the episode page is pretty good because then when we're reading it out you can
really get a summary of especially for the old ones uh you know if we get a comment on something
from 2013 for instance you have no idea what episode you know zero nine four three was but
if the one two three on the side are actual links to the comments one you know comment one coming
two coming three that would be good do you know what i get you are they addressable the
individual comment but you will find out no that well absolutely absolutely i will look into this
and if they're not then the guy behind the the system can maybe make them so i don't know
there you go what's the one you're shooting next one for
common systems or davin came oh yes okay by the way folks this is an open uh open show i think we've
driven uh fifty one fifty and a who go away last uh and it's opened to anybody in the community
and it doesn't we're not married to this time if there's a group of you one or two one two whatever
want to do this show everything that you need is on the show notes page which is updated
before time so the only thing you need to do is have bread the shows follow the mailing list a
little and uh you you too can do this show unfortunately it doesn't count for your one show year
thanks yeah these these notes are obviously available uh usually quite in advance of the
natural recording so just because i'm that sort of a geek i'm afraid
yeah this is type of geek we like so anything other otherwise interesting or cool that
we need to tell the community about i don't have anything else myself
i just had a um okay so um we still need to do some more work on the uh fifty i just got an
email from fifty one fifty about the um four one two or so still need to do a little bit more work
on that but we shall we shall endeavor to persevere and i still haven't put the downloads in that
would be a nice addition to the show notes sorry day oh no what let me die Steve to have the number
of downloads from one side to the show notes all right that's how i will let i will run before
