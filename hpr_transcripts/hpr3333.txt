Hello, good day everyone. Hope y'all are all doing fine and well.
Hey, a second podcast for today, even I can't remember the last time I did two run a day,
but along the theme of devices and such things. On TV, a console that I have, so over the years,
it's got a lot smaller, a lot smaller, so now it has, like I guess I'm a device junkie,
so it has a Chromecast, it has Apple TV, it has a Roku, it has a Skything for my wife to watch
all their German stuff. It has a Windows server connected to it to do all things Apple with media,
if I sold it as I or that was probably a wasted purchase, but it's still a pretty good box.
The PAN64, the original PAN64 laptop is there. I don't use that very much because it's
painfully slow and has a weird keyboard, and it'll probably be a donation next time there's
an odd camp or something. My Microsoft Surface lives behind there, and I don't use that very much either.
I'm not traveling because of COVID that used to be my travel machine, but I find in today's
world that even that Surface 2 is sort of heavy in today's travel world, right? It weighs a lot of
Kilo, and today's travel world, the Karyon luggage, it's topping out, I think about five kilos,
maybe six kilos, eight kilos depending on your airline, so that it's not the last, so to have
a thin tablet that weighs about half Kilo, it seems to be the new thing. So I don't know how long
that'll last, it'll probably last until it dies. It has Windows 10 on it, and so it'll last forever.
Other laptop is a HP stream, and it has Subuntu wallet, and I use it every once in a while,
runs on Blue Moon, I'll pick it up, and again, it's only a two gigabyte RAM on it, and it's terribly,
terribly, terribly slow, even with Blue Moon 2, I don't think it's Blue Moon 2 is on there, I know.
So the reason that I wanted to talk to you all is that I've been quite intrigued by the
pine 64 offerings, and I subscribe to them on Twitter, and they have a lot of different
tweets and things, but I saw the pine phone that had a battery case keyboard attached to it,
and me as a device junkie, if they ever get that keyboard battery thing to work,
that would be just absolutely the cats me out for me, I'd have to get one, and I think you all
can see that I have a lot of devices, and so to get the Linux tablet that the pine 64 has,
or to have the Linux phone is a bit of a stretch for me as to when I would touch it, when I would use it,
when I would use it, and such things, but if you go to their website, it's definitely a very
interesting read on all the things done. I mean, last all camp we went to, they were talking about
the watch, and how they had taken open source things, and now the pine folks were going to make a watch,
and I thought that that was just really, really interesting. Unfortunately, the exome folks
started selling $25 watches that keep track your steps, and so it just seems that the usefulness
of such a thing is other than a free thing is interesting, so if you want to play with it,
you don't want to hack with it, but to wear it every day, and that it doesn't keep track of your
steps, or it doesn't do stopwatch function when you go run, or something like that,
and that it would cost the same as a finished product from Ex only, it's $25, so that,
anyway, let's go to the pine 64 page, so you just go to the pine64.org, and it'll start coming up,
so the first thing that comes up is they have a big splash screen, and prime time comes up, and
prime tab comes up, the clusterboard comes up, the pencil comes up, the pine cell, I'm sorry,
the pine cube comes up, it's an IP camera, that's pretty cool. So obviously, I'm sort of
then graduated with the pine phone, because it might have that keyboard one day,
and the prime tab also looks pretty interesting, it doesn't have a customer list, like that gene
list that I've been reading about so much, and everybody's arraiged, they're trying to do crowd
funding for, but I think that's $120, $130, we'll click down into that, really soon, and if you,
when you go to the, when I met Ken and Dave at Brussels, I'm trying to think of the name of,
we went to Brussels with Ken and Dave, big open source thing in Brussels, they didn't have it,
because of the COVID this year, open sounds, and it'll come to me, but pine had a booth, and they
had their things, and you actually got to touch everything, and I mean, they've really
continued to improve, so the pine 64 community is a large, vibrant, diverse, independent
partner project, developers, hackers, hardware enthusiasts, privacy advocates,
philosophies, you name it, we've got them all, and they contribute to the project,
they're by shaping and determining the course, this page is community run, and as it's wiki,
and chats, and forms as well, and they're always looking for help, and the, if you go down there,
they have a scrolling thing, ah, here it is, here it is, UB ports, UB ports, and Majaro at Fostem,
Fostem 19, so we were all there at Fostem 19, and then COVID came, and they closed it for 2020,
and 2021, there's been none because of the COVID, and so, I'm really looking forward to
when COVID is over, so that maybe I can meet Ken and Dave, and we'll go have a hacker public
radio podcast, maybe at the Fostem, and, and mess around there, and do something, so the, the prime time,
so this is interesting, so again, it's a 1.3 inch, which is a little big, and it's, it's doing,
it runs RTO, SESs, and now it says that it has step counting now, and heart rate detection,
and this vibration, so maybe it's something to think about, think about now, but it's a little big,
but the picture looks pretty interesting, and if you go to the store,
it's $24, and it's scheduled to be back in stock in June 21, 2021, so maybe, maybe,
maybe when the, when the Ex only bites the dust, I can, I can get that, it has a step counter,
and I'm not sure how we would, I would do that, but yeah, I think I would probably feel better
than having a, having that thing, keep track of everything, then having, Ex only have something on
my iPhone that has the history of my steps, so probably there, and the, the, let's see, so let's
check out the pine phone real quick, so the, the pine phone now, it come, it still look wide
core sock, it's still the Mali 400, so that's, so all winner, Mali 400, that's, that's, that's standard
business these days, lots of devices are using that, it comes in two or three, I couldn't recommend
the three more, so go ahead and get the three, I couldn't recommend the 32 more, get the 32, so,
there's a YouTube video, and the, the guy, I haven't watched it, he had, has one, and he has one, so the,
the camera, the, it's just a, it's just a basic everyday little, little phone, and
that so many OSs, so, so I'm pretty sure that instead of a, a new computer, that if they get
that keyboard battery thing, and I will get the pine phone, and the, and the premium configuration,
now if you go to the, the pine book pro, so let's check that out, so they're,
building this now as a, a Chromebook replacement, and I've had a Chromebook, it's, it's okay,
I did the hacks on it and everything, but it's, I'm not sure if this really is gonna be,
you know, the power thing, I mean the one nice thing about it is that it's USB-C, so I don't have
to mess around, that it works with my, same laptop charger that does my work, can charge that,
and my biggest question was, well, it would be the purpose of that, of that, because we have a
nook with a boom two, the pay the bills, and the wife uses the boom, they have boom two nook
pay the bills, and, and, and do all of our, you know, local stuff, so in my life, I'm not sure
what that pine book pro would, would do, it would probably be like my original pine book, and
send it under the TV, and every once in a while I would touch it, so that, that's probably not
gonna happen, and the third item, we already talked about the prime time, and the prime tab,
now this was, this was pretty interesting for me until Amazon went on sale with that 10-inch
candle, the, so, so it's got two, exactly the same memory, exactly the same memory, and
it's got a 64-bit MCE, so the same storage, so it has exactly everything, and it looks like it
comes with a keyboard, it casts these expansion boards for, it's for LTE, LORA, I'm not sure what
that is, and SATA, and RST, so this is probably the most interesting thing, and let's see that,
the, it doesn't have a weight, it doesn't have a weight for it, I've pressed the keyboard,
let's see, does it have a weight, so yes, yes, so it's, it's only 75 grams higher than the,
the gene, with the keyboard, so it's plastic black, IPS touch, and it, it comes with UV boards,
so that's, ah, that, I mean that, that's really compelling, especially with that, the keyboard
that's got a touchpad on it, I don't know, I think you could probably get a pen with that thing,
ah, and if that is, that is pretty interesting, ah, for sure, and, ah, the, the cluster board,
the cluster board, it's, it's, it's basically, if you're doing some edge stuff,
it's, it's, basically if you're doing some edge stuff, let's, let's have a look at the cluster board
real quick, ah, so, ah, it's a gateway to the world of clusters, and a tidy, compact package,
so if you're interested in learning about clusters, probably the, the, this is a good thing,
so it takes the, the, the, so pine models, which is, ah, all in one sock thing,
and you put it into like, it looks like a memory slot, and it has a normal power supply thing,
so you take a PC power supply, and then you have the cluster in there, and it looks like it has
some kind of battery back up, ah, for real-time clock support, so yeah, and, but those are normal
batteries, those aren't like the expensive ones, ah, and, ah, it has a, ah, 15-ounce power supply,
ah, and it, it comes with a barrel, a barrel jack, but it, it looks like, so, a 15, a 5-volt,
15-ounce power supply, with 6.3-millimeter barrel type jack, okay, but it, right beside that,
it looks like it has a normal ATX, ah, power supply header, so you can either do the, the, the barrel,
or you can do the, the, the power supply, so with the ATX power supply, that would really mean that,
that, that you could have, ah, you could put it in an, an old computer case, so that,
that makes it even, even more interesting, and it's got a gigabit, even it, so yeah,
you could, you could put that old computer case, and just, could, can't, the, the gigabit,
even that port, and everything would be, hunky-dory with that, so you could have your entire,
like, raspberry, that whole raspberry farm that I have down there, and see, it has,
one, two, three, four, five, six, that, so it has seven slots in it, and you can, you can
make that into that whole raspberry pie, pine 64, old droid,
thing that I have going on downstairs, it's a little, many data center, that I have down there.
Okay, so let's go keep going, and, ah, the pine tab, we did that, the clusterboard,
the, the pine cell, so the, the pine cell is a, a risk v product, a risk v soldering iron,
running open firmware, so it's a, a pine cell is a smart, many portable soldering iron,
with a 32-bit, risk v sock feature in it, so that, just that it has risk v, that, that could
mean that I could buy it, I don't ever solder, I don't do the fan, but, then it has a risk v
in there, the bum will be cool, oh my god, that's fantastic. And it heats up in 12 seconds,
and can be paired, it's just related with the power horsepower, such as a pine power,
I don't even know what a pine power is, and, but it's really cool, and it's a risk v, so if you
want to have a risk v device, that's probably going to be your cheapest option to have a risk v
though I see days, and the last item is the, the pine cube, and so let's talk about the pine cube,
so, uh, so the pine cube is an open source IV, you can't, it can't under your control,
that's what they're saying, and it's a small, low-powered, open source IP camera,
whether you're looking for baby floss camera, a privacy-oriented shopkeeper, or a homeowner
looking for privacy camera, that, or perhaps a tinker or needing a camera for your drone,
the cubic can be device for you, so it's 5 megapixels, so that's nothing,
that, that, that, that's pretty limiting, right, just right there, then it's 5 megapixel,
um, but it has only vision, and it has IR LEDs for night vision, so it, it's a day or night,
so that's, that's pretty cool, and it keeps its power over ethernet, it has a microphone,
and it, uh, uh, uh, the use cases for this camera are limitless, so it has a microphone,
so I, I would want to know it, so it has Bluetooth, so maybe you could get a speaker to it,
it has a GPO header, uh, so what, you know, it's always really cool about cameras,
it has a microphone, that means you can hear what people say, if you could play something
that they say, play, if they could play your voice while you talk to them over the camera,
that would be pretty cool, but they're right, it's an incredible thing, and, and, uh, so,
interestingly, uh, the pine 64 people don't seem to be pushing so much there,
they're, uh, they're, they're, they're, they're boards anymore, uh, they're, they're,
they're boards, so if you go to the pine, pine store, um, uh, trying to find their
board on their main side is, uh, uh, uh, pretty interesting, so as you click the store,
uh, partner projects, pine podcast, oh, there's a pine podcast, uh, so devices,
um, computer modules, so you have to go inside the thing and click computer modules,
and, um, and computer modules, uh, so they have, so these are the things that they have,
the soap on, they have, uh, the sew edge, the sew edge, so the, so, let's see what the
soap on is, so the soap on is, like I said, that memory thing, so, again, it's a quad core,
um, quad core sock with a Maui 200, so the, the thing is, I think the phone, if they ever
upgrade that, all you have to do is swap that out in the phone, uh, so that's what the soap
pine is, and then, uh, um, you go back and you grab my god, uh, you click on the store thing again,
and so the, the, the devices, and you have pine boards, uh, where the hell is that thing,
uh, and compute modules, and the baseboards, so the baseboards are, are sort of like what I
have, and, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, no, no, it's not, it also takes the module, that's, it just has
everything that, uh, that what I had before with the rock chip thing, it, it just takes that
memory module, so, again, that seems to be very, uh, upgradable, and, uh, uh, go back to the,
store, uh, and click devices, and, uh, click, uh, computer modules, uh, I think the old boards
are under IoT, so if you click IoT, the pine nut, what is the pine nut?
So the pine nut OS is a, is an attempt, pine nut is an open-source attempt for YFO and BFO
module for pine 64 devices, so I know that, that means there's just so much going on on this
pine project. Uh, I'm not sure if you can still buy a pine, uh, well, actually they have a picture
of a pine board, uh, a pine board, uh, and, uh, where it says, what will you make? And, uh, the,
if you click the picture, it doesn't do anything, it doesn't do anything, but they still have,
they still make the boards, so that, that's answered. All right, guys, hey, so it's 22 minutes,
which is sort of along with me and I've been ran one, so, um, anyway, if you get a chance to
support something, uh, the, the, uh, uh, pine six people are last thing, last thing, so they change
their vision. So their goal is to push the envelope and deliver arm and wrist feed devices,
so they added wrist feed, uh, so that if you want to use and develop, uh, for, to this end,
we actively work with the development community and champion end user initiatives rather than
applying, uh, business to floss setting, wheel off floss principles to guide our business. Uh, and,
um, the, uh, they have everything, Twitter, Macedon, Telegram, Blog, Muse, and all the thing.
All right, so please have a look at the pine 64. I can't hold, I can hold heartily endorse these
guys, uh, you know, they were doing things, uh, for open source hardware, uh, Linux phones,
you know, before that when nobody else thought it was possible, they were delivering, you know,
$150 phone that runs Linux. So what more can you say? Now they have a tablet, same thing, uh,
and a Chromebook thing, and it goes on and on and on. All right, hey, take care, y'all, be safe, bye.
