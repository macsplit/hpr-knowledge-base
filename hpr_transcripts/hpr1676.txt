It is now the HPR New Year show part three. This is the HPR Community News.
It is now 18-100 UTC and we have just welcomed in the time zones of Bangladesh, Russia and
for more. Happy New Year everybody.
The community news if you don't know already is a show that we put on once a month to give you
the ins and outs of what's been going on in the HPR Community News in the HPR Community and if
you've been listening to this you probably have a better handle on what's going on the most.
I'll paste the show notes into the link to the show notes and so you can all follow along.
Yeah, can you paste an oncast planet or PM it to me Ken Fallon because I'm on my phone right now?
It's on allcast planet and if you go to the HPR site it's episode 16-7-6-16-7-6.
Okay, folks. So the whole point community news as I said is to just give a bit of a rundown of what's
been happening in the HPR Community and we usually start this with welcoming new hosts. This month's
hosts are Real and Michael whose second name I will not be pronouncing because we thought
when we get a cheap laugh I'd be butchering it. So it started off with the HPR Community News for
November 2014 and the following day we had GeekSpeak which was showcasing the central closed public
broadcast radio show splash podcast GeekSpeak. I think there's one of yours.
You need to watch and the and the reasons of all that I spent in my preamble and the show notes
they all when they started out they weren't giving any thought to creative commons and they always
I guess since they're radio station they can get away with it they played you know a part a part
of DeVos through being cool as their as their start music and then oh a couple of years ago
many more they started you thought towards going creative commons and so they submitted for
unique creative commons submissions occasionally they would play they would play that instead but
you know I I listened to the first part in the end part of months of you know I had to go
clear all the way back to June of last year before I found one that didn't have it didn't have
DeVos either at the starter the end now they did correspond with me and I guess at least we've had
the effect of that you know they're set up making them realize that they got DeVos all the time
even though they want to be creative commons and so they said well we're not going to do DeVos
to be getting anymore so guess we could say we've had a positive effect on that show that
that was one of the first podcasts I started listening to and it's great for just general
technology news and they're not a Linux podcast but they are certainly Linux aware
now as a great addition is it's nice to get these little shows and there you're doing
I think a boiler place templates for what you should do for syndication of shows as we don't
syndicate shows on HPR there is a site called hacker media which is the sister
in a project I think and their shows can be syndicated but this is a perfect example of you
know taking a good show that you like wrapping it up and here's why I like it here's the sample
episode and off with you brilliant I'm good show notes as well thank you I think you're
beginning to understand how how paranoid I am about show notes well always seems to be mine
because you're a problem no no lack of show notes is is the folks I've been I've been freaking
everybody out about whether we're going to have people to do the show notes or not
for this episode and the e2pad thing is is brilliant actually it's a really really lot that's
a collaboration collaboration tool it makes it really easy just to be able to copy and paste out
the the links in there so thanks today though it is already done the show notes for this section
of the show so we can just refer e2pad to those I don't know no sorry hello there I'm
don't you stay here just so just to say I'm here I see his name three times and he appears
I'm not saying I'm not saying it's all the evidence I need to stone him stone him how are you
keeping Dave I'm good thank you happy new year everybody yes we had on 1653 that was the third
howca's in was Rucho's interview or at the I think it was a talk at the Ohio Linux Fest and
about hardware needing to be open as well I really liked this this interview or this talk actually
and again another good example of taking an episode or a creative commons event
and wrapping it up and putting it on here is a sample and it is still permissible I mean
I'm not saying we should do it when we've got plenty of shows in the queue and I'm not sure how
to find what's plenty but it is still permissible to grab a talk off say archive.org and wrap it
up and put it on as a show isn't it well anything's permissible but you kind of want to make it
into a show yourself if if it's something that you found an archive that org that is interesting
and cool and will be of interest hackers and absolutely do that but if we're just day after day
going out to archive.org and putting stuff on HPR just to keep HPR going on the back of
somebody else's project then I don't see a lot of point you know set up an RSS feed and feed
it into hacker media and let everybody just get it from an aggregator then we become a planet you know
and there's no we're not creating new content the whole point of this is create new content
and I do want to congratulate the HPR community or commend them for stepping up it's probably a good
thing my computer was dead for two or three days because of fan problem because I was going to
I was going to dump like three more in a row in there so good on the hacker public radio community
I second that completely I if you ready myself to rock was I've already had this heart attack
moment several times and every single time the community does step up usually you know who you
are who step up actually it's very easy to find out who you are basically the people who
contributed this month so yeah well done those people earn a very special place in your heart
wouldn't you agree 50 anyway the following day we had 1654 which was using ASN numbers to
uniquely identify each network on the internet I don't know if anyone found this interesting but
I have been struggling with this problem for a long time and this was a pretty elegant solution
oh yeah I really enjoyed oh did you ever show notes attached to it I want to look
I know sorry to put you on the spot that's one of those I'd either have to listen to it again
and take notes or hope I could find the resource somewhere but yeah that's I found that fascinating
not only you could do it but you'd actually you'd actually come up with a real world
use for it yeah I do have the I have of the show notes ready but with this month being
kind of busy on the HPR front we guess not only the community news but the other stuff that
I've been doing I haven't had a chance to cross post it and put it in here but that those
show notes will be coming and after me giving you all the stick about not having show notes
we go to my episode and it doesn't have any show notes okay I'm gonna pop myself in the corner
after the show but it is you you before I had that script you you want to see what an ugly
hacks I had trying to get this thing achieved and now it's just a simply simple bash case statement
it's really you know sometimes you have those those little moments where your life suddenly
is a lot has been made a lot better to these computers I think nightwise often talks about
past you know getting computer technology working for you and that was the case where it worked for me
okay moving on 1655 LibreOff was called creating pivot tables does anyone ever use pivot tables
well I might be able to now I will tell you a story because nobody else is talking
on anyone else there was a time when we were I was working for a company and we were trying to
convert people to using a standardized desktop which was Microsoft Office at the time and the
amount of friction that we got from people you would not believe it I know in this world where
people think Microsoft rule the world that was not the case we had to give training courses after
training courses to get people off Lotus 123 or other spreadsheet packages and I remember being
there was one diehard accountant person who would not move over and we had her in the training
course and she simply would not get on board with the program and then I showed her pivot tables
and that was it from that moment on she switched and the whole accounting team came over and
life was was a lot more bearable after that they are very powerful if you happen to use them
download this episode oh and I want to interject from hash off cast planet uh k-wisher just posted
that he got email back from john newsteader and now we have 40 connections so give it you do
can you uh can somebody who's on this please paste in the names at the very bottom of the episodes
put in a thank you page and add these people to k5 talks as well and Kevin yourself as well please
so that we can have a list of people to thank at the end yeah and uh Jonathan
uh called from uh a ananastoz.com as well or somebody remind me to do that after the show
then we had my audio player collection which is from Dave Morris who has far too many
audible players and this is part one if was this part one or was this the the full total of your
audio players Dave no this was it this was it i'm not doing anymore i've already driven everybody mad
with this list it just goes to show what happens when you retire and you haven't got you haven't
got enough to do Dave you will always have enough to do just take up the email and send me an email
and i will make sure you're busy for the rest of your natural idea what i said
now brilliant it was also nice because i had quite a lot of those myself and it prompted me to dig
out my first mp3 player which i'm holding here and it was an mp3 player because that's all
the plate and for some reason the back him off and i was keeping the battery in with cello tape
and now the whole thing is like going up the cello tape has come off and all the sort of stand
is stuck to it so yeah i might do an absolute mess sometimes but good show Dave good ideas thank you
people have other case that they like to tell us about that is something excellent and awesome
that they should do your first computer your first you know device that you carried around that
you really found a little bit the following day we had john culp from Louisiana if i'm not mistaken
is that correct seem to associate him with that okay hacking gluttenberg ebooks i love the show
i love the show because it's it's got technology that's outside of copyright and he's going in there
and doing exactly that there's one thing that's annoying him and he's going in and he's fixing it
and you can do that because you've got access to the to the books brilliant brilliant brilliant
well this is a whole example of using open software to scratch your own itch because
i mean you know i wouldn't spend that much time on on formatting a book but i i'm so glad that he
can do it yeah exactly but you know 50 you've had that thing where it's just annoying you
it every time you look at it it's annoying maybe it's just me yeah possibly it's just me but it's
really really cool to be able to go in and make that change and the the like go back to the script
that i have every time i used to run us i knew it was a luge even though it worked i still knew
it was a luge now i run it and i think it's exactly the same outcome but it feels nice and
comfy i don't know it's a small cup no that's why we're hackers will spend three hours on on
tweaking something that has absolutely nothing to do with our productivity and we could just
just easily ignore absolutely yeah it's that xkcd comic i'll try and remind myself to put a link
to that one in the show the following day we had cool stuff part two c prompt talks about more
cool stuff that he discovered one of which was the today i found out podcast to anyone start
listening to that Dave i can't believe that wasn't in your list no no sorry and we had
david was those of that podcast and website came onto the comments and said thanks for mentioning
the show which is kind of cool and command line tips control left right that's that was also
very excellent and xd2 which was something i didn't know about in xfce very nice the only thing
again i would say is why he not split up into three episodes but that's just me now i really enjoyed
that one as well the following day we had john archer with a core nominal who as rapidly putting
all of us who do interviews to shame with the professionalism that he has of the putting in
editing at the beginning and the the beeps and the interview and the beepouts so very very good show
um with john archer i understand as well that they're starting going to start a new podcast
was he involved in the linux podcast or did i get that wrong it's been a while since i listen
an episode but yeah i think there was something about that in there i think they pulled circle one
of our sister well one of our i would say yes sister podcast at least definitely in our
hpr family um they are stopping with the full circle podcast and they're starting a podcast called
the linux podcast and i believe they're having somebody from the um uk fedora team i think it could
be john but we'll see but it was a nice interview is nice to get in some more of these odd
yeah thank you yes you're audible i hate you and you get to keep the book after you hit me
okay the following day which was uh the 12th of the 12th which was my birthday um trying out
slackware hpr 1660 slackware newbie benny is taking a long time he's talking to a long time
slackware user macnalu and this is a nice sort of chassis episode and basically all about slackware
so opans whose first distro was slackware in the day gosh that's a lot of hands well done
yeah i haven't been playing with linux long enough for for for me to come in when it was the only
distribution it was my it was my first one on the same machine that we were testing out windows 95
believe it or not uh we also were trying out slackware uh in mark so there you go and the reason was
is the bolt had a DVD not to start another debate the point you know i i just don't understand
the dichotomy really was slackware because you can install it have it not install those parts of
the kernel that uh for hardware you don't have uh so you know you can make it very slim on memory
but you know as a default you would you install every single package that you could ever possibly
install at the beginning so you have you have the huge hard hard drive footprint
yeah but didn't have to you could that's why the easy packages you could load cd or the floppy disk
be or the floppy disk d so you haven't split up that way it was it was kind of cool efficient
that way as well and of course back in the day i don't think you had the linux modules
everything had to be compiled in your module system wasn't there
okay
hey 51 50 kind of funny you spreading you do a slackware install you can choose individual packages
from the different sections you don't have to install everything
wow you rely and you're done you're done
well well then uh uh i understand that but a lot of what they were talking talking about
less their theory is since it's it's not a problem that uh it's more difficult to install packages
on slackware because you it's you're installing every package that you could ever need during
during installation process so you never have to go back and uh compile and install software
i think that was more to do with the dependencies the
i have heard um tell to you all about that that you install a lot of the dependencies so
anything that would be on those disks you just install it and you don't need the dependencies
because they're already there oh i see so what they're talking about is installing all just about
all the possible libraries but not not actual applications i believe so but i um slackware give
me a lot of gray hair as we said yeah that's it in the nutshell see which can pick up folks if you
listen to an off podcast anyway coronal again 1661 i'll come back to you with Paul Tamsun this
i loved the code club volunteers this is this is um following on from my um interview last week
last month with uh or is it this month actually yeah anyway getting more kids involved
is the way to solve a lot of these um profile issues uh with members of the community and this
is a brilliant way to do it given you know going out volunteering going in uh supporting teachers and
giving a class one one day a week uh to your local school that's that's that's that's genius that's
what that is and the following day we had Linux logcast episode 001 outtakes pre-show and after
show banter and with Kevin wishes i like this it's um i like the i like the Linux logcast
shows for a start because they're quite interesting um but it's it's this was a cool
pre-emotional chat but again during to this sort of 26 hour show then why wouldn't you be
into another outtakes show and there is another one uh uh that we're gonna we're gonna get to
yeah so there's some of the things we're in that first show that if i'd known it was going to be
is going to be used i might have used a slightly different phrasing but that's okay i can't
imagine anybody's ever going to listen to it that would uh get me into trouble but i'm going to
take you know feel free to have at me since i'm the uh i think the only member of Linux logcast
uh or well everybody's a member of Linux logcast because everybody is welcome to come but
uh they'll be the only regular member here in the room so uh you know feel free to take shots at me
on the on those podcast but i i will i remember watching irc when that came out and i wasn't sure
what was going on but some but and i think it applies more to my shows last month but uh
uh somebody was saying well we ought to do this every time uh hpr gets uh low on shows is
is is just load up fifty one fifty on beer and let them sit there and talk
yeah but yes i'm i actually i'm completely in the agreement with that especially when you do
the beer reviews 50 so you keep doing that my friend
they following day i don't know if it was the following day but the next sequence is hpr 1663
which was uh interview with Greg uh greenley founder of blacks and technology and as i said in the
show basically um you know there's a bit of a was a bit of a stomp about uh odd camp and did it
basically uh reflect society and the answer of course is no uh whether reflected the state of
the technology um world the actors probably yes more so than more so than the most i would say
but it just does highlight that we have a bug here um we have a bug here in relation to
um the the type of hackers that we're getting in that's not to say we're excluding
these hackers at all we need to grow the community because there are hackers out there everywhere
it's just they probably don't know their hackers yet so we need to grab them and pull them in
not because they're black not because they're white not because they're uh i don't know
Asians not because whatever um because they're hackers so yeah that's uh and i i would like uh
i'll send out a few more feeders to other people to see if they would like to come on and just
discuss this topic i don't want it to be a uh you know we're discuss we're talking to this person
minority group because they're up in to be a minority group um both i do want to make sure that we
are uh pulling people in and that uh we're making everybody feel as welcome as possible
on worse getting as many hackers as possible in the world well i mean uh just microcosm for that i
mean yeah uh it was questions in the mailing list whether we should you know
be saying well make uh make uh make uh like distinctions but you know clearly with lack and i
think the lack of participation uh by everyone except uh you know white European descent mails it
you know is actually worse in in the free software area than it is in technology in general so
clearly you know i uh i i i think somebody making an effort especially especially if we could go
if it would be possible to go in places and and uh uh teach people the young age to come over
technology you know that uh uh i i don't the culture tends to exclude from technology because
clearly the culture does i don't think that the culture excludes necessarily i think it's more the
fact that there's not as many uh anti-social minority people that's the other kind of worms in the
but i i think to just to answer the the thing on the mailing list is you know it's about a point
to why are we segregating off blacks and technology and why are they doing their own thing
yet at the same time you know if you think of it from the point of view of
boss you know the Ubuntu UK podcasts are doing that they're having to show just about a Ubuntu so
that you know it's just another way we're at the same community they're just supporting
their community uh in the same way that the Ubuntu community is supporting Ubuntu users it's just
a different way of looking at the patient it was really glad to hear from Greg that he he does
consider himself uh part of the general community in fact the his reason for doing it his reason
for getting involved was his participation at the Ohio Linux Fest which again is a great legacy
for the Ohio Linux Fest so regardless uh it's uh it's something that we need to keep an eye on
and uh i think we need to move on to the next show if that's okay with everyone and that was
1664 life and times of a geek part one Dave Dave Dave Dave you are prompted me to uh
there are so many shows i want you to do as a result of this for a start how to use the slide rule
yes you definitely need to do that yes yes i've i've agreed that i'll have a go though uh as i said
in the in the comments my old mathematics teacher would probably have a fit if he heard me trying
to explain this because uh i was not a good student in those days but i'll have a shot
they're correct me from long they were we always had to use log tables but if you had a slide rule
you could work it out yeah it's a logarithmic scale you just uh you just align numbers according to
uh you know you put the if you're multiplying two numbers you put one on the bottom and the other
one above it and and because they're logarithmic scales you can read off the uh the um the answer
on the on the slide rule i you see i can't really do it because i've forgotten and i haven't
going in front of me tell you what we'll do tell you what you need to do right is uh i remember on
deal extreme or somewhere like that one of the uh chinese uh you know deal our uh cheap websites
they had uh slide rules that you could buy for real cheap but they take about a month or two to get
there so if we can find out one of those put it in the mailing list then everybody can order
them and then once everybody's got the slide rules you can do the show how about that
yes yes right everybody let's multiply three by three and this is how yes i can see it now
i would personally love that as well yeah that there are some good resources out on the way
but i did notice that so i'll probably be pointing at those once i get around to doing the show
but uh yeah it's it's cool it's cool stuff but even aside from that you you did prompt me to um
reconsider looking us uh how i got into the mix as well uh how it got into tech one
you're uh yeah love these shows keep them coming folks keep them coming
well i always love these origin shows and especially if somebody who's an original geek like Dave
yeah they don't come much older than me yeah but it's it's uh you put the origin shows like that one
you put your finger on it like everybody in all of the shows that's been done every single person
has had a like a different story and it's just amazing the interesting
this was the reason that i did this because i i don't think i would have wanted to do this if i
hadn't had other people doing fast what i found to be fascinating shows about their origins um
so yeah so thanks to everybody else for prompting me to to do it really yeah i think i'll
rename this series origin uh episode and you can remember to come back and do that once i uh
listen to the show and i figured that it must exist Dave doesn't have any excuse for not doing
the show right away because i just i just posted an all cast planet a a uh slide rule simulator page
well cool oh no there's no way out folks you uh you won't hear this because of the trunkade
silence but for the next 10 minutes it's been silent can i sit in the back of this classroom with
the other cool kids you you someday you'll be stranded on a desert island needing to know the
exact angle for takeoff right and then you'll be going why did no pay attention with my slide rule
i don't think that's ever going to happen because i don't really leave my house so
close the warming your house becomes an island you'd never see it coming time
anyways uh working with pivot tables uh i can't basically say anymore about that then i already
have said pivot tables are cool if you are not using them you should and uh don't forget that there
are um examples in the show notes and detailed um detailed links and summaries in all of who
shows so very very good keep up the good work bare metal programming from the rarest repire part three
whoo no fluff episode here i'll tell you nothing uh this uh uh you know the the intro and outro thing
where we go the episodes for text-to-speech that's uh i think all our visual impaired listeners hate
um i love it because if i was listening to this if i was on the train in the morning and listening
to this i would have a brain seizure it's this show had to be listened at the particular correct
time that your brain is capable of taking it in oh yeah oh yeah i got a hand at the game or even
fire i mean uh just it wouldn't occur to me uh oh what let's get a raspberry pie and as a learning
experiment uh let's start and build our own operating system for it it's just amazing the the
level this guy is operating on it's just yeah i'm shocked i'm shocked by you know the quality of
stuff everybody in this network brings and i'm embarrassed by times of what i put up
look at me written a basket yeah and uh who's got real writing arm code and transporting libraries
or it's amazing awesome awesome awesome stuff folks and the following day first time holes
real how to start your own blog and we've had this up on the uh requested topics and i think the
approach here was you know why you would start your own blog and i had a really had to chuckle
because on my own blog it's uh i have per lesio people that my blog target audience is so that
i won't forget stuff um so my target audience is already met a hundred percent when i read it
myself so but it was a very nice um philosophical look at why you might want to start a blog so a good
read platoon made a welcome return with uh talks about the nicks installer packaging applications
for the new linux and the bsd's we also didn't even know this was possible and i need to put this
into the packaging series um that he has done he's done some in the past and rpms and uh
devs and that sort of thing um this is this is excellent oh yeah i can't imagine this and
hats off to the to the uh coders who who built this system at you know a distro agnostic
packaging system and especially when it knows what it it knows what distro it's going on and put
stuff in the in the appropriate folders and and solves dependencies and etc i mean just hats
off to this and and you know it seems seems like well why would we need to to mess with any other
package manager well i think it was more supporting the package manager is just a way of
distribution but what i really liked about this was that it could the integration with the package
it could integrate with the existing package manager so that's when you did uh a yum
erase or a apt aptitude removed or whatever that it would know that those files are there and you
could remove it that way which is which is a stoker genius you know oh yeah i forgot to mention that
that that is the best part of it brilliant and you know i suppose what as platoon says he was doing a
hack by uh running his own scripts and you know doing a sort of bootstrap but hey you know you
could you could send down a simple app like that and then have a pull uh stuff from your own
website or whatever so yeah it's pretty uh pretty cool i like this
miss your new live bill new retro computing and uh another person who's operating i must say
as a higher level than myself um although i do would like him to do some more um introduction to
electronics things this is a very very interesting topic it's a like a little basic computer
pretty cool yes another one of those things that never would occur to me to do i mean it sounds
fascinating but uh you know i i want to get a really working computer out of it i mean maybe
you could do a retro apple 2 or something like that but yeah hats off it with this this is just
something that i can't imagine doing myself but i'm glad bill is here to tell us about it
some of my first computers were uh were basic computers and just dropped you to a prompt like that
and then okay what next 10 print hello go to 10
yep pretty cool anyways have a follow-on date ahuka privacy and security digital signatures and
certificates how how canonical got all that's money and good he is laying the foundation for
very very good security and the privacy um series so much so that the security community are now
beginning to refer to hbr as a location for getting security podcasts so well done uh hookah
yeah i didn't realize that that's great not yeah i i so much enjoy this series as well
yeah i follow the uh i get notified of the twitter feeds if you follow as hbr we've been uh
in the last week or so we've been getting um uh things about security podcasts that you should
listen to hbr for those shows which is pretty very good Linux lookcast episode two outtakes i think we
already uh already discussed this one that's okay yeah i think we talk about there's a whole
no problem uh japan next one Roger and then we have um Steve with system d for learner drivers how
to drive system d without crashing the vehicle through arguing with your passengers my more main
argument against system d was exactly this that they were wasn't and again with pulsodio i think a
lot of the confusion comes from the fact that people don't know what's going on and they feel
there's no documentation there they don't know how to get to the documentation and it's all very
well to say there's a man page but this i think had done more for my understanding of system d
than anything else now i'm looking at some of the tools that he's mentioned oh that's a lot
better than than what we had before oh this is a lot better than what we had before and uh
then you go oh this is this the whole approach now after doing this seems very um much like what
son solaris have done with their work or IBM or aix and you think okay well this is
system d might be trying to make Linux a little bit more professional perhaps so
well well i think i think a lot better but go ahead again no and i was finished i was just
telling you to go ahead okay uh i don't know i i think a lot of the init versus system d debate is
just because you know for for people who are already init hackers and know what to uh how to get
down in that system and do something with it it's just oh we gotta learn all this all over again
i think it's a lot of the resistance and then probably your average Linux user who
who doesn't get that that deep into their system it's probably transparent to them
yeah but a lot of sys admins who work on various different unique systems would know that
um on other platforms this exists you know and it's not it's not random from one
distribution to the other to the whatever i'm not i'm not arguing for it or against us yeah
don't get me wrong here and i would prefer if if in a way you know you're going away from the
BSD's not using this but in another way you're harmonizing the Linux distribution so all
Linux distributions are now operating like this because before you had Debbie and do in her own way
um fedora doing is another way you know and
and yeah now if everybody uses the system d well system d is the way the way the Linux does it
but it still feels like system d is fragmented that says maybe but at least here my point here
with this episode was okay now somebody has explained what's going on and then we can
make an informed argument as to whether it you know it makes sense or not so cascading things
seems a bit overdone to me but but this is a good a good kickoff point you know what I mean
talking about the episode not they it's not they system d now per se yeah it was a great episode
i really enjoyed it and i think he did manage to avoid you know okay here system d we
whatever you say about this is how it works i'm not saying the world where the other so yeah
brilliant it loves you something else that is normally available on Linux is the zfs
file system and this was also from first time hawk michael to ransky nope nope can i answer that right
anyone want to have a go i would say seeransky i would be more than happy to accept that
can i put my two pennathan i have two two Polish guys living next door and i took this name across
them and said how would you say that and they said it's chera zinsky there you go above and be hot
well i just saw them in the driveway and said this is so typical of you Dave i do a script and you
come along and replace my 20 lines with a one liner in perl thank you very much slap me in the face
again i don't just just because i have Polish neighbors you know it's nothing to do with me
no brilliant okay thank you very much anyway great episode and also refers to another good episode
about jwp and that was it for the month as far as episodes go all in all 15 not bad considering we
were starving for shows at the beginning of the month eh yeah they had the i was sweating both a
little bit too i bet you are i bet you are that has been my life for the last couple of
some of the years four years now it's been four years on hpr has been going for seven years
so yeah i've been posting them for about four years okay holy crap congrats there can
wow thank you very much okay Dave do the comments and you're in your living and there better be
a good humorous story with every single one of these yeah what what no ken old defer to you you're
better at this than i am let me see let me see let me see how to start a blog what do we start
well we normally start from the from the bottom i think don't we because it's
the way we've ordered this we agreed on doing it this way but i always find a little bit puzzling
to be honest with you it's ordered this way because that's the order that you'll see the comments in
the in the if you follow the the p link in from the home page yeah okay
oh i don't know what to do
yeah okay we had mans mans son asking about tidily wiki if this is on to john pulps adopting and
renovating a textbook i don't know why what the point of tidily wiki would be except textbooks
as i'm searching for tidily wiki here next place the versatile notebook application you can download
for free is this a is this an advertisement did you let us spam in mans are you spamming us
i couldn't make i let this one through so it's my fault but i couldn't make up my mind it looked
like a genuine comment but no no i'm part of tidily wiki i think they've used used it in the day
so we had a bare metal programming part two with even more comments of course from mike ray saying
brilliant um i bring you into the episode and uh oh no there's Allison um it will be
great basis for a hackfest and i couldn't agree more yes a comment on one of your episodes uh if you
want 50 um by gigasphere basically saying um that community is a meta people and that's um yeah it's
great episode uh good to listen to and make sure you remember that it's the people that makes the
difference well thank you for those kind words gigaspiracy i i'm only saying part of these uh my
my comment on the uh on what you link you gave me just ends in great episode yeah you need to
click on the link or you need to click on the p in hacker public radio and then you will see that
so for example there's also a comment on the unison syncing utility by bort i5250 thanks for the
podcast to use some one thing i would like to add is that both me and both back ends need to be
the exact same version when i tried getting it working between two we run two machines with
different versions it wouldn't talk to each other so it took it ages to figure out what was wrong
also when we were talking about this last month i think i was saying i was having trouble with it
in work and then i realized that there are different versions of unison that you can install
and it's only in later versions that has this sync book so if you go back and install a previous
version of one that's something or two that's something definitely not the two that four version
it doesn't have this unicode panic issue that i'm seeing so it's a case of uh Linux
ludite deciding we like the old stuff better on this okay great it was a bolt tank
thanks for for that because that uh that was more detail or more or more research that i went into
and seeing it sounds like unfortunately you came up on some of that stuff by accident but uh
uh good on you for uh you know coming up with a solution and posting same
yeah and um there was a lot of comments on your bash parameter manipulation
David um starting with our uh comment by um see we went down as far as john
at this month it started by um john culp yes whole new category of cool bash tricks i think
john had a few bash scripts himself if i recall
oh john's no slouch when it comes to to bash so uh it's very kind of him to uh to uh make
complimentary comments he's he's a pretty cool guy himself and they had uh there was a comment
by music piece um uh they're talking about magnum tunes as well
you replied to that can you just give us the summer yeah yeah he he was saying thanks for the
show and also thanks for the pointer to magnum tune which he apparently hadn't come come across
which is surprising but but magnum tune is not free but uh but it's uh it's an excellent
source of music and it's run by john buckman who does an amazing job and really he's run
these people who he's running a label a music label here but he's he's paying great attention
to the artists which is pretty unusual for music labels in my understanding so uh he's uh
he's a person to be admired i believe you know i think i remember uh hearing an interview with him
on the links in tech show but it's a long time ago now so it might be might be time for somebody to
give him a call and see what they're doing and how they're good enough they do promote creative
commons works those uh unless they change that yeah i think so yes but but they do it is creative
commons works yes i think you're right yeah
sorry the next one raspberry pie accessibility and this was uh mic ray who just to recall
he fixed a bug on the um with pie speak up and uh we had a comment by gigosphere same
thanks mic great episode and great to help great to hear these types of uh episodes and he had
this issue with e-speak and he completely agrees with the accessibility accessibility terminals
hey everybody it's buddy omuranda how are you?
i told you all i told you all the bull how are you?
doing okay uh trying to figure out how to plumble i should have talked to 51 first
yeah where is that in the middle of you usually should be rocked up in the list and you're um
yeah i know i'm getting out of your arms uh if anything i guess i'll try and call in a little bit later
just give us 10 minutes i think yeah just give us 10 minutes i think yeah
speaking of time zones uh did we miss one?
i think we've got three minutes to the next thing
whoa oh god my ears
yeah okay that's uh yeah i think that's something arises that
okay uh comment on the the
the
interviewer community news of last month the reason all these comments seems so new to me is
because somebody has taken over my job of approving the comments mr. morris and now i'm reading them
ah when you're trying to help that Ken you know that's worse this month
51 snoring or Ken Fallon saying thank you very much mr. mic great
okay
well it wasn't just by storing in fact it was mainly taken at your store because he was keeping me awake
that's that's what's the boundaries of that episode i really do have to say
i mean all the crashing and thrashing that you hear in there that that's that's me awake rolling
over from side to side trying to go back to sleep
yeah and Dave um those also commented there Dave you kind of people then the indiegogo projects
deleting digital divide one computer at a time um is that over yeah it's uh it's over
thank you it is actually yeah and then we had a lot of comments also about mic raise
on my audio player collection by Dave morris and mic ray who thoughtfully had the Dave morris
national audio player museum commenting about uh you know error getting an error so Ken might actually
work um pee commenters that you never try the irriver clicks too why Dave why
so many so many hours in the day it's actually quite hard to get hold of them now i've been
hunting debate for the film um they don't seem to be about maybe they're not very popular maybe
they're not then people don't like them as much as pee does anyway i shall try i'll find one i'll let
you know okay and you uh replied to both of them as well so um and pee then replied to you
basically goes into uh both of you going to the discussion about that if you want to read more
there in the comments with available as an rss feed uh Ken is on the side would it be i don't know
would it be would it be possible to email the uh host i mean automate emailing the host when
when one of their shows has been commented on i you know i obviously had a couple on there
of comments that i didn't personally get back back to just because uh i don't uh i'm not
happy to go back and looking for comments where i should probably should be it is something we could
consider something we've we've spoken about before it's not Ken at least i have yeah i i was going
to say i use a um an rss reader since i still use rss for some old and creepy uh then i find that
i seal the alerts to new podcasts in an rss reader quite it's quite successfully but uh that's
just me yeah some people might like the rss and yeah the cause then if we start emailing everybody every
time a comment comes on we'd have to get up in whether they want to do that or not so i don't know
what do you what do you think uh um can we put that on to the it's emailing this discussion i think
50 it's a it's a good point technically i think we can do it yeah because you know we're we're
doing emails now for um the show uploads which we get to in a minute um so i think we could do
it technically it really i'd like to hear back from people i'm reluctant to still have to go
around and put another tick box in for people do you want notifications when comments come in
you see that right we'll get that one over to the newsletter
okay so we had uh some other comments cool stuff part two uh about c prompt
and uh davin says uh yeah we already said he uh he put in a link to his uh today i found out
com um which any to add to my reader and we need to send that out as well you need to tell
about the new year in there again okay um no you can do this oh no i i i don't have the thing in front
of me okay so then who else can i guess to do this welcome uh to much of russia uh i don't see no
no okay 1900 i'm sorry greetings to pakistan and tashkit is lahabad Lahore and kerachi
and we missed india shirlanka new deli Mumbai
kola kaupt and bangalore at the half hour so happy new year to you as well
we're sorry we missed so many of you and we missed nipal kathamamdu
brithinatar and kookaar please put me down this misery
you know and in light of of urn luve having a new year's whistle to blow every time since
since pegwalls here well you can get the didgeridune and uh play it every every time uh we
celebrate a new year i didn't have a i could i did have a a text to speech
paying announcing them both then you were all talking over them in the background so i stopped
it was coming in on the hbr streaming boss it was going announced in the mad at particular time
so i just cancelled it i mean this year i didn't realize yeah at the beginning i put them
irsi and in the chat and and they uh and uh you just kept talking over i don't know it sounds
just like somebody's got text to speech on the mumble because it's the same voice it's the
speak voice so you probably notice oh okay that's what i was hearing yeah if we don't get this
if we get the break at the exact right time which i did several times this morning
um but well that's that's a great idea so we don't miss it but uh and i guess it was i was going to
say if it wasn't coming over the uh uh the mumble then anybody recording on mumble uh wouldn't be
able to get it but uh you got to keep going because it was coming in on the mumble um then
everybody on mumble gets it and because it goes out on the mumble boss it's because it's coming
and from the mumble boss they also got it so it's probably more pronounced for the people on
the recordings than as well as for you uh now okay is it the text to speech pronounce things right
can well it pronounced some better than me
and my bill uh left a comment by the way on augham bend review with uh john archer and he just
realized that uh he had met him in person at aug camp uh i saw that going up i've met john as well
twice now there were comments to trying out slackware and uh lumix enjoyed listening to minor
corrections since 14.4 the ISO is a ISO hybrid that can put straight on to a pen drive
migray uh giving in um comments that it's now something from to the pack with uh accessibility
so some work that could be done there and uh bending replied um giving some answers back
if you want to read those in the show notes you're more welcome to do so then we had a few uh comments
on the episode um that i did with uh Greg greenley um basically um referring to the links to the
podcast and directive has he gotten back to you with the correct link yes i posted it as a as a
comment there uh can it's in the second comment after this thing um it's uh it's a spreeker
you spreeker for the that's right uh the podcast so uh it's there he said it was going to put it
on the site uh when he had a moment okay yeah cool and then there was a lot of comments to your
uh life and times of a geek uh from uh ftenny um cool stuff nice start looking forward to more
was it my column also replied says it was a great episode uh looking to the uh slide route tutorial
and you of course reply it back saying that you definitely will be doing the
tutorial in the future no escape me no no very metal programming part three just two more sets of
comments mike where uh migray really liking the show as he showed and then uh gabriel uh replying
back and some answers to the questions that you mentioned and um two reals episode and how to
start a blog um uh saying uh devi jordan likes flat uh press because it doesn't require a database
like uh more prestos i've never heard of that one devi you should really do a um episode on
flat press that would be interesting to hear so that is pretty much it for the comments and for
the um for the rundown on the review so all that's left for us to do is discuss what was going on
on zmailing list and then the community news is pretty much over so let me just dig that out
um so migray has an alternative text to speech s vok dashpego which was available for ubuntu and
i installed it there work beautifully really liked the the sound coming out of it um
haven't had a chance to implement that into the workflows yet because i'm a bit busy with the
getting ready for this show and also um finishing off the new year's resolution for the
what you talk about in a while so if anybody knows how to get that installed onto
fedora really easy that would be nice to have a how-to yes uh i think uh somebody replied
back saying that i can take the package apart and and have a look or you know uh there's a package
of build per arch but i'm gonna see i want one more and then sorry go on i was going to say when you
get that uh working met uh that project put a uh put a link in the mailing list i developed uh
small interest in uh text to speech and you may for may or may not have heard earlier this morning
i was talking to jonathan some i think he agrees with me that the default
voice in uh in in e speak at least in e speak is the easiest one uh to uh to hear because he
he listens to it at so many times advanced and when he tries one of the more natural sounding ones
he he has more uh he says he doesn't can't understand them as well as the uh default voice
please continue but uh but mike and trend we did we did get around the talking about that this morning
okay let's not redo that again but um yeah mike is kind of passionate about the uh migrae is also
blind and he's passionate about using e speak as well because it's very fast so um but they
there are other accessibility uses for text to speech engine which is my use case and that is
where um speed is not of the uh essence but um understanding is and nurturing so the person
listening doesn't go away crying that is that is my goal for text to speech so we shall meet
somewhere in middle i hope then we had a call for emergency shows um and we were uh yeah
put it down to the wire basically you know i put more problems on the website but i will say
said it before and i'll say it again if we don't get shows hpr as a project stopped very very simple
don't have shows it stopped stopped is going to happen someday you know um we've discussed it
and community news is probably a good time to discuss that but we we've already touched upon
that i bet i guess uh 50 and you know we could rehash all episodes but you know i want to go down
i probably want to go down like a inflaming ship if there's no episodes then we just stop it and then
put everything is available in our pocket it's not as if we've lost anything but the only part
the only person who decides whether hfr continues as a project is people listening to it and
they do that by submitting shows we've already had 260 shows this year and just to give you
an idea they're um and then ex-outlaws one of the most prolific podcasts have been running for
was it seven years and they have released 370 shows we have released 260 this year and it's not
you know completely different ballpark but just to give you an idea of the number of shows that
we churn through here every every week and again if you hear people other podcasters uh we've
who've been discussing hfr as an alternative um to you know as linux podcas and especially when
we've had the promo going out for the show and we need to thank everybody who played that and a
lot of them will say they don't listen to the show and that's absolutely fine um that they'll
listen to one or two episodes there this is actually it's very few people who has you know you need
to be a specifically dedicated podcast listener to be able to listen to every one of these shows
coming out in this network so that is it's it's just the volume of stuff that i want to say is
over how i move for a lot of people but we do five shows a day five shows a week so therefore we
need five shows a week coming in to meet them and thanks to everybody who did contribute shows
this month that's all i'll say about that and this might be an interesting point to Mitch i see you
scheduled for show 1700 which counting the 300 episodes of today with a techie will will be the
2000s show for uh for this podcast network i don't know if we have any idea what we want to do or not
or for if this is the time to to discuss it but i didn't want to throw out there somebody look
ahead at at the calendar like i do that that that's coming up well i do have a plan for that episode
so that episode i reserve for myself because um i'm one of the uh today with a techie
pulse so i have a plan for that episode however i've also reserved episode 2000 of HPR which will be
300 episodes of the measure and i very soon will be a reserving episode two thousand and eighty four
for those binary uh those 48 that's one yeah just calculating it okay so uh i do have a plan
i do have a plan 50l i'll tell you if you really want to know but i'd like to
know that now i wasn't questioning or anything i was just saying hey i saw that out there in the
schedule and i thought it was worth noting at this point that the show was reserved it is indeed
it is indeed a lot of shows then we had uh back to the mailing list we had a reminder of the HPR
audiobook club 14 which is on tonight which was uh the 10th or sorry the 9th and the book club
club do i say that funny book book book club the next one is at uh 2015 012 at 7 p.m.
eastern u.s. time and the audiobooks will be City of Masks by Mike Ravens Macmillan available
for the ebooks.com links and show notes the audio quality is not as bad as you remember
a few years ago okay so it's a good audio book don't be put off by the audio quality
and yes i was complaining about people uploading shows with the old intro and guess what
it was my fault i had the wrong intro on the website so apologies to everybody for me being
a noona so please please please please please if you noticed stuff on the site that's wrong
please contact me or admin at hackerbookgradio.org or see me send me an email directly
i would appreciate it then we have a whole go of um uh discussions about the new year planning show
i don't know if we want to go into them but basically i love uh either bad and that's all we have
to say about that and unfortunately our fuss stem stand proposal was rejected but i'm still going
and a bringing Dave or vice versa how would you like to look at it i'm actually bringing my
cousin nephew um he's a uh a 16 year old cousin and we'll be doing some videos or something
with us so he's quite excited to come as well so there you go
yes and i think recently the Netherlands resented there you can drink beer at 16
but i'd still think in Belgium you can drink beer at 16 so i'll always nothing to be your enemy so
there you go it's like the hard stuff does he uh you have to be 21 no you have to be 18 to drink
the hard stuff can can fall and contributing to the delinquency of minors
no i just find it funny that you know you have this arbitrary day three decide
well i i think i've said it before but i was talking to a friend of mine about you why
why you can buy a gun in this in the states is 18 and uh you can only start drinking when you're 21
and uh he put me in my place very well by saying can you don't want those two things happen
on the same day so i'm not sure what the lower age is i bought a gun uh before you can buy
long guns just uh just about any time it's you can't buy pistol till you're 21
you're not sure enough so you can do it on the same day that's it's very uh very strange
anyway so anyway enough gun talk if i uh once i saw a flying rickshaw i thought okay there's
going to be a gun talk on this show so uh we will we will be enjoying that later um one comment
about the uh moderators since we don't moderate here on hark pubic radio um lost uh
the outro team hbure community news believe it or not it's now um oh popcast promos at the end
of hbr shows so here's the deal here's the deal when we uh put together some promos ourselves
for this new year's show we sent them out to a lot of people and a lot of people were very
gracious to play the shows for uh the promos for us on their shows and i think in return um it
will be nice if we could you know play other people's promos at the end of our shows at the very end
of the outro just slap on the promo there and i was and now we've got a workflow that allows us to
do that i think it's something we can do so i don't think there's any objection to that from anybody
who do i send the promo to uh admin at hark pubic radio dot org and i was kind of thinking
that we would uh just send a link rich and uh i'll um or send us whatever or tell me where you can get
on the apple of down um i was thinking it was actually because you were doing the promo and you've
been very good to hbr down through the years that uh we definitely should be you know spread
the laws and especially if you're doing an episode you know promoting some other podcast uh and
you put it in the feed like you did uh 50 it will be nice to have their promo at the end of that show
you know yeah i agree uh if it gets you know if we get back to this complaint about oh adding stuff
and it's too long and all that i guess we could remember other shows are only doing promos once
every week or every two weeks so we wouldn't necessarily i think have to feel obligated to being a
promo each and every day but you know like i said i assume since you're suggesting it it must be
you must have a way to completely automate it so it's no more work for you to use it.
Absolutely i would not be suggesting it otherwise i'm actually thinking about the mechanism
because sometimes we might want to promote a particular show um more heavily you know if an
if an event was coming up you might want to say you know any you know that's for any shows been
posted between in the month of January you want to put on um that this event that starting in
February is coming on if you get my drift and the only uh the only comment i think about that
was you know uh by migray i think if people don't like it they can just delete the shows at the end
the only thing would be it makes these they shows that little bit longer
okay so people it's open for discussion so uh tell us what you think and we will see from there
okay the other thing that has been occupying and know a lot of my time this month has been
the New Year's resolution i made here um hpr last year and that was that we would be
able to upload shows um via the website and that is now possible you can now
upload a show um directly from the website so we don't know if anybody's seen that or tried that
i haven't looked at contribute you know and you know why how has it been edited then
yeah i've done a lot of uh tidying up of um all the pages there's uh i did uh i did stuff
on the about page for instance where i now have um you know a little bit of our history what
differentiates us uh you know some things of interest hackers you can download and listen to the show
showing you how to do that one thing i want to put in there as well is
floating the idea of an additional rss feed i was thinking
oh
Claudia you need to go fix your audio summer uh i was thinking of having an rss feed that um i don't know
how i would describe this dive uh for people who would like to that the episodes are not in
closures they're just like on the web page so that you can link that would have a link to it
instead of being an enclosure so you can read it in a blog feed and then you can choose to press play
on it do you think there's any value in that because um some people were saying that they don't want
to subscribe to your feed but they do read it as a blog or no value anybody anybody i'd have
i'd have thought it'd been quite useful actually in a in an rss reader if you're into that sort of
thing it would be quite a quite a fun thing because as it is at the moment if you
subscribe to the feed uh the the podcast feed with a feed reader then it's formatted horribly
i think we've discussed this um it needs it needs some really good formatting for rss
okay we might do that but i think the podcast a lot of the podcast reader pod catchers can also
display embedded code as well but anyway that's one for you know long windry once a year right
okay so um yes we don't filter anyway and i put in the line that i think i was i thought it was on
the website but that it was probably more in the text of that we had said down to the years
and that is how can public radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge we do not accept donations but
if you listen to hpr we do expect you to contribute one show a year this is what we mean when we say
you owe me a show so a little bit of an explanation there and then other things that were updated
is basically all they um there's the contribution link uh well just to be a long page and now
let's it up into separate ones so we've got a requested topics page with a link to how you can get
there and Dave and migray i need to talk to you about multiple series and tags at some point
but the major change is on the calendar page if you go to the calendar page you get the scheduling
guidelines now which says that you decide when you show wants to be released and there are some
guidelines in there which are uh basically what uh i think a lot of people wanted so you can pick
how many slots you want so by default the next available slot is always picked for you if you go
to the request page but here in the calendar page you've got you know the upcoming shows with a
graphic of the previous shows and you got the shows for the next two months shown which has been reserved
and which have been posted for example you know podcast recommendations is episodes 1687 so you
can click on that and actually play it and if you can't wait and then all the reserved tools
and then shows that are outside of the two months are down as also scheduled and then we have the
emergency shows but instead of um so an episode now has a link that just says available reserved now
and if you click on that link you will be brought to a page which will uh which will tell you some
stuff the first thing you need to know is that um basically how to fill in uh you put in your email
address and this show that you require and then we'll send you an email and you have 15 minutes to
click on that link that's in the email for that 15 minutes the that slot is is locked for you
after the 15 minutes is uh no longer becomes available and all sorts of things are checked in the
background as you do on that so there's basically once you click on the link you will be able to fill in
information about yourself which will use to populate the host field and information about the
episode um basically they the the show notes everything that we had in the show notes apples and now
um is now filled out on a web form and you have the option to upload via the web browser
and this is kind of the important thing so everything else is the same you know series is
click from uh link the licenses and all the rest of that stuff um but you have the option to upload
the web page and if you do that in chrome you will see a percentage um upload if you do it in
Firefox you will need to download a plugin in order to see the upload the used to uh the used to
have that feature in Firefox but not anymore um so you either need to be patient but you don't
need to upload the show via the browser if you don't want you can um if you just uh you can put
in a URL in which case uh we will pull it down the URL but be careful there it would want to be
working and there's no guarantee that we're not going to pull the URL straight away that's going to
be a human pulling that down um just as a bite by um so it would need to be available for at least a
week but if you do if you just select other then we give you the information for the call and
numbers the ftp uh my postal address where you can uh you know email your or you can post your show
over physically and then envelope and send it to me and um then if you're doing that then
your file names should all begin with the hpr and then the episode number which you know is all
detailed there it's probably making that sound a lot more complicated than it actually is so
and that's all linked on the main website and there was a lot a lot of work
yeah thanks for everybody who worked on that because that seems like it's going to make it a lot
easier for people to contribute i hope so um there's already been uh one show
posted through the mechanism and uh three three shows have been uh uploaded that way
now one of them has actually been posted so quite happy about it i am exceptionally paranoid
with the upload so you're going to see 402 errors if you do anything out of the ordinance so i
i mean it's this is not an advice to hack the thing um although if there are php programmers out
there i would appreciate you um people auditing my code because i'd like to make it available to
everybody i just got suspicious activity detected yep that would be uh one of the examples so for
example we have never had five episodes from five different people on the same day so probably now
five people have clicked on that link and it's gone oh something suspicious has happened so it's
probably blocked it well that's entirely your fault Ken because you said about half an hour ago
we do five episodes a day so somebody must have panicked yes i wish you were that easy 50 and i really do
so yeah anyway i do stuff like that i do uh i check lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of things
but it's it's been something that's been on my list for a long long time so uh hopefully it'll
it there it's not completely automated we're never going to automate this we just dump it to
a isolated directory uh we don't parse any of this stuff on the server so if you're thinking of
you know putting the big exploit on up there that's that's something that you can do i guess but
we're going to be taking it down to a completely different machine and run on tools on us
keeping Dave very very busy for the next few months but the beauty of that is we can if we need
to make changes on the web form you know the output of the forms and the show notes and the
whole stuff we can do that without having to you know redistribute a updated template or whatever
so i would ask people to use the web form and that's what i have to say about that
oh and we just missed one uh see 1930 Greetings to Afghanistan, Kabul, Kandahar,
Mazar Shreef and Harat. Happy New Year! Okay just to finish off the um what was on the news
micro a mumble how-to is broken he's having lots of problems and still having no dice getting into
um mumble there so he can't get on and i'm going to contact him because uh in my
experimentation with the streamlining the hpr broadcasting thing we're now using a vps
while we had the vps which was sufficient for what we were using and it was since capable of
keeping up and i just asked uh Josh um uh called to who's from analystos.com our sponsors and patrons
and within a few hours the server have been upgraded to uh four gig for four gig
pauses uh four gig of ram and four gig for additional process have been added on the fly and
everything is just sweet there's like less than 10 seconds of of a lag um in playing streaming out
stuff everything's in one running uh in one session mumble goes into pulse audio pulse audio goes
into um dark ice dark ice goes out into uh ice cast and ice cast just streams it out and you can
play like em player in a screen session connecting their vssh startup em player and this will go
be picked up by mumble and go up to the stream so it's really really um uh a nice solution
i would probably do a hpr episode on that as well and then we're looking for help uh putten
up the show notes i did get contacted by Bruce Paterson of the uh just letting
give me one second while i um yeah from distrawatch.com and he has an announcement that he's looking
for somebody to take over the distrawatch podcast and i don't know if people i'm sure day of you
listen to that no sadly not anymore the distrawatch podcast is a that's love buttonered sends out a
distrawatch email list and uh Bruce and his team have taken upon themselves for the last i don't
know how many years to um to basically read this out in as a script for the podcast and to be honest
they do such a fantastic job you wouldn't think it was a script but um it is uh it's very very useful
to hear what's happening in the in the distro communities what's coming up new new distrals and
stuff like that so if you're want to do podcasting but don't want to have to think of something to
podcast about then this is the thing for you and it might be an ideal thing where a group of people
can come together and say well we'll do uh if we all do one um you know five people come together
and you do one a month or one every month and a half it would be it would be ideal so yeah well i
know the king of not thinking it's pegwall he could do that i sure can i think Bruce might be put
off by the didgeridoo at the beginning of every episode though so i'm not 100% sure but i think
that's it Dave do we normally have anything else so we would want to do there miss anything do you
think i don't think so unless you want to comment on the changes we made to the css which is not
really very exciting yes go ahead actually yeah oh it was a bother it was not as i say very
exciting but um i felt that we didn't have anything css to represent tables very nicely so
we uh we agreed on a some some some css to make for example the table in this
show 1676 look prettier so so we're just saying really yeah it does actually and uh it's not and there's
a few other things that i'd like to you know fix on the css in general things somebody emailed me with
with fixes but never got back to me sending in the fixes so i know something's wrong but i don't
i don't know what the fixes are to them so please please contact me uh if you notice
issues with the website it's not set in stone so if there are improvements please send them in
also i'm interested in a navigation i have it's kind of now that you give chills and you have to
click and contribute an info team and upload and stuff so if people want to suggest a better way
of doing that but please do i've also did um validation on most of the web pages so they're
the other a few missing tags and stuff so it was nice to spot those things so if
if you're used to that sort of thing then give me a shout and with that we'll switch it back to
your regular release schedule podcasting and with that folks this is the point where i totally
turn into a pumpkin for at least four hours so uh i would implore somebody to uh pull up the shared
pad i i or my notes either one but i put both addresses in the add-off and enough that i think
people can find it and and continuing uh continue taking notes in my uh in my absence however
as long as my battery list i probably will be listing on the stream and i'm totally going to leave
the pie running so well feel free any any way to say bad things about the total mess i've made of
the podcast so far in both podcast planet and uh on the stream can we also um somebody get a
copy of the um the uh podcast plan vlog as well uh tomorrow i also need to go and do family stuff
now so uh if i don't get back to you happy new year 50 and thanks very much for uh carrying it so far
and as i remind as i reminded you last month we still need to sing
join us now and share the song with you three free hikers you three free
that was going out to my green that was one of those things where you know like i kind of wish
i were deaf so i didn't have to hear it see you later guys
at least you didn't have to see it later can time i had a very important comment to make just now
and i can't remember what the frig it was most of them have been all that important
oh yeah uh i'm loggin irc somebody remind me to dump my log
all right when all that the community news is over where are we on uh new year's greetings
am i audible yes you are fighting with the liza the chatbot
i i tried to get it to tell me to dump my log the next time i said something in irc and it tells me
you can tell yourself that so i don't rip this off don't pick a fight with an artificial
intelligence it's clearly smarter than you that's not a trick to it in the fight
never go mud wrestling with a pig you get dirty and the pig enjoys it sounds like my kind of weekend
close thinking that sounds kind of fun go ahead these to come back to improve the quality of the show
yeah now we're starting to talk about pig mud wrestling
which is fun have you ever been in a grease pig contest he was the grease pig
damn it i was about to say something you beat me to it
frickin i'm making a phone call too
so your lawyer telling you to disobey all liability for the show
is there a hotkey i can use to tell mumble to switch audio outputs in between headphones and speakers
no that sounds entirely too useful for the linux world
yes but that's why i run linux because it lets me do things like that
if you can set up a key binding that runs a script you could probably do it if you could
script it i wouldn't know how to script that it's all clicks and crap
sure it's not just a front-end or command line i mean come on
pia even pulse audio has a command line control utility
yes but i still roll with alsa
darn it's quite all i'm just going to read from the IRC for now on
no no no no it's like you too don't read the comments
tell me about comments on youtube it's like tilts don't list don't don't go to any links
uh danpeo posts limit to the mouth dot info
everyone get there now
that domain is still up but Jonathan can't afford knell like what is this one too
you can actually just do a youtube channel just buy some youtube comments and just read the
youtube comments from around the world from various channels it's quite funny
does anyone have a pool and know how to work one
used to sort of okay i let's see where's my calculation
i was told to put two gallons of muriatic acid in my pool my pool i believe is 46,000 gallons of
and i was just working on the pool light and my fricken arms are acid burned now i put the acid
in like four hours ago do you put what in your pool
don't you just put chlorine in the pool no two gallons of muriatic acid apparently the pH was high
that shit's corrosive man oh yeah but in two gallons in 46,000 gallons that's you know nothing
not necessarily to etch a concrete floor you need a ratio of one part muriatic acid to 45 parts water
and you still have to wash that off immediately wow well you'll be spending the next couple
hours in the emergency room now i just rinse the water off in the sink and then i reached into
a big pickle jar and i'm good dad's about to say you should like douse yourself with some vinegar
there balls now the redness is going away i think i'm good i haven't you tested your pH
hey you know i just i did the idiot method of testing the pH i got the bottle of
uh from the hardware store they said fill it with water bring it back and i did and they're like oh
yeah you need acid and then he dumped it in and went it'll probably be okay but don't you have
your own pH tester did they told you it's not that hard he said i probably need three to four and i
should only i'm like well let let's go low and see what happens is your pool pump on yeah i had
it on for about four hours five hours did you did you when you put it in did you all dump it into
the same spot or did you distribute it as you go in around all around because you know what as
you're poor that stuff in you can't take the vapors coming off it oh jeez i wonder why
is it because it's corrosive i will see rich this is what i'm remembering the last time i used
maranic acid i i filled up a i was wearing rubber gloves and i filled up two uh cap falls we'll say
i had about six tablespoons moving to the ship and i dropped one of the caps onto the garage floor
that i was going to etch and uh there's a really big hole there now yeah yeah the shirt i was
wearing i threw in the washing machine and did a rinse and spin and now i have to buy a new washing
machine you know now i have a short sleeve shirt i just tossed the shirt used it for grease your
egg i think you know if somebody needs to hide a body we just take it to riches pool good yeah seriously
oh my gosh i'm reading the eye or see the stuff spade well the the calculation on the pool might
be way the flock off i just measured and figured out cylinders that would occupy the space as an
average and hopefully i'm not way the heck off did you do the calculation yourself or did the
guys at the hardware store do that for you well the guy at the hardware store is like well what kind
of pull you have going on 20 or 30 thousand gallons i'm like yeah i guess that's about right and uh
then i went out and measured this morning and the number i came up with you know not not a
precise measurement because it's like uh it's almost like a figure eight it's you know like kidney
being you have a dent in one side but i got a dent in both sides and uh the number i came up with
was like 46,000 gallons and i'm kind of sorry well a 24 foot uh four foot deep pool uh in a circle
is roughly 18,000 gallons okay um on one end of my pool it's nine feet deep
so it goes from probably you know four feet to nine feet where's the manual for your pool man
manual what do you mean manual you just type man pool yeah
rope i shit like six times a day man i don't need any more fiber i was just telling you to dump
your logs okay i appreciate it because i will forget come on can i not make like a downloading
data joke i did that it thanks giving and people got the joke but no speaking of bad jokes i'll
tell you the worst one i had today or not today it was it was this year worst joke 2014 so my wife
and i are in the grocery store and we're looking for um don't start laughing now we're we're looking
things for christmas dinner and we see blue velvet cake mix and she's like blue velvet
what the heck is blue velvet i said it's like red velvet but it's coming towards you
boo i'm sorry
rich they said two to three gallons for 20 to 30,000 gallon pool yes don't swim in it
because i said like the basic dose is a quarter of a gallon per one per 10,000 gallons
pool water how high was your pH i don't know i think i got the paperwork uh oh wait what's this
what do you say two cups yeah two gallons we really meant two liters we're sorry this metric
conversion stuff screws us yeah i gotta look i think the paperwork's in my truck
i check your paperwork man some some sounds off bad
well i'm wondering you know even though i did pour it all around the pool i'm wondering if it
just stayed on the surface you know it intermingles and uh it does mix with the water and everything
and it'll dilute itself out but it's kind of slow it's kind of like when you're uh when you
have a glass of ice water or just really cold water out of the tap and then you pour your
vodka into it you can watch the vodka swirl around in it this is slower than that
yeah i because i after i realized what happened i i went around and i stuck my arms in another
part of the pool and it didn't seem so bad genius absolutely pure genius get a pH stick man
not your arms well my my wife's coming home wait you're saying your pH stick is your arm
you should use another stick
yes women and naked don't worry if it falls off well you can sew it back on later
they just use cold fusion yeah i'm gonna have to agree with Jay Lindsay on that one
and he said that guy didn't even work there he's just a clever assassin
i don't know you should definitely just check the pH again before you let anybody swim in that thing
yeah i will if you find like birds in like various states of like you know you find bird skeletons
of the bottom your pool that probably means there's too much you probably won't find any bird
skeletons there'll just be a couple feathers floating on the water no those will dissolve too i
think but just think you could you could sell a service where like people jump into like your
pool and they come out superheroes yes your pool pumps still on right now i'm heating a hot
tub right now maybe time for other time things you you are here apparently and then what else
okay so who's doing the readings while we're waiting you you brought it up i didn't bring it up
said brought it up but i'll do it and then there's what else but no it's going in and you are
here because somebody was saying i see so yeah i bring can do the readings it's about three minutes
together i think my clock must be three minutes fast then because i'm seeing that is exactly 1500
hours my time which means it's 20,000 zoos 20 hours yes 20,000 hours zulu 20,000 hours zulu
20,000 hours zulu which means it's greetings to and then 2015 greetings to much of russia and eight
more Moscow Dubai Abu Dhabi and Muskat which means UAE because that's Dubai so we're right on time
you're early now you're early with my family as well same i was at it but yeah and there's the next one
happy someone to them someone's not running intp probably not no oh wow you know
your attic acid is more commonly known by hydrochloric
at least it's not sulfuric
johnny was a conist johnny is no more what johnny thought was h2o was h2so4
that's awesome
uh in my former line of work we came across a lot of h2s which is lovely
that's hydrogen sulfide yeah you dump that in water and you've got h2so4
how do you pump a gas in water uh i'm sure there's a way to do it
you could always bubble it through or it could mix with water vapor i mean
you usually this stuff would come up through like the lakes and what not we'd be walking on
it probably makes you immune to pickles rotten egg farts
not when your well water smells like rotten eggs uh actually you don't really spell it if it's
in higher concentrations than 50 parts per million and now it's a new year
full sections can i think what those countries and i'm here 2015 for them
yeah so you're now up to 26 it's already been done though
yep we're not dropping 26 balls here or anything okay
now i'm gonna leave that alone i cut it right at that i have that beautiful
so what's this about a soda stream is that what we're turning riches pull into
a soda stream don't know well i mean it's really supposed to be like carbonic acid is what makes
carbonated water at least it would be very low concentrations of it i'm not really much of a chemist
it's my weakest subject if you talk to me about significant uh digits i might just
i don't know gochatatonic from it i don't even know what a significant digit is anymore
or significant figures it has something to do with and some i've seen that if they
check a garden's bowl nice it has something to do with the accuracy of your measurement
like you may you may have something down to the like you know the three like the the
thousands of a gram but it may not matter because your scale isn't that accurate you're you know
how you're measuring the masses and accurate or enough so that you may be really really precise
but you're off and so you only care about the the first digit pass that that's my point or example
that's about all i really understand it's your special rounding things that you only use for this
it's why i did not do very well in chemistry
twice sucked at statistics oh don't get me started on statistics if chemistry is my worst
subjects statistics is my second worst because statistics for me was hey do a bunch of math and
forget everything you learned on how to do math and just guess and you'll get the right answer
but if you actually work the problems out and get a more accurate answer you fail
he didn't tell us my my instructor for the class didn't tell us how many places to round
our decimal places to so everybody else in class did two and i did four and i think i failed
three tests in there because of that along and fortunately for me i did the show your work
thing and i'm like look i can prove that i have the right answer and i'm more right than everyone
else in the class you should fail them then i still managed to pass but he still wouldn't take
away all their marks and give them zeros i didn't understand that well you know if you don't pass
enough students you get you the class gets reviewed for quote being too hard i was going to say
there was something about Ken was talking about earlier oh though the the announcement bought
except for the fact that it's an e-speak and it's the same voice as well users like Ken is
why we can't have nice things because everyone's willing it's going to talk over the bought
if we had a thing that gave us a 30 second warning to shut the hell up before the bought
thing and then like five seconds after the bought was done doing its thing that made like
some sort of noise that would be handy you know like one of those air horn noises
talks over everyone you guys house music going in the background
trap my friend trap my apologies it is creative comments though or if it's not creative comments
it's freely redistributable i think goat your mom is freely redistributable also
so is that lemon tuna mouth thing what was it dito dodo divo tada what do you want to know
oh oh i know who you talking about doba wouldn't you like to know
it's been a while you think somebody else other nurse would talk
no never if there was a if there was a good chat subject maybe yeah
well why don't you come up with them then gen2 go
why you don't need wireless adapters on your camera i totally needed a wireless adapter on my
camera what am i supposed to do when the cop takes it from me the problem is the only solution i
know of is a wi-fi SD card that you need windows or mac to activate dude i think you just
like gave me the only real use case for having a wi-fi adapter on your camera there you go that's
right backing backing up your footage in three separate countries by the way you and i need to talk
about that in case i ever do need to back stuff up because you're in Canada and outside the range
of certain jurisdictions put the home of echelon uh not necessarily i mean u.s citizen
i'm only in like geo like a geographical different thing like i'm still my government can
still get me that's right i'm gonna need to find somebody who's not a citizen like my wife
oh that works that not just probably it's have to see something if i can back it up
about my lawyers so i'm like i'm gonna go go around recording cops but you know hey
i would well i i really can't uh we should like you know change a subject because
that i can't stream this
so how is it harp was the u.s military installation and it wasn't in Canada i'm sure the same way
they did it with the one in Cuba you know it's like we're gonna have a military institution here
and it's a hundred year wheel you kidding me the cube that's the only source of revenue in Cuba
selling tobacco or no tobacco is privately held still or it's companies yeah the coffee is collective
actually i know tons of people from around here who get on a Cuba for vacation and they love it
there because it's a cheap spot to go vacationing and it's like a flashback to the 60s
all the 1960s cars yeah they love it and as long as they stay on the uh the little resort area
there and they're completely oblivious to uh any of the social decay that's happening around them
speaking of social decay did anybody see the interview
no oh we we watched it on youtube for five bucks or five ninety nine good you know good
low-brow humor life and my wife enjoys that so we had a good time i want to see the one that
Sony pulled from the theaters yep that's it
you know it yeah i wouldn't see that film as well i think but uh yeah after Obama
satisfying or whatever it is back in the america and to the mars and on vinyl it was the news here in
the you can anyway but i'm wondering about the rest of the world when i'm going to the cinema
or DVD i can't understand your accent yeah could you speak english please no i could you
just talk more so i can like use more words me yeah you like your accent is really hard for me
to hear and i don't know why because it's different from your accent yeah but i'm listening
to a lot of different accents but where are you from you know i just told you if you just
twice in a minute yet did you miss the part where i can't hardly understand you i said to you
k yeah but what part i know a bunch of folks from the uk and you don't sound like any of them
that i know somewhere south but not to yourself
is it on the accents again i love accents man but it frustrates me when i can't hear the english
thrill how are you able how are you not able to understand if i can understand what is fine
i don't know i i you know it's funny because you're both southerners of different countries you
should like you know have select this like southern bonding thing going on but nope
i i thought i was still a southerner when i came to canada and then i discovered that 90 percent
of Canadians live within a hundred miles in the us border prick i forget where it is in
Minnesota but like 90 percent of Canadians live at a lower latitude than that
it's probably one of the more northernmost points then again considering how cold it is up there
i really don't blame them yeah you know what was good about minnesota is you can get cheap flights
to denver to go ski i thought leaving was the good thing about minnesota oh like i kind of did say that
when i was flying in from calgary and whatnot uh minnesota zink paul that airports where we always
went to and then breached off to go like to it land or whatever and miserable place shaped like a
you i don't remember the airport well there there's two terminals i guess it depends on which
terminal it goes to i'd be in the international one maybe i wasn't there yeah i flew in and out of
there a lot why do they have all the ipads everywhere to order things off the menu
um you're going to have to give us some more context in cuba or in the minnesota
st paul airport oh who knows i you know the the airport puts crazy restrictions on things
and it might be that the preferred vendor for a checkout terminal is whoever that uses ipads
i know uh you know i'm not not speaking totally authoritatively on this but uh my local airport
guy runs uh airplane repair shop you know an airframe power plant mechanic in the airport
is supposed to get a percentage of his revenue wow that sounds like a sweetheart deal if you're the
airport yeah i guess they do have to pay for you those things you know like security
well they in here's uh here's the thing it's uh it was on private property with an easement
onto the airport and so really none of that has has very little to do with anything you know just
if there was or wasn't an an ap repair business there it wasn't going to cost more or less on
security that that should be paid for through your rent but still i don't understand why
the ipads were so prevalent and so locked down oh is it for customer ordering the customers actually
use them to order yes oh now they hand them to you while you're in line or what do they do
or you just walk up uh you walk up to wherever and the little ipads are mounted on the table or
mounted on the counters mounted at the bar and you flip through the friggin ipad to order your stuff
no i haven't seen that that sounds like it's really inaccessible it's very it's very convenient
if there's only one person at the bar and there's 20 people waiting for drinks um if you're the only
guy at the bar it's very hard to talk to the bartender slash waiter uh and you know have a conversation
why because they're always looking at their ipad no because they're always running around to
everybody else they're not being a bartender they're being a friggin waiter
i have a problem with a bartender not being a bartender hey you need them to be a counselor also
yes that's why there's a tip jar hey and i'm not cutting on you it's like uh you go to places
hey i told this story i don't know in in the preer post show on tilts but i probably once in seven
years i uh the last seven years uh this summer i went to a strip club and as soon as i got in i
wanted to leave but the the most amazing thing since it's been a long time since i was out one of
these places is the girls would come around you and then if you give them a dollar they would leave
it's like no i thought it should really i didn't want you around me in the first place but
i thought it would be you pay them to keep them occupied here no as soon as they got money from
you they left so that finally it's like all right just give her a dollar so she leaves you know
he should have given her a 20 she might have stayed longer
no i'm sure she would have left you know it's like you're just not worth the economic investment
that's what it was i mean come on really give somebody a dollar for their time well no they
they'll hang around because they want to see how much you know you know what their income level
is and it's like oh this person's going to hand me singles so i know this guy over here is going to
hand me 20 gee you know free markets says i know exactly where i'm going i just hope he smells good
so it's audacity that has that theme that removes the silence?
yeah pokie tried to use it once on my music compositions and then wondered why it was off time
this isn't exactly meant to be all that mean to pokie but i was like dude yeah those
silences are supposed to be there to his in his defense i looked at the the waveform in the
in the sound editor and there are because the way i was generating that sequence of music
there are some serious silences but yeah it's in audacity this is audacity have a command line
tool yet i don't know i'm sure that a version exists for ipad and edit your podcast and get a drink
at the same time i said command line not finger line and i was attempting to be funny you know
rich is like i'm not cutting on you i think you're the only one just so we're clear everyone else is
ripping on each other as hard as they can he's too busy tending his burns yeah i think his
fingers fell off and he can't hit the push to talk key not like arms aren't right anymore
well that's a good step in the right direction no it's because they've died white because all the
flesh is falling off have you lost your tan yet he's bleached his skin are you even still on florida
yes i am you lucky bastard it was uh hang on i got a convert to do you reach Celsius
only one flying all right it was minus 20 out here this morning which is just about minus 20
Fahrenheit no it is not all right 10 degrees Fahrenheit is minus 10 degrees Celsius roughly
minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit is minus 25 degrees Celsius roughly that one's really rough
i don't remember that one and then at minus 40 they're both the same it doesn't matter it's still
cold minus to it where the heck are you i mean that it was minus 21 is in Minnesota i'm
north of Maine crap yeah i i think it was 80 here yesterday it's only 70 something now
well winner my suck for you yeah i'm going back to new york monday i'm actually Saturday
yeah it's cold snap up here right now so have fun yeah i don't know if i was going to drive or fly
or what and i i got my sports car in new york and the truck down here and i'd like it reversed
now i think you get the better into the deal right there well i want the four-wheel drive truck
in new york and it isn't now you want the four-wheel drive truck in florida so you can run over all the
assholes on the road don't know how to drive oh gosh yeah i don't know if you'll look at my google plus
feed but there was somebody that barely made it into their diagonal parking spot the basically
90% of their car was in in the roadway i've known that a lot of states have issued the the
law that makes it mandatory for new drivers to have x number of hours of drivers ad before they go
before they even get their learner's license or anything like that or before they get their
license they get their learners and they get drivers ad and then they have to have x number of
hours logged driving with an adult but i swear these kids are getting worse and worse at driving
that's because they're probably busy texting oh dude that that's so old school don't you know
about sexting please hey it's like i'm at the gun range with my daughter and her friend and
you know taking them shooting and in the second my daughter puts down the gun she's texting
as long as she put it in a safe direction first yeah actually she's been good about that
you should carry around a portable cell phone jammer with you just so you can have an aura
oh jeez death and destruction everyone that's funny i well when i was commuting on the long
hour railroad i always wanted that especially you know what the worst was the worst was when you're
working in Manhattan you're going back out to Long Island is the holiday weekends you know
fourth of july when when everybody goes to the hamptons so somebody pays three thousand dollars
they get a one one twenty fifth share of a bedroom which means they can only sleep in the bed for
six minutes with three other people every other weekend and they're yelling into their phone dude
i'm on the train i'm going out to the hamptons it's like yes you think you're cool we understand that
so you know meanwhile i'm riding the train every morning every night the whole shoot and match
and i don't get to sit because some jerk has his suitcase on the seat next to him instead of putting
in the luggage rack oh you're considered american i would have kicked that asshole in the head and
thrown his bag in his lap it's crazy the the people that you get it and out and uh we
believe it or not i turned on the tv twice and you know the last two weeks and both times the same
episode of the Kardashians and the hamptons was on but they were in matatuck which isn't the
hamptons which means they lie do you they lie there there's a north and south fork on Long Island
on the east end and the north fork is where the town of matatuck is the south fork is where the
hamptons are and only someone from there would know the difference work here although i had been
the Long Island once but i went there to see some friends and actually i've gone to Long Island twice
and the first the first time i was like in high school and you know it was mostly just hacker
meetup type stuff and then the second one you know we actually went there and there are farmers
markets on Long Island people still farm on Long Island that seems strange to me well when you
think about it um east meadow which is in nasa county was a meadow where you had your
herds graze so a lot of that a lot of the very populated areas used to be potato farms Long Island
was really well known for potatoes unfortunately now the the lifestyles of the rich and the
payments have come in and taken it over well it is honest every every time i go flying over Long
Island i look down in places that were farmland or you know that there's not a whole lot of woods
is now housing developments which is this is what they call gang plank syndrome although my house is
120 years old but it's like i finally moved out east nobody else should be able to move out east
you want to pull up the gang plank and not let anyone else come that's exactly how i feel i want
to buy a hundred acres of land somewhere i don't care where it is as long as it's a hundred acres
and i would prefer that it be a square and i want my house to be in the dead center of that square
so that no matter which direction i go outside to piss off my deck nobody can see me
yeah too bad you won't get any cell towers on that property yeah you probably can rent them out
but uh actually i'm i'm in Jupiter farms which is an unincorporated village uh there's no actually
i'm not even on a paved road here and uh there's uh no police no uh streetlights no stoplights
just uh road signs and that's about it i miss small towns hey and the funny thing is you know
10 minutes east and you're you're in a densely populated or reasonably densely populated area
i'm we sold our house i'm now in a densely populated area in a basement apartment it sucks i hate my
life uh sorry to hear that that house that you spent so long like doing an energy audit on
yeah that one broke even okay well i guess it could have been worse well it made us very mobile and
there's no way we could afford to stay there uh giving our future income situation
um
wife's pregnant i'm in school on unemployment
i hear uh pegwalls got some free rooms available
yes but unfortunately he's on the other side of the border a long way away
i don't want none of you in my house i would gladly stay with pegwall though but i don't know if
he'd cuddle is really well you know okay i think he's on the phone
yeah he's i probably very concerned so it's not me getting only one side of the conversation
no he's not saying anything wait i thought i heard a vehicle
nah maybe i was mistaken i'm confused
should be a natural state and you should be used to it all i just got confirmation that
clad too is going to be on the show where is he new zeland the urban camp all the way to new zeland
i believe he did uh even while he was floating on the raft
how i figured he was like urban camping on a steamship that one there
i believe he used his chest hair to lash together a couple logs and straddle c-turtles and
clad his way chest hair that's news to me
shit happens but you drink coffee man i i didn't know you're that close to him
well you know maybe he can send you a lock of his chest hair
the little ribbon around it with the little canoe world order written on it
oh i didn't know it's blue love clad too i'm missing bad i've actually started using twitter
because he was uh started using shows on networks
boldly but that's a good question uh what social networking tools do you guys use
twitter and what about google plus
kind of but there's no light weight application that i can put on my phone and it's very hard to
tie something like say it'll be it to google plus um i just don't use google plus because it
annoys me that i have to like it tries to tie everything i do online ever to my google plus account
oh yeah that's really annoying as well so like uh if i ever do anything in google
plus on a browser i never do google plus shit on my phone i always do it on a browser and i treat
it like facebook it is a disease that should be carefully managed well that's something i i didn't
realize i and i knew this but i left facebook open because there was something i wanted to look
at and remember to go back to and i had it open for days i'm like oh man their login days worth
of where i've served if you use android there's an app in the f-troid repo called tinfoil for
facebook you still log into facebook i mean facebook still tracks you but it runs facebook and its
own browser context meaning that you don't have to be logged into facebook on your normal mobile
browser and when you click a link it opens them in the normal mobile browser unless you change
the preferences but this basically allows you to use facebook and then facebook doesn't get to
actually know very much about what you do on it and no website gets to know about facebook's usage
and it's free software sounds good but i'm getting worried my wife was shopping and she hasn't
returned yet she's getting more pool chemicals for you i um i also use the chat part of facebook
because it seems like many many people that's all they know how to use is the little facebook
messenger thing so but that ties into middlebee so i'm fine with that yeah facebook is a non-federated
xmpp network and you can't do certain things like change your facebook password on it you have to
set up your account the right way but you know once you get that going you can do otr over facebook
which is really fun when you go back and like look at your message history in the website
and you see all these encrypted messages to each other it's great but you know it works with linux
it's facebook chat you can talk to grandma and everything's fine how would i get otr working with say
my mother you would have to get her on a chat client you can't do it on the website so good luck
with that so if anyone's using the website it's pretty much fail it's unencrypted yeah people
i've seen some people especially using like the google if you have otr on you'll see a lot of
blank lines in the content because you're it's trying to initiate the private conversations and
it's just you know the clients it most clients ignore it but sometimes you'll see a blank line
but otr is cool stuff so what's also now works do you use rich yeah the wife came home i got
unload the truck uh her car all right have fun enjoying seeing how much money you don't have
anymore what money rockin ohhoi mi hearties john what's up Brian how's it going
i'm good man i'm good how's Los Angeles treating you i'm actually not there yet i'm still up
with my dad's for another week or so um he's been having me do farm stuff well it's good to get
it all out of your system before you travel oh yeah i'm i've definitely decided i'm more of a
city boy than a country boy after all hey buddy oh boy oh boy mi hearty you're like a Scottish pirate
that's kind of crazy yeah well i'm from down these so we talk funny yeah you use funny words too
like bombic no i was thinking down east what does that what does that mean exactly
so down east is if you're in north carolina specifically carter at county if you go east of the
north with a river bridge you're down east is there an up east no there is not that's why i find
it confusing well you kind of have to go south and around your ass to get to your to your elbow
to get there but you know it's way out in the middle of the water so where about are you from
arkers island with carolina jojo obviously he's down and around around up your elbow what
you got nice although i dad retired and moved up to the mountains to and
bought a farm up here and he's been really all kinds of crop stuff and every time i'd come up here
he has me doing something honestly um don't care too much for out you know riding around on
tractors fun but the rest of his hard work and it's not the kind of hard work i like doing
i miss driving around on a tractor does she think you're tractor sexy no she never seen it
any what didn't even mind well dad's got a new tractor i got an old one i got a 53 farm all
i believe this was uh 59 international nice nice 49 sorry 49 international
what color candy apple red and light custom paint job no they're all some sort of red
unless you get a forward forwards are all blue it seems like
no this was uh repainted uh dad wired up a painter's paint booth and he painted it for him
no no there you go hot ride tractor oh it was pretty it had it painted uh Georgia colors
well Georgia traveling colors red and white
that was my present i got to pick the colors
well better than carolina blue where's that ugly duke color
and this house old everyone wears red and white
uh it's not the tarheels who's that gamecox
in sea state i only believe in the SEC
ah come on you got to play woosey teams like tech the preface with Georgia
he he he he at what fastball or football
boose well i reckon i need to think about getting back to work
dad's got me putting up a a fan in the hot house because it turns out he gets too hot in there
during the summer and so i used to be an electrician so every time there's an electrical
project i guess he winds up doing it which you just cross some wires together and burn
to place down then you won't have to work on it no more but burn down something small something small
well yeah burn down the bar and then it won't burn down the house but it'll still
it'll be enough that he won't have me doing the electrical work for him anymore
i think it's something a little bit smaller than that you know like the outhouse or the wellhouse
well well a little more sophisticated than having the outhouse the wellhouse eat nothing but a
piece of pie just taking all the ground with the motor on top and one of these fake rocks sitting
on top of that your motor how deep sure well how far down does the motor run down into the open
cavern there i'm not sure i've never looked at it when when he had the well put in they
wired it up for him so ours was on a slab it was a 500 and something foot well this is a pretty
deep one and it has earth weight no sorry that was the next door neighbors ours was three something
and we had uh we had to put uh build like a little slab then have a put a little shed up around it
and everything and insulated the shed because it's still freezing the winter
well yeah put heat strips on it oh come on it's a whole lot cheaper just to build a build and put
insulation on it i wonder what this segment will be called redneck to digress
yeah and 5150 gets to talking on here we can have some interesting conversations too
i think he's sleeping right now he'll be back later
well i wasn't got me a three pack of monsters to get me through the night
oh son you know they have this awesome thing i don't know if you've heard of it but it comes
in a little bean and they call it coffee i can't drink coffee it shit's nasty
go somewhere cold you'll learn quick now pass i'm i'm moving out the soakow here in a couple of weeks
i i'd drink coffee on and off and i only liked it black and i'd have maybe one cup every two
three weeks a month and then when i moved main i drank coffee by the pot because it was cheap
and hot and it wasn't hot water well i reckon that's one way to do it i just do hot chocolate
oh hot chocolate ain't cheap yeah that's true where you could buy the big
big big 50 pound bag of cocoa and make your own i was couch surfing i don't think i could afford
that at that point in time yeah never quite done the couch surfing thing i might i might do that
at some point a little word advice don't hey
i know just saw a commercial on the tv so there's a date inside just for farmers
farmers only dot com exactly must have prissy city girls all over it
yeah i got to admit though i do like me a girl with a country accent
i just like a girl with accident i don't really care what uh what accident it is as long as
there's one there and as long as i can hear it yeah that's true that's true
as long as they don't bloody yanky accent
yeah yeah yeah we don't need no yankies around here does a canadian count as a yanky
and we let them slide by sort of but until it comes to the winter and that well what it was
was back home all the Canadians would come down during the winter because it's a go to the beach
well i know i'm in Canada now it's bloody cold
yeah i reckon we'll let you slide by because you kept Canadians kept the economy going back home
during the winter yeah my in-laws are planning to be uh snowbirds they're planning on migrating
down to the south every winter they're looking at myrtle beach and uh that general area
yeah well if that's their thing then myrtle beach has got it for them but they don't like
if they're not the types to go visit Vegas and they probably shouldn't go to myrtle beach
uh we actually go that's our family vacation we get a couple condos and what not there
and my folks from back in Georgia get a couple places and their folks by in-laws up here get a
couple places and it's just like a whole herd of us just move down in my grade and party for four
weeks on and off some some of us are there for one week some are there for four weeks you know those
lucky retired folks yeah well i reckon that's my dad i never saw too much benefit from driving
from the beach i lived at to another beach it has a whole lot more people
ah well you're on a beach what's the point of going to another one that's my point
unless it's got bigger waves yeah just wait for her can get plenty of big waves in
guys i'm gonna have to mostly step away from a bit here we got a minor emergency
at work all right well peace bro well i actually got to get back to work myself so i'll be back on
here in a little while all righty don't you leave me with them i will leave you with them and you
will like it don't worry buddy i'm still here y'all have fun bro start a fire in the kitchen or
take care of your work problem no we'll just give me it will just give me three problems because
i'll have to start a fire using regular expressions oh fun i think i'll rather put up fencing then
deal with regular expressions right now anyway i'm off i'll be back on a little while
3 30 if you can hear me i'm gonna come down and shove this thing and i'm drinking right up your
dareier he might like that i'm just reading what he put in IRC and it says man cobra too is
working on that southern accent but he really sounds like Bob and Doug McKinsey these days
all right well i'll see you later have a good one man don't party too hardy
peg wall yep what are you doing it lunch hey handsome pirate how are you
you scared him into silence is that how it works
must be downtime oh are we nine minutes closer to new years somewhere
yes i hope you have the little thing you pulled up because i don't then i'm too lazy to go find it
i'd have to know what utc is and being a pilot that's kind of embarrassing oh i know where to look
how do you not know what utc is well what it is now i don't know if we're minus four or minus five
right now max don't run on utc oh i can't wait for summer spring i can't wait for spring
i think hell dead middle of winter i can't wait for the dead middle of winter when the days
are a little bit longer and it's not dark at four thirty hey three thirty you should get on the
the little mumble thingy okay so we're coming up on 2100 zulu so it's new years or in eight minutes
should i announce now i'll wait i'll let everybody be in suspense yeah let us be in suspense we
get no good conversation going on right now that's anybody taking notes notes of what the
conversations and put them in the etherpad yes i have i'm very busy i'm i'm too busy to do that
i'm playing a game right now and i know pegwals too busy doing nothing i'm eating lunch
you made yourself hamburgers more than one no i'm eating dirty rice
hey i i put you only eat ramen noodles why are you eating the rice the second time
recycling don't you find it a little chunky and clumpy?
nah it's when it's a really good spread on the same age just like that Australian food you love so
much yeah Benjamin is fantastic oh i didn't say the name for a reason it makes me gag
is that kin valent it is hi are you tired yep can you gonna make the announcement in five minutes
yeah i'm gonna do that and then we're gonna think we start the stream but let me just check that
i i did that too and i flushed after
i hope you guys are all feeling in the show notes as you go oh yeah they're all full
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we got that covered that's a nice big line of bullshit for you can
somebody was funneled that was plus uh he suddenly stopped
i think Rome might have been doing it but he just had to go run take care of it far
i think it's awesome that we talked about a pool
yes well three times eights and twenty four did we have figured it out three and a quarter
yeah i don't like quarters okay the question is should this be a four-hour segment or a three-hour
second i say use the very scientific any mini money mo method or the faster scientific method flip
a coin yeah that helps i'm sorry can i'm just very lazy today as can be seen by your show notes
so what have we been talking about sometimes you use nothing so is this now what time
uh we didn't really have a topic we were talking about uh there was another southern
failure hopped on we were red necking it out there for a little bit and that was about the
only thing of note okay so we are hitting very soon another time so
yeah i'll carry it for another hour i think uh and uh stop it then we'll see how we go
sounds like a lovely plan okay let's welcome the next time zone which is
2100 hours UTC and we welcome Iraq and 20 more Baghdad
Karatul, Nairobi and Adesababa and 20 more happy new year everyone and if you're in any of these
regions please feel free to join HBR as a host and submit your shows via the brand new spanking
if you're a website which i now need to unlock one moment while i do that and while you're submitting
your show please correct hands pronunciation yes thank you i think that goes for everybody you
i all everybody will be treated equally here in HBR you will all have your names butchered
equally badly by my good self
i'm just wondering have any of you guys come across the uh talk of the right to be forgotten case
here in europe new is there new information i'm familiar with it but i i don't know anything new
about it well it's not actually anything you per se it's um just the reporting of that in the press
um doesn't give a hundred percent but i i the funny thing about the right to be forgotten is
i think the us and you can our little law and and Australian laws kind of based on
British law yeah so it all comes from the same
um pot by good work if you can play dry's yeah i'm making all this stuff up now so
feel free to correct me from wrong but one of the things that i noticed when i moved to the
Netherlands was they they're slight subtle differences you're like you're into McDonald's no
not that one it's still little things uh subtle things in bay their approach to the law was uh
one thing and uh in the whole right for right to be forgotten case was taken by somebody in spain
who had gotten bankrupt over something or other and then had taken his case to the european court
and said that although that there is a right to be to have this information forgotten and the
fact that it was coming up on google for him meant that google worked on removing these
um these files related to this person and in the reporting of that especially in English
speaking podcasts and stuff and English speaking articles i found that people are slightly missing
the nuances in it in that and uh just thought maybe as a topic it might be something interesting
to happen to chat about namely that in the about the right to be forgotten and certain other
rights for example in the Netherlands if you commit a crime they won't release your name so you
will be just known as um you know i would be known as ken f are are um uh k fallen whichever happens
to be the least um they will use the name the the last name if that's the most common or the first
name if that happens to be the most common so um the idea being that even though a criminal
it gives the even though somebody is convicted of a crime they're they still feel that the
criminal has rights that they shouldn't get named well they can um they can come out and start
in your life after they've rehabilitated themselves so i can't imagine for me am i distorting
or is it just me locally too locally it's probably because i had pushed i was talking so probably
looped through okay all right so here are the united states there's a couple of things that
that ought to be discussed and and one of them is an arrest record which is not a crime it's not a
conviction uh some papers publish that so the joke was in high school that all of the teachers
would look through the paper to see who was bad over the weekend yeah and that's uh that was
something like when i was living in the uk there was a lot of things about pedophiles going around
and they were you know they uh the mob rule were losing house uh finding pedophiles in the neighborhood
when you say that i i think about uh pita which is people eating tasty animals
no no no no no it's both sad you know uh people with a criminal record for uh for um
amusing children essentially so now here in the united states they categorize it as a sex crime and
you could be and i don't know for certain i heard this and i haven't done any research on it
but urination in public could be considered a sex crime and you would have to report your location
basically like a pedophile would that's only in certain states oh my gosh god bless you if you have to
pull over to the side of the road in that state now uh i did work for a company we did pre-employment
background screening and one of the things is a criminal background check now there it falls under
both state and federal fair credit reporting acts and the interesting thing about that is if the job
that you're interviewing for is expected to pay you $40,000 or greater they can go back seven years
in your history if it's supposed to be less they can only go back four years in your history
so um now that's for a third party looking up the information now if i was going to hire one of
you directly i could conduct my own search personally and go back to the day you're born
and this is where the right to be forgotten when comes in for a start personally you could not
as an employer ever look up somebody's record that's something that you're not allowed to do
aside from what's available publicly so even if you are a pedophile and you've murdered and
massacred people after you come out of jail for a start your name wouldn't be on any records except
with the police department so if i was employing you i would have to get you to fill out a form
you would have to go into the police department with that form and you would hand it to the police
and they would give you then they would give you would give the police permission to tell me
the outcome of that uh search which would be a binary yes or no obviously when you're going in
with that form you would know the results because hey you've done the crime so you were going with that
form and then as a employer i would get an answer back from the police yes this person has been
cleared or know this person is not suitable for this position no other information is given out
so that's how like when when your teacher or something they make sure that uh the checks are
stimulated while privacy is still the privacy of the person is still respected and the information
is not shared and that kind of goes core to what they're what they're trying to protect
with the right to be forgotten case so as you as you can see there's a massive
mind shift difference between the US, UK and Ardons Australia whatever and continental Europe
yeah we actually sub our clients because they were concerned about legal issues they wanted
us to make the decision and basically there were i think four states so there was clear
there was terminated immediately there was um do not promote and i i don't know if there was
another one but we would based on a matrix that we agreed upon with the client would return to them
those decisions they wouldn't see any information but they basically would say hey not an issue you
know eligible for hire or if it's a recurrent check like a driver may go through recurrent checks
for their driver's license and other things and they may get a you know terminated immediately
or a do not do not promote based on something happening in their history
um and the other thing that was mentioned quite a lot in the arguments against this right that it
was you know something that the EU was pushing on people but these low i did some research here
in the Netherlands so i can't speak to what it is in Spain or Germany or some other countries
and this was an addition that was added to the Dutch constitution in 1986 so it was put in there
to protect people's information in databases as they were coming online then so it is something
that you know any person coming in doing business in the EU should have known about so
it wasn't like you know there was an argument oh this has been this is something that's been
pushed down Google's throat at this point but you know it was on the books and this is something
that they should have known about so i i i don't think things are as clear there as you know
what you're hearing in the news reports and the other issue that has come up has been
um when google was asked to remove those searches they removed them from google.eu and google.co.uk
and all the all the local domains within in that are operating within europe however they didn't
if you went to google.com you'd still get the search even if you're originating from europe
oh boy yeah and you know google were arguing are and google were arguing and they in the tech
press were saying well these are american domains and and that's fine uh if that was the case for
if you went to google.com and wanted to watch a video for instance that's available in
if i wanted to watch the latest saturday night life for instance or whatever and um
um that's available in the u.s then i would get an immediate this is blocked here in your country
so technically everybody in europe is well aware that google can block based an ip address and not
domain names so that i thought was also uh into you into a little bit of what so uh yeah those
are a few things other other than that i don't really want to go into i can't really add a lot
to the to the to the case except those were two noticeable things that i did i did notice
well that's kind of interesting but the the other thing that goes on is uh you know in a
pre-higher process or maybe a post-offer process where they do background checks is um you know
they want to check credentials so if you say you have a doctorate in computer science and you
came from Brazil how do you validate that in some of these things can be a little tricky one
yeah that's actually a useful one for us uh yeah just on the on the right to re-forgotten case
was this uh mayor and one of the local towns has now been sued by a guy who was a pedophile who
has been put into uh temporary housing above a nursery and uh the town bit mayor released that
information and you know there was protests and he was driven out of his home and all the rest
and he's now suing the town because they they gave his information out at which point that
was thinking you know one one half of me was going well yeah good for you but then it comes out that
his uh preference was for older you know children not that it was on the good but i don't really
that did you know that's totally creeped out yeah it's it's just weird what you what you need to balance
on uh what that what is balanced so it's never really as black and white as uh as things are
to be and needless to say as a father of three children i have very very very uh strong opinions
and what should be done to pedophiles just bye bye yeah that boy see i i don't know if i can talk
about the situation as a business policy and if you did enough research i don't want to name
specific names but we're we're caught in a tricky situation once and uh we found a way to get
enough information to the client legally that they could figure it out on their own yeah and that's
that's the thing here that you wouldn't you just wouldn't be able to do and that's what the whole
right to be forgotten thing is about and although the funny thing is you can go into the library and
you can look up that person's you know you can look up September 1986 and find out that joe b
was arrested for whatever so you could do it that way but you know it's not
as accessible i guess correct so but then again it would also be joe b and thus
another person so like when you're going to like newspapers and whatnot old newspapers in the
library yeah looking things up it's already redacted yeah no it's like published in the first place
so my name would i wouldn't be i would in in our country would be can follow most sentenced to this
you know did this terrible thing or accused of this terrible thing or whatever um whereas in the
Netherlands it would be kf if my name was because my name would be pretty pretty unique um anyway
it would be just initials or something you know that i kind of touched on this topic and i
was just talking to my wife about this the other night when when you talk about anonymizing data
and i've worked at two different hospitals and we would anonymize data and we we went through some
pretty uh tortured methods to really abide by and go beyond what any uh regulations would be
and the the reason you want to work with pseudo live data or anonymized live data is because
there there's going to be corner cases that you run into uh when you're writing software
so it is important to have that information so you see these instances and are able to code
for those issues now um let's see both my cars have gpses in them and one is a general motor's
car from 2007 so it has the on-store system and it has a cellular phone and data system you know
it'll do cellular data and same thing the genesis has a gps and cellular data so both those cars
they can be reporting back their position but apparently that information is anonymized
and it's a little like i know both cars um if you have the service they can turn them off they can
unlock them they can do a bunch of things remotely well along with locating them and you know who's to
say there's not a kill switch for these vehicles or you know hey wondering where riches if they don't
know yeah exactly who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's who's
what about uh you uh dang it sorry i'm ready to get the 1970s carbureted olds and feel with uh
breaker point ignition where we're the most sophisticated electronics in there or the radio
yeah it's scary actually looking inside an engine though uh you know open it up a car and remember
taking the part of those having an old four deathscorp mark three and then just completely
replacing whole sections of it in the in the evening and uh Gundam's the scribe area by
fixing the thing up and then heading off again. Was that a 2.3 liter engine?
i have no idea or are you in europe and you're not allowed to have engines above two liters?
uh this would have been uh probably i have no idea i was never that big into cars for real
cars only got you from point a to point b a that is pretty much it mostly away from point a
which happened to be balibar that a was for you 3.30 looking at the show notes here for the next
episode gones gones and wargones i guess it's easy to identify when you come on rift
what's your opinion on the the right to be forgotten again do you do you agree with it or
are you opposed to it? well it's uh it's uh i do agree with it yeah but then
i do agree with it because the front of mine um she um she had a you know she was young and she went out
with this guy and he ended up there there's a thing where if you live together here after six months
you come into this default sort of marriage like arrangement kind of yeah well you can get a contract
and whatever and you can get you specifically have to get a contract saying that i'm not sharing
my goods and services or whatever but anyway she had then ended up in a situation where she
was liable for all this debts that he had and so for five years she was on the credit watch list
and whatever so then after the five years even though she had done none of this stuff was
hers aside from the fact of you know falling for it falling for a guy i mean which we all do
right off you know maybe everything wants um then uh you know after five years that was all
that was all gone then there was no problem getting the mortgages there was no problem with um
you know credit cards on the rest so and then you then you have the situation where okay you're
going in and you have um somebody's done something and they do really it does work on the assumption
people can rehabilitate which i think is a is a nicer way to to work from well i i think the issue
there there's a couple of issues is recidivism uh rehabilitation and the context and uh you know if
if you have a crime where there's a very high rate of recidivism and if it's somebody in like say
a pedophile applying for a daycare center that that's a fricking jam on the brakes issue
yeah but what's he a pedophile for you just say a pedophile is he a pedophile because he slept
with a 16-year-old or is he a pedophile because he was uh in possession of some awful pictures of
10-year-olds right okay and that's and that's what they write to be forgotten thing i think it works
out well but it does require you to put down your your your basic instinct of picking up a club
and going over and bottering somebody to uh you know well first off you shouldn't treat anybody
in a way that you wouldn't want to be treated so if you you got feelings that go on and beat
somebody upside the head if you don't want that to happen to you don't do it but regardless of that
when you when you come across folks who have committed crimes and they've already served their time
I'm not so sure it should be forgotten like that's that's their chip on their shoulder they they
have that put behind them and to grow from and learn either that or they fall right back into it
but they're released to the public it it shouldn't harm them that uh they've been quote-unquote
rehabilitated if they weren't rehabilitated they should still be locked up uh if uh if folks are
not being hired because they have a criminal record then they're being discriminated against
and i see no difference in between that uh as somebody not being hired because they're a woman
or because they're black or because they're max can or whatever there's no difference to me
whether you discriminate over somebody because of something that they did or if you discriminate
because the color of their skin this is all the same thing the thing though just to be clear about
the right to be forgotten is only the right to be forgotten by the public at large
in general it does not mean that you're going to you have the right to be forgotten by the
penal services or the law enforcement or the government or whoever there are circumstances like
the example that we get that if you're going into health care are you going into any any
the sense of the various you will get investigated and your entire record going back to the
beginning of time will be analyzed so it's there are safeguards there to protect society in general
so it's not it's not a black and white issue but i'm i'd be very much in agreement with what you're
saying there yeah i don't fully understand the issue but that was just my two cents on what i
was hearing yeah the the point in this case is that google are getting that this guy went bankrupt
and he's an after five years that should be scrubbed from his general record
bankrupt five years then he could start a new life and do his thing what happened was later on
after the five years he was being googled and that information was still coming up so
he said well either right to be forgotten so this should be taken off the books google should
be moved as the court said yes you do you have a right to be forgotten should be taken off the books
and that was the right to be forgotten case yeah all right so he should be forgotten in that country
not the world no you should be forgotten in the region that signed up to that law which is
Europe so this is a pan-European thing so a lot of these countries have that laws and all
they state all the country states have signed up to this doctrine so it is EU law now
so the EU law is that if you are in physically in Europe that should not be found that information
should not be available to you except of course if you go down to the library in that country and
you make a specific you know you got a private investigator and you you go the extra mile to find
out about this guy yeah then it's going to come up because it's a matter of public record yeah
not a problem but this guy's point was he does have a right to be forgotten so it shouldn't be
the very first case that comes up on on the guy's website google could probably use their
and chio ip blocking that they use for their multimedia not protection but DRM of sorts
and that is exactly what I was saying that's why I was calling bullshit on their on their argument
that no we don't want to censor the web well you're already censoring the web you know
if this is a law in Europe you have a choice of obey the law in Europe in Europe and I completely
agree that if you're googling this guy and you're sitting in Texas and that information is on
file servers in Texas or then it should be displayed in Texas yeah wait let me ask you I just
want to do the opposite here in play devil's advocate if google said go after yourself what are
they going to do block google yeah they did it with microsoft 500 million fine day for how many days
500 just thousands fine they there was millions that were bleeding out of microsoft over the browser
case they have they have done it and they are thinking about it and this is a this is a this is a
law just like everything else and google has a choice like they did in china if they don't want to
obey the laws of the land that they're operating in but it's not like we are china or you know
Europe is China where you have the great firewall yeah but it's the same thing if you're operating
in the country you know whatever you say about the regime or whatever you say about is you're
going to operate there under the rules of that country I'm guessing yeah otherwise you're you're
not operating within the country now if there were if google didn't happen to have an operation
within spain and and or within the EU and this information was stored in servers in data farms
in in Texas well then you know the EU doesn't have a leg to stand on go after yourself yeah because
the information's not in europe but maybe about european system you could argue I suppose but
it would if that would be a dangerous road to go down on what we're talking about here is
information aggregated by servers that are located in europe about people who are located in europe
and they clearly violate the laws that they know about because they've been unstacked your books
in these countries at least right four years longer than google has existed longer than they
I looked it up and they went into law on the same day that on the same later on that year the first
TCP IP protocol was proposed so this is how far back these things are going okay I've got a
slightly different take on this because there's another issue that you're you're not even thinking
about on this and that is what is the source of the information here's here's a question for you
let's say a case had become internationally known was written about by american newspapers american
publications and stuff and european publications now that information could be aggregated both
in europe and in the us how do you determine what information you can show to somebody who's from
europe if they are trying to search through us servers there's no geolocation information
associated with the individual very fine green pieces of information and that's you know basically
saying to google you actually have to go back now and supply geolocation information on every
single article that has a mention of any person in any country any place seems to be kind of a
fact you're you're taking you're taking this to the stream in the in germany for instance is a law
that you're not that they're not allowed to display Nazi symbols they uphold that law and if you're
in germany you can't find those that information yeah so this is an accepted this is an accepted
thing about the reporting of that particular case in general the reporting about that case is
completely open and should not be censored in any way if they because it's a reporting of factual
events that are ongoing at the moment and the guy who has brought the case has done so in public
so the reporting about him will be forever associated with the fact that he had bankrupt
20 years ago yeah absolutely not a problem but within the laws of the country that you're in
you need to abide by whatever those laws are and i don't for a moment agree with the argument that
um it all it's too difficult to do because it's not the these are these are issues that they
have tackled that is are being tackled by by technology companies they can identify people's
faces worldwide across the globe they can you can show them put on a picture and they can
identify your face from the millions of people that are out there they can produce a self-driving
car this is not a non-solveable problem it's a problem that you don't want to it you tackle i
agree with that but it's a problem that they met for themselves because they ignored the law
for so long okay i have a very fundamental disagreement with you because unfortunately
unfortunately a lot of these technologies like facial matching and facial recognition
aren't working correctly there are lots of of cases where they are misidentifying people and
the the fact that companies are using them because they think it's going to gain them some kind of
financial gains doesn't is not really driving the technology it's the financial gains it's driving
that okay so i wouldn't you i wouldn't even i think you're missing a point there but my point was
that they are capable of tackling complex problems if they put the mind to it so the argument that
it's or it's a very difficult problem yes i'm not saying it is or it isn't
the fact is they have teams of highly qualified highly trained engineers who are used to dealing
with complex problems and finding solutions so in one case the argument is you can build a self-driving
car but you can't do this you can build face recognition but you can't do this both equally
complex in their own fields yeah if they worked correctly yes and if they were definite solutions
to a problem yes neither of those are actually solutions to a problem at this point in my opinion
that's part of the issue is we see all this hype around technology it's unfortunately broken
technology so just because something's out there because marketers wanted to push it out there
don't think that it's actually technologically sound yeah but it's i do think you're missing a point
there boss so i go in the head over i said i still think he's missing the point there
well how am i missing a point you're you're arguing something different you're you're you're
both arguing but you're not arguing about the same thing Ken's arguing about a privacy issue
and you're arguing about the technology no the argument is that unfortunately the technology
as far as the government wants it to be applied does not conform to what their requirements are
and unless the government wants to put for for the system that says okay now all newspapers and
all all these these businesses have to go back and and basically provide the information to
Google so that we have all the geolocation information associated with every scrap of information
that's out there that's absolutely guaranteed that this can be done that's not
What's been asked right first start a newspaper reporter reporting about this
incident Google is allowed to index that yeah a newspaper is also allowed
indexes but this information is coming from sources that they know where it's
coming from in the first place but take take this for an example unit archive
has huge actually it's not on the internet archive maybe it is I can't
remember where it is now but Aaron Swartz had actually gone through and pulled
a bunch of court records and had actually made them available publicly because
they were supposed to be available publicly okay and all that's basically
stored right now on servers in San Francisco now say somebody had done the
same thing in Europe had pulled those court records and had stored them on
servers in the US now there's no geolocation information for a lot of those
records it just was never encoded with that no they took them from there in the
first place the documents were sourced from there in the first place the
documents themselves will have regio de lequa blah blah
spania on them they may or they may not yeah well one of the problems is that
you see stuff stuff it's out there in these systems those heavily
protected heavily modified and heavily changed to a point where you can't
always necessarily identify them or their their images that aren't necessarily
going to scan correctly if you try to do a CR on them you're basically putting a
lot of burden on people to actually make certain that they attach extra
information to things that's just not happening now that's what I'm saying
yeah it's not happening now but that's my point the point is it should be
happening if that's the information that they need in order to do this it's
information that they should have been adding the whole time as they were doing
their indexing because it's the law but you can't wait to blame on Google for
that Google's one company you're talking about Google against every government
in the world at this point every every company every local search engine in
Spain has had to deal with this every newspaper every outlet every search
engine in the Netherlands has had to build their systems knowing the laws of
the country that they're operating it not knowing the law of the country is
not an excuse to get out to get away from I can't remember that it's not
you're getting out of jail free card exactly thank you I'm not saying it should
be but I'm saying that you shouldn't be delaying the blame on one company
because you're not basically dealing with the the facts of making certain that
the source information is properly available that you have the proper
information associated with those files the source information is coming from
government policies if you choose to talk about metadata away then you are
knowingly you're not doing the job then the new that if there are
hiding this information it's coming it's sensitive personal information they
were going to be archiving the law says that after five years they have to
retract it and they have not done so I don't see what's what's on to the
center here in the new that the information is about people because of the
databases where they get in the front what's rocket science in this there's
so many different scenarios where that information can be handled in so many
different ways you just can't guarantee it I mean that's one of the problems
right now like I'm saying right now you know here we had like Aaron sports
went ahead and pulled a whole bunch of documents from the court system and put
them out there now those are publicly available documents they're they're
open enough I could pull those down archiving someplace on a server anybody in
the world can do the same thing and archive them then you've got no guarantees
of what controls are available over them and Google comes along and
Nexus it how are they necessarily going to identify that these documents that I
have named ABCD and E are actually those court documents they may not know
that yeah but there's a lot of things here that you can get through and you
can say that hey we don't necessarily know everything I completely agree with
your point but what we're we're not talking about that we're not talking about
Aaron Schwartz case which actually doesn't apply anyway because it's American
laws those and that information should have been public that's what he was
trying to get out to make them public and don't don't get them wrong I am a
huge advocate of having this information in the public open rights and all
the rest of it however we're not talking about that we're talking about this
information it's only source is from government documents so you on servers
that are located in Spain operated by a company that is registered in Spain
and yes they're arguing that that's the laws don't apply to them and other
companies that perform a similar function in Spain are doing what are
complying with the law correct I'd love to see an audit of the systems and
find out how accurate it is that's I mean that's what I'm pointing out is that
you're you're kind of walking into a point here where you're saying okay we can
make the technology do anything yeah you can do a point a lot of times I see
stuff like this come up and I know from having been in places where they
fully have tried to comply with laws and actually go ahead and update this
information try to add this stuff 90 a lot of the time it's not accurate at
all and I just I think that there's a lot of things where again if you're
gonna say that a company has to be able to comply with something they need to
make certain that the facilities are correctly implemented to make that work
and I think a lot of times we see governments take these actions without doing
that at all yeah but this was in place before the internet correct exactly so you
think that when they converted documents from offline to online they went
ahead and had all the facilities to actually do things like geolocation
geolocation didn't even exist when they converted the documents the did
because we're physically there in the building do you think that was encoded in
the documents when there was nothing in the document formats of the time to
actually support your location okay okay where do you think the servers are
that those documents are stored on so the government scans the man where are
the servers you know good question especially now look at the cloud you have
almost no guarantee it's not 19a to say where are they at that point they might
have been there now you don't know that you know that's what I'm saying that
that you know the point is you can you can say anything when it started it was a
good idea the problem with our governments are they they do not sit there and
update things to actually handle the newer situations and so it should over
complicate in this subject no I'm not not at all and also you're not taking into
account that there is another law that is extremely that's extremely and
everybody's face that all companies need to sign up to them that's the
privacy law what you're allowed to do with European citizens information is
very very restricted you're only allowed to use it for the information that you
require and you have to stay beforehand what information that is so they know
about this it's up standard operation procedure I love that phrase standard
operating procedure that's like going to the dark and the dark tells you you're
gonna feel some slight discomfort 80 days I apologize over here come back in a
week
but I do I do get your point I mean to stop on you soundly oh you guys you
didn't find you I was stopping on me I don't care do you need a hug no not at all
I'm laughing I have my fun debating the stuff hey look somebody had to take up
the devil's advocate position for real I'd see the only thing I was doing as
I thought hey here's a chance for me to actually jump in and have some fun
basically trolling you guys for a while hey so I mean by the way me defending
Google what the hell is that it's just a little weird to podcast over the last
few months that have been discussing this and not one of them has brought up the
fact okay well the you know these are the laws of the country you have to
respect those and you know there is another approach and that's the right
to privacy and there's another report that the right to be forgotten this
and something you and it's scary the amount of statements that are made and
I'm thinking if this is the level of reporting and all the other things that I'm
assuming are taken for you know factual research topics then it's a bit
scary all around but now that I've said it on the community news I can get
all my chest for you okay that killed a conversation sorry about that oh no
Claudio Miranda killed the conversation just need to make sure that everyone knows
that no I think I think I killed it when I finally admitted I was trolling you
guys cool no I stopped talking what I had the sling that phones across the room
what is up with Claudio's set up he's using plumble and he doesn't know I'm
guessing he doesn't know how to set it up I don't know how to set it up there's
nothing I know although in my Galaxy S3 it's added awful and I don't know if it
sounds better on other phones did you use headphones with your Galaxy S3 yes
Claudio get a pair of friggin headphones dude no no it's still sound
awful on the Galaxy S3 with headphones good did it have bad reverb because he's
not going everybody back in no didn't do that all right I can deal with Gorkhan
audio quality you know that's a funny he keeps saying that whatever reverb back
into the system is somebody else but when it's only him that has the mic
keyed up and you know if it was anyone else but this guy is a ham radio guy he
should know better right I love him to bits you know that although I still
think he should be doing more ham radio shows on HBR a lot of them all has
Gorkhan done HBR ham radio no he wants to give us a few ham radio podcasts
there because there's Linux and the ham shack that is a good show I like that
yeah I haven't listened but and I do have an interest in him but I guess not
enough because I got interested in a hundred other things too believe me that
can happen guys I'm gonna have to go for a minute and do some family stuff so
oh 15 minutes what's gonna happen 15 minutes we we will have been an hour late
for someone and hey if that works we can tell him in 60 minutes why is it
confirmed by Dave can multiple people edit this thing at the same time yes
it's in the bridge so what happens when you reload the page you get the
whatever's the version at that time what happens if you edit something and
someone else edits something in a different place does it save them both as a
revision yep can you look at can you then reload the page and look at each
revision individually yeah look at the timeline thing we're talking about the
e2pad I'm guessing yes we are so if you look at the timeline slidebar up at
the top it allows you to go back to the conversions it also allows you to save
particular version right now I only see versions edited by me and Ross yep this
is genius isn't isn't it just brilliant and it's open source right it is I think
the project got this it was a Google project and got discontinued
we have their own website now Google you mean no etherpad I need to run and go
make coffee and get dinner started because my tummy is growling okay you do
this I'm hanging in for a little 12 minutes I hopefully will be back in time to
hit the stop and record button again on my recording on the hour I'm ready for a
nap I don't know about you you probably been up for 20 something hours I had this
weird thing right well I had to work today unfortunately so I was only I was
around to start stuff off with this be 5050 card that is weird thing last night
where I just was late to bed anyway because I was working and then I just woke up
at 4 o'clock like my ass just couldn't I get back to sleep wide awake so I decided to go
down have breakfast and I caught the 5 o'clock train into work oh man I was wrecked though
I had to I was sleep when I came home which is why I'm okay now yeah I can go for a nap but my wife
she wants me to put a light fixture up you know emotion detecting light over the garage cool
now I'm hoping I got all the stuff I need for it really the big problem is just
figuring where I'm going to tap power from you neighbors yeah we don't have we don't have
single-payer electric in the United States yet what single-payer electric I'm making a goof on
single-payer health insurance what single-payer health insurance basically the government pays for it
what we think is here everybody has the same everybody has to have health insurance by law
and if you can't afford it they'll pay for free so but that means then you have the choice
of whatever hospitals you want to go into that works but provided your plan supports that but
then again the standard plan includes all kids I think up to 21 now and you know you don't
go into weird stuff if you want to the number of times you can do IVF or if you're if you get knocked
down on a when you're skiing abroad whether they'll provide you with a helicopter whether you
have to pay for that yourself you know that that sort of stuff was the most stuff includes like dental
and pretty much everything yeah I used to ski without a helmet then I got hit by a tree
one of the funniest videos and I presume it came out okay because the guy uploaded to video
or to YouTube I saw this year was you know the skiing down the mountain following somebody else
those tracks and the guy with skiing skiing skiing between the trees and whatever and then
it goes all from between two trees into the darkness and all the years like oh no
I was a place where power power of lighters had skied off you know into the overlift
where I really hope the guy was okay yeah I was in hey guys back hey excellent you can do the show
not so I was just gonna have to wait so I think I've got the rest of the day myself which is good
living the clock in the morning you're back from the nice tool you're on earlier yeah that's
on last night I jumped on this morning just for a little bit but I couldn't speak so one of those
things we've got someone else in Rome so what's it like in 2015 I don't know session last day oh it's
not real I suppose it's nice that's quite warm outside but it's a little overcast but yeah it's
not TV it's relaxing I don't really really really been outside you should go for walk no you have to
be on the New Year's show I know but I hope that myself now it's quite good I really wanted to go
the New Year's day sales but I'm gonna miss out because I wanted to get a laptop I'd have to
worth it I have to wait till the next sales in a couple months so it's what get chance to get
down today I've got cash in a couple months I think I'd rather pack cash and put on a credit card
yeah good plan I'm editing some shows and we're believing in about seven minutes
thankfully we posted the show for tomorrow is up now that's the pressure off and if I get this
on up then the pressure will be off for Friday as you eat and the stats they hit normally have you
this one but when they hit you now that's yet it's still making it so it's just past india now
so we haven't hit here either in the Netherlands all the people are sitting off fireworks still
there's a lot of people around because there's no snow so people who normally go skiing
are forced to stay at home so there will be a lot of fireworks tonight
hey it's the middle summer here so it's nice getting we do the mountain next door though
they were leaving our fireworks last night which is annoying
we have an initial haul in the fifth of the new green bus I don't fall but lots of people
in fireworks they hold it they can be that often easy oh my machine's slowing down
I got a little laser laptop it's a netbook type thing it's actually a trouble mate
just looking at aces but I don't know I think I'd rather get HP I like to shivers and I like the
HPs but I want to get in tell I'm not really interested nowadays oh the saga of buying this thing
this is the only laptop that is available well there's one laptop by Dell
and they have a top of the range model that's a four or five grand that's available with Linux
you know it's a lot for me I know we don't have that much money
you can get some like last year's models for around the eight nine hundred mark
they're normally the four-dram with a low processor but watching machine going a bit
girl you can't hear that but I think I prefer to I want to HU laptop and I want something
with the high-end processor so if you're having a low
rather speed the whole one thousand bucks then they actually buy a speed 700 bucks and get cheap
you know get one it's not going to do me for you yeah no money for a living hundred which is
quite nice which is eight got eight year RAM and it's her HP she's got some nice ones too but
non-touch the touch stuff is coming and it's like it's like two green here by touch
so well that game really all the old models I'm just worried if I leave it too long I leave it
another 12 months I'm going to miss out on all the all the non-touch laptops you won't be any
laptop non-touch laptop's room so I'm just trying to get the deals when they actually come in
it's just top speeds of here like we're looking at seven hundred bucks for i3 if you're talking
until i3 a laptop like it's just like I can't see the point I'll have a non-touch you know i7
and get actually RAM it's pretty yeah yeah no I don't use touch anyway why would I want it I've
spent all my life going don't touch the screen don't touch the screen and if somebody touches it
get my spray out and clean it and all people are touching the screen all the time it's just that
always me um would you guys recommend getting something with a video card I don't know if I'm
getting it intel is a huge difference or not like um intel graphics aren't too bad is it
I am the last person to um ask my search criteria was it must come without an operation system
or wood linux or bsg or some free operation system yes now i did down to two laptops so that was
that what do you want to do with your laptop pretty much this video we did think and next
stuff and not game I'm saying not too much right not not not the big get big stuff okay before you
answer that we will um in two minutes we'll be doing the new tonsil so brace brace brace
to Ken Fallon just cut me off no but I will go ahead don't say if you're not doing any serious
gaming or um maybe 3d graphics rendering blender type stuff you could probably I mean intel
card is just fine I mean I have an intel card in mind I do some gaming but if you want like
cutting edge steam you know borderlands two gaming you probably want an Nvidia card
I say borderlands two is a must I have to have it and if you want to keep your Linux experience
pain free of having to fight with some distros installing Nvidia you should probably have
you know in a void Nvidia yeah that's what I'm thinking I'll say I've got another yeah g2
10 and it's annoying on when do you stop with some um deviants in some match bestest drove
what pain have you experienced within video recently
well Dan Dan I haven't had any but I know some people have problems installing Linux
distros and we'll just get rid of the smallest thing it's a low-end yeah it's just 600 and the
two tens that people have traveled with probably that it's well it's helped by where he's called
has been having huge issues and he just to follow me on operating systems I use
and we had the same problems all the time the only problem I had was I had to use the
proprietary drivers instead of the free ones it's what I used the priority was did you have a
newer cart paywall no but uh we we talked about this until it's remember and we
