Oh, this is my bill and I'm here with Cody Cooper.
Yes, that's great.
Good.
I made it again.
I made it again.
Second year in a row.
We were just talking.
It's a bit of a haul for you to get here.
Yeah.
I fly in from Portland, Oregon every year.
So the left coast.
The left coast.
It's a commitment, man.
It is.
But it's worth it.
I love the fest.
I mean, a lot of...
Well, coming out here, instead of just going to fest in my local area, I met a lot
of good people that I've been conversing with online for years.
Yeah, that's so.
It's always good to get out and meet the community in person if you have the ability to.
And luckily, I do.
That's exactly why I come to these.
Like, I talked to you guys online.
You never meet face-to-face.
This is a good excuse to say, you know, hello and...
Oh, yeah.
So you're...
You're going to be involved in a talk today?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'll be on the Ask the Geek panel with Stephen Glockland, Chad Mullenberg and Martin Obando
and will be hosted by Russ Winter, the Tekken Geek, be a good time.
Nice.
You want to plug the show?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm a co-host of Linux to the rest of us, which is on the podcast network.
I co-host it with Stephen Glockland, aka the door-door geek.
Every week, we release a show.
We talk about all sorts of Linux news tips, any sort of upcoming software hardware that
kind of catches our attention.
We do interviews.
It's been...
We're about 160 episodes deep, so a good, good long-standing show.
I'm the second co-host that's come on.
We have a blast every week, and then, of course, just check out podnets.com.
We have a bunch of other great shows right now, and a lot of good stuff in the works coming
up real soon.
Very cool.
Good to talk to you again.
You too, Bill.
Take care.
So this is really cool.
Bill and I are bouncing back and forth.
Bill's trying to make a competition out of this, and he's no fair, because I'm really
sleepy.
But he's got at least four interviews, and I think I'm only got two at this point.
But something that he also adjusted, and I want to give him props for, he got X-Eleven
0-1, not only to commit to recording an HPR episode, but he's going to do it right here
on Bill's laptop, where he's got a cool microphone stand set up, and Audacity's already
open for him.
And X-Eleven 0-1, you are the man.
Thanks.
I've been meaning to do a obligatory, how I got into Linux episode, for pretty much
since I heard the first one, and started listening to HPR a year ago, nine months ago, something
like that.
I keep feeling like I owe an episode to the community, and I keep making excuses, and I got
here and Bill sat me down in front of this computer and said, you don't have excuses anymore.
Do it.
And now we're a little nicer than that, but.
And now we're all looking forward to it.
So thanks a bunch, man.
Yeah.
I look forward to it.
I had nothing to do with the punch in the arm.
No.
Oh.
What?
Hello.
This is my Bill.
And I'm here with Mrs.
I write Bill.
And I just stepped under.
What is this for?
You're at.
You're at.
You're at.
You're at nothing.
Yeah.
How are you liking it?
It's okay.
I'm being honest.
Yeah.
It's not for you this year?
Well.
Last year you enjoyed it.
You got some good talks.
Yeah.
It has pretty good talks this year too, but it is a little bit too small, I think.
It's too small this year?
Well, they kept running other venues, kept selling them down, and I was just talking to Bruce
about it.
And people would say, okay, and then all of a sudden at the last minute, charged
night double.
I know.
I know.
I feel better about all those people who organized these things.
They didn't turn out very nice.
I mean, it's expected, so.
But it sounds like now they realize they're going to have to look for a permanent home,
so.
Oh, really?
You'll come back next year if they have a permanent home?
That will be very nice, because they actually bring good speakers, so.
Thank you for talking.
So what's the score now?
I don't know.
This might be three for me.
Hey, everybody.
It's Pokey at Northeast Linux Fest again, and I am here with Langdon White.
Langdon White.
Nice to meet you Langdon.
And you're here with Red Hat, is that correct?
Yep.
And what's Red Hat doing here today?
Well, you know, obviously pretty invested in Linux.
And so, you know, when actually our biggest engineering office in North America is in Westford,
which is about 45 miles from Boston.
And, you know, when there's something, you know, Linux related this close by, you know,
we'd be kind of remiss not to be involved.
So, you know, we normally sponsor this event.
And we actually have a bunch of speakers here as well.
So that's why we're here.
Excellent, excellent.
And are you trying to bring in users or developers?
Are you looking to hire all of the above?
Yeah, all the above.
I mean, you know, I think we're always looking to hire particularly from this community, you know,
because that's where a lot of our people come from.
And it's always interesting.
You know, as far as users are concerned, I mean, I think we, you know,
we appreciate users, but it's more, you know, we expect enterprises really buying our products
rather than, you know, kind of consumer level stuff.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be here handing out hats, you know.
And, you know, we like people to know who we are.
And also, we like people to know that we do more than Linux.
You know, we also do J-Boss and Cluster and OpenShift,
which is platform as a service available online.
And we're really heavily involved in OpenStack,
which is kind of some of the next gen, kind of, you know,
running ISPs and that kind of stuff.
So that's why we're here.
And they will say these hats are killer.
These are awesome beanies you're handing out here today with the red banner on the bottom.
Red Hat logo on them. Those are killer.
And so do you work for Red Hat or are you a community member?
No, I actually work for Red Hat.
I'm a developer advocate or developer evangelist.
So I talk to developers about working on Linux, you know,
and particularly our Linux.
And I try to bring back their complaints and compliments to the engineering team
and see what we can do differently or better to make it a better development platform.
One of the big things that we launched in the past couple of years
is we had this thing called the developer tool set.
And Red Hat software collections.
And developer tool set is bringing latest and greatest GCC to REL5 and REL6.
So you don't have to be kind of locked into the tools that get shipped.
Red Hat software collections is similar, but for the, like, the M world.
So, like, you can do Python 3.3 on REL6.
And it's supported and everything else.
But, you know, Python, PHP, Maria, MySQL, Postgres.
We have EngineX out in beta.
We have Node.js.
But basically, there's a sweet spot that we generally play in for the big enterprise
where you want to run something for a million years without changing it.
But we're also recognizing that we want to be able to ship, you know,
an environment for your kind of innovative apps where you want to,
you want to refresh those more regularly.
And you might want to run them on the same hardware.
But you want your platform nice and stable.
Exactly.
So now we're shipping kind of stuff that only has a three-year life cycle
because you expect that you're going to rebuild it that regularly.
So you want to, you know, and most people do this already, right?
You pick four particular apps.
You pick kind of its lifespan.
And now you have another option for that tool chain,
rather than having to use the stuff that is native as your only choice.
Now you can also choose to use these things called software collections,
which will give you what we like to call it is, you know, latest stable.
So it's not bleeding edge, but it's the stuff that most people are adopting, right?
So we have no JS10, right?
It's a pretty solid product.
You know, it's still young, but it's way more solid than it was
and a lot of people are gravitating towards it.
You know, we have Python 3.3.
You know, people are finally committing to Python 3 series.
And 3.3 seems to be what they're committing to.
You know, similar with Python 2.7.
You know, it's like, you know, people get off 2.6 and now they're, you know, really in 2.7.
Ruby 193 was the same way.
And Ruby 2, we just started shipping.
So yeah, that's kind of the idea is we're trying to look at the community
and know what people are really gravitating towards,
and then try to ship that one, rather than, you know, whatever is right off trunk, you know.
Excellent. Excellent.
How long have you worked for Red Hat?
Actually, two years, just a few days ago.
So, yeah.
You look like a pretty happy guy that must treat you nice.
Yeah, it's good.
You know, it's a bit of a hike because I live in downtown Boston.
But other than that, it's pretty good.
And I travel around and talk to people about development, and that's fun.
That commute's got to be easier in the lane with no traffic in it, though.
Yeah, well, we actually run a bus out of LWIF.
So I often do that.
So I take the red line up to LWIF and then take the bus out to the office.
So I don't have to drive.
Oh, good thinking, good thinking.
How are you liking the fest so far?
It's good.
You know, I didn't get to go to a talk, of course, because I'm stuck in the room, you know,
kind of watching the booth.
But, you know, a lot of people are interesting.
Are you the only one watching the booth?
Are you here alone?
I am right now because everybody wanted to go to Rick's talk.
Right.
Yeah.
Is there any talk you're looking forward to seeing?
Are you going to make somebody man the booth for you?
Well, I also wanted to see Rick's talk.
But I actually have to take off early, because I have to go coach a kid soccer game.
So I drew the short straw.
Oh, right on.
Okay.
Well, is there anything else you wanted to plug or anything personally you want to talk about?
No, I thought, actually, you know, I would have gone to all the talks.
I mean, honestly, you know, I really like to meet Rick's talks about, particularly his,
because I was a web developer, right?
So I'm not a Linux developer guy, right?
I've used Linux for years and years.
But I've always been, like, kind of further up the stack.
And the stuff he's doing with kind of IPA and basically providing identity management to Webstacks.
You know, as I joke around with somebody is like, you know, every single time you write an application,
you have to write an employee table.
IPA makes it so you don't have to do that, which is kind of nice.
So I like his stuff.
I like Rick's stuff, because it's so far over my head.
It's kind of awesome.
And then there was something else I wanted to see too, but I don't remember what now.
So, you know, there's good stuff.
You know, it seems like a good lineup.
Yeah, I think usually Northeast Linux Fest itself records all the talks and hosts them.
So, at least you really get the recordings of them.
Right, so I'll probably go back and watch them.
Rick's I've actually seen before, because he gave a similar talk at FOSM.
And so I was there and saw at least half of it then.
Yeah, and for anyone listening to this episode, we'll make sure to get that in the show notes
where we can find all these talks once they're posted.
And the only other thing I would plug is we have our developer conference in San Francisco.
We kept her next.
It's a little late notice, but it's called Dev Nation.
So even if you can't make it this year, you know, check it out for next year.
It's kind of the combination of all of our developer conferences, you know, versus Summit,
which is really about our products and about SIS admins.
You know, we've kind of created a conference that's directly about developers wanting to use our products as developers.
And you check out the schedule, it's insane.
It's just all over the place.
And, you know, our joke is we didn't take any talk that was less than a level three in difficulty.
You know, on a scale of one to five.
Cool.
Yeah, so I think it's really neat.
Do you have a URL for that?
Devination.org.
Excellent. Thanks a lot.
Yeah.
Thanks for your time.
No problem.
Hello.
Well, we can, you can type it too.
Hello, Ken.
Hello, everybody.
You're listening to Ken Thalon live from behind this computer trying to work out what is going on with the
huge government system.
How is everybody doing over there?
I can't hear you.
We are talking, Ken.
I can't hear you.
We don't have a cable for that.
No, seriously.
I can't hear you.
Kia.
Hello.
How about now, Ken?
Oh, shit.
I'm muted.
Oh, so he didn't catch me plugging in either.
Hey, Ken, how about now?
Yep.
Can hear you now.
Right on.
Hey.
We can do an interview.
Let me see.
Yeah, we can interview you live from the Northeast Linux Fest.
Oh, this is NY Bill.
Let's do it.
Hey, this is Hokey and NY Bill and X11X1101.
And we're interviewing Ken Thalon, who's not going to be able to do it.
Yeah, we can interview you live from the Northeast Linux Fest.
Oh, this is NY Bill.
Let's do it.
Hey, this is Hokey and NY Bill and X11X1101.
And we're interviewing Ken Thalon, who's not at the Northeast Linux Fest.
But by the magic of the alternate, he's here overmumble.
Intercontinental interview.
Hi, everyone.
How's it going?
We're having fun, man.
We're getting interviews and pictures and all kinds of HDR content.
How about you?
I am fighting the website, trying to get the commenting system working.
But other than that, preparing for the community news.
As has been said, many, many times by probably only me.
We need a forum, man.
Actually, I've never heard that before.
Any excuse to get rid of this commenting system?
A number out there.
Kia.
I've been using Linux Outloads guys have been using discourse lately.
And I have to say it is pretty nice.
It could be something to look into.
And so were the guys over at Bad Voltage.
They were actually the first one I used.
And it's really, really nice.
Yeah, check out this course.
It's like kind of, it's a forum.
2.0.
It's less bad than a forum.
Yeah, I heard the interview on the, they were on twice on.
Crossweekly.
But unfortunately, we call this novel.
Oh, that's that.
We didn't know that.
Okay.
I didn't know that.
I thought it was.
If, if it's not, then that's, yeah, that's a definitely a big downer.
The deal killer, we call it.
Deal breaker.
Oh, no, no, check that.
Because you can never trust an Irish guy.
I resemble that remark.
I trust you as far as I can throw you.
Hey, we're in Boston, man.
This is the only place you can trust Irish.
This is all Irish.
Yes.
Well, not Irish Irish.
Like, it's hardcore as you are, but.
The fight in the Irish.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Chad.
How's it going over there?
It's going pretty good, man.
We got interviews from all kinds of people who show it up.
We got Paul here too from Paul.com.
I got his and he's holding his hand up across the pictures.
They're going up as I take them.
Yeah.
And I'm sitting here.
Excellent.
And I'm sitting here live recording my first episode.
Yeah, it's right.
Well done.
And editing.
He's editing on our table live during the fest.
It's, it's wicked fun.
And Bill's recording this.
This will be on the recording.
And this course is 100% open source.
Next generation discussion platform built for the next decade of the internet.
Well, I do apologize to everybody out there.
Apology accepted.
And what would an HBR episode be without a gene apology?
There you go.
There's nothing wrong with being wrong.
There's nothing wrong with being wrong.
There's nothing wrong with being wrong.
As long as you can.
As long as you're big enough to admit it and say, hey, you know,
I wasn't quite right there.
Here's the truth.
Yeah, I do it so very well.
I think I'm going to leave my mic open because I keep missing the first part of what people are saying on you.
Yeah, there we go.
And I do also want to check and see if Bill's got a nice stand mic.
I want to see if that thing's able to, uh, to record.
So I can give X 1101 this cable back.
I left my cable in the car, but I'll probably walk and get it.
Hey, it's Chad Wallenberg.
Tell me.
This is what I, that stand mic is what I use to record mine.
I was through Audacity, but it's just, uh, it looks like it's just,
I'm afraid to unplug it while I sit here.
Yeah, I don't tell them that sort of thing.
Audacity is so flaky.
Yeah.
He's saying, he's up to the editing part and he's saying he doesn't like the sound of his voice,
but we are going to twist his arm and he will put it out.
Oh, I already was on a live episode or one of your guys's interviews.
Both of you actually saying I was going to do it.
So yeah, you're committed to it.
At this point, I've made a promise and I'm not going to back down from that.
Now we just be bad for him.
Yes, that will get you off on the list.
I hope that we keep this.
You'd love it, Ken.
There's a lot of community going on here.
Excellent.
I traveled three hours to get here and haven't been to a talk yet.
I've been doing the hallway track.
Yep.
We're out here yet.
Nice venue, too.
We got, uh, got our own room here.
The tables are a bit bigger than I was expected.
There's actually, they've actually got three rooms.
You are on.
We're recording.
Thank you, Chad.
We're not editing that out.
That's copyrighted music, Chad.
That was less than 10 seconds.
You can't copyright Chad.
This song was infringed by Chad Wallenberg.
Of the Linux basement.
The ten-second room.
The ten-second room only applies to the U.S.
We're an international park.
Right on.
Well, I don't know anything about internet access.
I don't know anything about internet access.
I don't know anything about internet access.
Right on.
Well, I don't know anything about international copyright as well.
What time is the, um, community show going to start, Ken?
Thinking about a half an hour.
Half an hour, all right.
I'm a new.
I think I'm going to run and go get my own, uh, cables so I'm not stealing
anybody's or getting things mixed up.
So I'll step away, guys.
Oh, wow.
We've done your runji.
I think we're going to lunch.
Lunch.
Whoa.
I can only have lunch.
You want to go to lunch, Ken?
I'd love to.
We'll save you a plane.
Are you planning on dialing in for the community news show?
We're getting interviews, but are you going to go?
Yeah, I'm dialed in now.
That's what this is for.
Oh, yeah, we'll come in chat a bit, OK?
OK, well then we'll start whenever you get back from lunch.
Cool.
OK.
Thanks, Ken.
Do you know?
Do you?
Hey, Pokey at Nelf again.
And I am here with Paul, right, from Paul.com.
Actually, it's kind of a funny story.
We're actually not called Paul.com anymore.
We changed our name to Security Weekly.
And the story of how we had to change our name
is happening next week at Sort of Boston,
where we're given a talk on hacking the trademark system.
So I didn't actually hack the trademark system,
but someone else kind of did.
And it was interesting to learn how all that happened.
So we're called Paul's Security Weekly's
the name of the show.
Security Weekly is the umbrella for our internet TV podcasts.
We do a weekly episode that's five minutes called HackNaked TV.
So that's what we're doing, free internet TV and podcast
on computer security and hacking.
Excellent, excellent.
Now, how long have you been at it?
A little over eight years.
So we started it in 2005, and we've done pretty much
a weekly show, maybe 48 or 50 episodes a year since then.
Are you making a living at this?
No, it's not my full-time job.
It's a pretty hefty side business now.
There's probably at least four or five employees part time
and then a bunch of hosts that participate.
We have a studio now, 11 on Square feet,
just out here in Rhode Island, where we're doing,
actually we're doing two shows.
We do Security Weekly, and I started up a cigar podcast too.
So both of those are now in the studio.
Which happens to be next to a cigar lounge conveniently, you know?
To me, so yeah, it's great.
Yeah, a full-time I work for Tenable Network Security
and the product evangelist
for the Nestus vulnerability scanner primarily.
Okay, right on.
And so, but you're making money at podcasting?
Yeah, so it's kind of funny right now.
We have a full boat of advertisers on Security Weekly.
I physically can't take on any more advertisers right now,
until we add some more people to help support them.
So yeah, you know, we're not, it's not making a living,
but it's enough to keep the show going
and they really help us push that next level.
We want HD cameras, we want video signatures.
Yesterday in our studio, we were a contractor came
and built some sets for us.
We have a Cedar panel set in the background.
We want to get furniture.
So it's really just a kind of fun to our hobby
to be able to do really cool interviews
and do our own TV show.
Because it's fun.
Nice, a lot of guys have trouble just getting to where
they can pay for hosting.
It's a very impressive.
Yeah, I love adding all the equipment and doing all that stuff.
It's so much fun.
Yeah, we get all the geek toys to play around with.
And it's just cool to be able to hack together
your own TV show, you know?
Like the big networks do it and look at things
like the tonight show or the voice is like an example
of probably the most expensive TV show to produce.
And I'm like, how can we replicate that
and spend a fraction of the money on it?
So it's a lot fun.
What some tips and tricks you've learned recently
that you're still excited about?
Yeah, so the best tip that doesn't cost a lot of money at all
is on Amazon.
You can buy really inexpensive lighting and backdrops.
So like I went on Amazon and searched
with some of the inexpensive lighting
and it's like $100 or less for a kit of lights
that comes with all the bulbs and stands and everything.
And then the backdrops are around $50 for a whole bunch
of backdrops.
Just that setup alone that costs a few hundred dollars
makes your video look so much more professional.
Even when some of our cameras that aren't as great,
that whole setup looks so much better
with the right lighting.
And now lighting and even cameras and equipment
have come down so far in price.
When we started in 2005, everything was really expensive.
You can get a video switcher for $900.
And it does a lot of the things that the professional ones
that cost $20,000 do.
That wasn't available before.
And now it is and enables us to have our own shows.
Are you leaving Amazon reviews so people can find
this stuff easily?
I'm not, but I will.
And I should create a page and tell people what we bought
so that they can replicate it as well.
Because I think I found some real gems on Amazon.
And you're right, we need to make a bigger deal about that.
It's fun when you find that diamond in the rough piece
of hardware.
Yeah, exactly.
The camera we bought was expensive,
but it allows us to do mobile interviews now.
So we use the Canon X810 to do our remote interviews.
And we use it on the show.
We travel to both cigar events and security
and Linux, general computer conferences as well.
We do interviews and we record footage in that camera.
Camera recommended from the guys who are at HAC5.
They've got a great show and a documentary filmmaker
that's done some documentaries in the hacking realm.
He made this film called 2600.
It was a hacker documentary, Jeremy Zarakak.
They both said, dude, this is the camera for you.
That's going on my list of things to watch too.
We saved up some budget and it's been an outstanding
to be able to do what we couldn't do before for a little more
investment and just let us create more content.
Awesome, awesome.
And you give a talk today?
I'm giving a talk today at four.
It's on embedded device security.
I've given a lot of talks on embedded device security.
So the one that makes this one different is,
I'm going to talk about a really interesting, cool
and unique vulnerabilities on this particular firmware
that went across multiple D-Link routers.
There are at least two or three different researchers
that have discovered vulnerabilities, written shell code
for the platform.
And I'm kind of piecing all that together
to talk about basically everything that you should never do
when you're designing an embedded device for security.
Is this a stock firmware?
Is it something that people are hacking on there?
So this is a stock firmware from D-Link.
I believe it is the Linux-based firmware
that they're using on there.
There is some source code available.
A lot of guys have reverse engineered it.
But that's just half the talk.
The other half of the talk is I'm going to talk about 10 things
that developers and embedded device manufacturers
can do so that their devices aren't so horribly secure.
So we talk about the vulnerabilities, the impacts,
but also I'm kind of championing this thing this year
to say, hey, let's be better across everything that's
in our refrigerator all the way to running our power plants,
please, to your insulin pumps that are attached to people.
Let's be better.
And here are 10 things that you can do to be better.
Yeah, not all those things are terribly difficult, are they?
No, it's like simple things.
Don't embed a back door inside the firmware.
And I'll talk today about what I think
is one of the coolest back doors ever that has been embedded
inside of an embedded device.
It's called Joel's Back Door.
And the story involves Russians,
it involves user agent strings, and just really cool stuff.
Wow, neat, neat.
How are you liking the Fest so far?
Oh, it's awesome.
I love coming out to events and talking to people.
We're here with our hack-naked shirts, which
is a lot of fun, and it's been great so far.
Now, I don't remember seeing this as your first
Northeast Linux Fest?
Yeah, this is the first time that we've been here.
It was an easy drive for us.
So Jonathan invited us out, and I'm happy that he did.
Cool, cool.
And are there any talks you're looking forward to or anything
about it that's?
Every time I try and go to a talk,
someone catches my ear and I end up talking to people,
which I'm totally fine with.
The hallways track.
Yeah, it's the hallway track for me at most shows, which is great.
I mean, this is my opportunity to come talk to people
that listen to our show and talk to people
that don't know about our show and kind of give them
the pitch that we're here.
This is my fourth one, I think I've seen one talk.
Yeah, ever.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
Yep, and I just catch them online afterwards.
Exactly, they're what I get fun.
So is there anything else that I should be asking you about?
Or you'd like to plug or anything?
No, just my talk next week at Source Boston,
which is going to be a lot of fun.
And we'll also be at DefCon this year.
I'm really excited about that.
That's another great one where I don't get to see any talks,
but there's 15,000 hackers that converge.
So that's a lot of fun, too.
I want to make the community aware that what a fun event
that is out in Vegas in August this year.
Excellent, excellent.
One more time, what's the URL?
Securityweekly.com.
All right, thanks a lot.
Thank you.
I'm going to rope you into an HPR.
And okay, right now.
Okay, yeah, yeah, let's give it a shot.
All right, so, okay.
We're at a party, like it's like we're in high school
or something.
We're having drinking beers now.
We're telling it.
You were asking about HPR, and you might put up,
you have some good ideas for episodes.
Yes, yes.
So what tons of ideas.
What name should we look for?
We see episodes from you.
We're going to look for Joe Mapros.
Joe Mapros?
Yes.
Do we have to roll that?
Yes, that is correct.
You're going to say them are pros, all right?
I think we can do it.
It's an African concept.
Okay, yes, yes.
Mapros is almost like a reference of a computer sort of guy.
Okay, good, good, yes.
Yes, yeah.
And you just took the exam of the LPEG,
the Lennox Professional Institute.
Very cool.
This would fit right in with an HPR.
Yes, yes.
Well, the test is not to be taken lightly.
I took it lightly for the first time.
Yeah, you go through the man pages.
You go through the objectives.
And then you go in the exam and say, oh my God, I didn't make it.
We kind of talked a bit earlier, like, yeah.
We can be a bit cocky going into an exam or something.
I think we know everything about that is correct.
And then boom, boom, boom, yes, yes.
Yeah, I was like that.
Get it closer.
Yeah, that's how I say your nick.
You don't have one.
You don't have a nick?
No.
I'm going to give you one if you don't have one.
Okay.
Now that's fine, that's fine.
Oh, yeah.
So yeah, I went in there thinking it's going to be a piece of cake.
Don't worry about it.
Day before I looked through man pages, looked at the objectives.
No problem.
But in the actual exam, you're going to go in there and I know this.
But I kind of, okay, I forgot.
But then you give the wrong answer.
Yes, yes.
You know.
Answer many exams.
Yes.
It's like getting the sweaty palms.
Yes, yes, yes.
So, but I took the second time around.
It gives you a pride because I tell you you have the,
when you fail the first instance, you have to take it again after seven days.
So after seven days from when you get out of there with the disappointment,
oh my god, I didn't make it.
And my girlfriend stuck by me and the disappointment was, oh, how did it go?
Oh, I kind of didn't make it.
No, no, no.
Next time, she stuck by me and I said, okay, seven days later, it's okay.
I'm going to show them.
So, yeah, the trials and tribulations, the pitfalls you might have had that this is
very good.
This would be a good episode.
Yes, some of the trials and tribulations is number one, never undermine the exam.
It's a big deal.
Yeah, number two is, you know, you've got to prepare, run somewhere, or everything on the
objectives.
You've got to go through.
All right, all the commands they're looking for and stuff like that.
Just run them out with, run all the, everything they're asking for.
You've got to go through all the man pages, you've got to try all the examples, everything.
Now, I haven't, oh, you got one.
He's got one.
I'll show you what I got.
I'll show you, let's see if I can find this.
So I haven't taken this.
What type of like literature do they give you beforehand?
Well, basically, they give you objectives.
It sounds like they give you a literature and an objective and then you've got the test,
they threw you a curve.
Yes, pretty much.
So, basically, it's distribution neutral, so when you go in there, they ask you Debian
question.
Yeah, I'm a Debian guy.
Yes, yes, yes.
You must be some Red Hat or R&M stuff, I'd be lost.
Right.
And in the Debian portion of it, they go into details like up, get all that stuff.
Yeah.
So, together we could have done it, I could have done the up, get stuff, and you could
have done the what?
Right.
Right, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You could do the yum stuff.
Yes.
Yum and RPMs and stuff like that, and there was another question that threw me off about
compiling, you know, you can convert RPMs to Debian and vice versa, alien, yes, yes,
yes, I know it.
I knew that.
But I kind of was like, oh, when you look at the objectives, you don't pay too much
attention.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I've got an exam time.
They were going into details like, all right, there was a question that threw me off about
I think they do it on purpose, they're trying to read out who can do it under pressure.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
About RPM queries.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
RPM queries and the options that give you, you know, off the, there's a Linux guy.
On top of your head, you think, well, you're curing a package, you look it into option queue
and stuff like that.
They went into more detail, like going right into every switch and every switch and stuff
like that, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
This would make a good HPR if you could give people a little bit of a warning about what's
coming up.
Yes.
Yes.
When we were talking earlier, you have another interesting thing.
Somehow you got Fedora on a service?
Yes.
Microsoft Surface.
Yes.
How did you get around EUFI?
Well, there's several techniques you have to, I looked at a few YouTube videos, there's
a guy on there that shows you the whole process of how to bypass the, uh, you, you, E-F-I.
What they call it, right?
I don't know, EUFI or it's, it's, it's, it's, we're close, it's got to be, we had a few
beers, so it's got to be one of those.
