Hello, my name is Ken Fallon and I'm calling in a summer short here on Hacker Public
Radio.org. My tip today is on how you can grep the tab in a file. On the command line you can type
grep space double quotes, then holding down the control and pressing the V key, then you can press
tab and close your double quotes space and then the name of the file or files that you want to search.
This allows you to specify the actual tab character which normally would be interpreted by
bash and be used to do tab completion. I've found this very useful and I'll include a link to the
website where I found this out in the show notes for this episode. That is the end of the summer short,
which is a series on HPR of short, Twitter like audio updates. Feel free to do record one
yourself. You don't need to edit them, you don't need to add the intro or outro, simply record
something. Email us to adminathackerpublicradio.org and we'll do the rest. I look forward to hearing your
show soon. Thank you and goodbye.
