This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3653 for Wednesday the 3rd of August 2022.
Today's show is entitled, Hello HPR Community.
It is the first show by Newhost Stack of F. It carries a clean flag.
The summary is, Introducing Myself to the HPR Community.
Hello Hacker Public Radio.
My name is Stash AF and this is my self introductory episode.
In the community news for June, the janitors discussed how to pronounce my handle.
It is, in fact, pronounced stash as in mustache.
It was my aircrew call sign when I was in the Air Force, hence the AF at the end.
I wanted to introduce myself before I start tormenting all of you with some of my ramblings,
with some of the projects that I am currently working on, things like custom firmware for
my Ender 3 3D printer and various other interests.
But for now, I am just going to say hello to the rest of the community and I look forward
to sharing these projects of mine.
Thanks, bye.
