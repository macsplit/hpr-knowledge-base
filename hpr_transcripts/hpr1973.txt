Hi everybody, my name is Ken Falling and you're listening to another episode of Hacker
Public Radio.
Today's show is a recording of a presentation that Richard Stallman gave at a pre-show
to foster them 2016.
We're putting it out here under some restricted conditions, namely it is released under
Creative Commons by Attribution No Derivative Work License.
The reason for that are explained in the show and in addition to that there is no copy
of this on the MP3 feed as Richard doesn't want to promote non-free software.
The reason for the No Derivatives is that this is his opinions and as such you're entitled
to listen to it and record your own show but he's also entitled to his own opinions, short
synopsis of that.
If you want to listen to it this part will be released on the MP3 feed so if you want
to listen to the show you can go to point your browser over at the main website and you
should be able to listen to it there or download VLC and listen to the org version.
In any event this is a good opportunity to switch to the org feed, most of our people are
listening on org.
If that's too much work for you you can also listen to it on the archive.org where we put
the original source flag and web file and you can download that there and I think they
also do free and non-free derivatives but that's outside of our control.
So with that sit back relax and enjoy the show or if you're listening on the MP3 feed
you're desperately scrambling around to find a copy of this that you can listen to.
In either event I hope you enjoy the show and tune in tomorrow for another exciting
episode of Hacker Public Radio.
