This is HPR Community News, an update for the month of March 2011.
Hello everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and this is a community update for March 2011 where
we give you a behind-the-scenes look at some of the goings-on on the HPR mailing list
and what's been happening on the website.
There's a lot of things been going on with the relation to the Indiana Linux Fest and I'm leaving
it up to the other hopes to come on and describe what went on over there. I'm just very, very sorry
I missed it and I hope everybody had a great time. Okay, let's start by welcoming three new hosts
in the network and there were Marcosi, Mr Gadgets and Mrs Zook. They're all very welcome onto the HPR
network. This month we've had three people join up and what I fear is that in the last few
months we've had a lot of people join the network and those were people who were simmering on the
teetering on the edge and all that the need was a little push from myself or others to get them
to come on and record a show. So my target as you all know is to get every single person who
listens to this network to record one show a year and we would have more than enough shows.
So if you already haven't recorded a show, you owe me one or at least you need to contribute to
the HPR in some way or other. Well, it would be nice if you did. So doing a show review after
last month's behind the scenes at HPR, we had Lost and Bronx who had show theaters of the
Imagination Park 2 where he is looking into a Renaissance revival of all-time radio shows,
dramatic audio media. If any of you picked up my recommendation last month for listening to his
to his own show, I think you'll give him a lot more credit than he gives himself for his
ability to put on this art form. Then we had the next day a well-known member of the community,
but first time first time show host Mrs. Zook coming home with her series Terminally Stupid
Episode 1 in her quest to find people who are terminally stupid. Now I have to admit when I first
heard this episode I.D. uploaded. Of course, I will put it up following the same rules that
everything else that every other show does. It's on your fair. I thought, well, I'm of the view
that everybody, there's no such thing as a stupid person and that everybody has the ability to
learn and improve themselves. However, after listening to three of these shows, now
they're quite tongue-in-cheek and I think Mrs. Zook is well on the way to reform me of that
particular view of the world. The following show was a little bit of Python Episode 14 and
following on from that we had Brum with another excellent auction yard sales and flea markets,
which we would here call car boot sales. I really like this whole green thing theme and thank you
very much Brum for giving in that show and I hope you produced some more. Then we had Mr. Gadgets
with my first computer and two things to be said from about this. One was obviously the first
was that he had heard about the call-in number and this was our first podcast on the call-in line
so I was messing about trying to come up with a workflow in which we could add the intro and
outro to that and by accident I uploaded one of my initial shows which I called and was out
live for about five minutes and then I replaced it but unfortunately in the intervening time there was
it was indexed by iTunes and quite a lot of people on iTunes reported problems playing that
episode so rectify that and if you haven't listened to episodes 681 and you listen to iTunes
could you please just reload that episode and it should come down again. The following day we had
episode 682, Pokey talking about the Northeast Linux Fest and taxes and yes very very apt for
this time of year and there were a few comments in the show notes about people who had other
links and resources that they could give then we had the xorg google summer of code called for
students appeal where they marcosi sent in a podcast detailing what x.org is and summer of code ideas
and yeah it's really great that's that sort of appeal will come on here in a really hope one of
our listeners will take take advantage of that and if you do if you are applying to that drop us
a line and we'll make sure that you get some hpr stickers. The following day was ebb and
morganon freedom in the cloud on syndicated Thursday it happened to be same Patrick's day so I
threw in an Irish greeting there and hello to all the people in Ireland who listened to this
network which is really great to hear please feel free to send in some episodes and more
listeners that I know about if I know about you then you own me an episode and and again this was a
it was quite a long one it has to be said I added the intro and outro to the episode and I also added
a brief introduction and I joined up to podcast the speech itself and the
language at the end unfortunately the levels were a bit off so I apologize to
to anybody who is upset about this but I didn't really want to do a reencode
any more reencoding I'm just trying to get the levels correct as I say I'm an amateur at this
game and there's still a lot to learn so don't be afraid I continually make mistakes here so don't
be worried about audio quality or our point here is to get out the message as quickly as possible
and we do strive for perfection I obviously don't want to send out crap audio but at the same time
I want to get the shows out as well so the following day we had riddle box doing a product review
of a Sunvolt which is a battery charger ideal for mobile devices portable USB devices
Mrs. Okigama terminally stupid and there are links to her blog directly on the
on the show notes on the webpage then we have Mr. Gadgets with his pre-IBM computer history
and these are gathering a lot of comments and I am actually amazed to hear his ability to
to go ahead and just pick up the phone start talking without humming and all the whole way through
a coherent story and a coherent speech that absolutely the man has gifted it has to be said
so yes I am an all of people who can do that the following day we had the HBR book club with
badge of him for me a really really good discussion I like this this format I did listen to the show
to the to the show obviously but also I had read the book or listened to the book beforehand
and I love this really good recommendations if I'm working outside doing something
my normally boring it's great to be able to put on a nice book and listen to it the next
book in the series is Shadow Magic which I have listened to it's by John Lennahan and the book is
on the link to it is on www.polyabooks.com for such title for such Shadow Magic and without
given a lot of way it's a it's a Celtic loosely based on a Celtic
mythological land of Turingonog and I also really enjoy this book as well so much so that
episode 28 came out 28 of 32 and it caught halfway through it was like if somebody had torn out
the last few pages of the chapter I was going ballistic so I was emailing and Facebooking and
on IRC and sending Twitter's out looking for somebody to give me a link because all the links
point back to the same podium books file and I reported a book on it but the three guys Dan
and Integral and Pok√© all sent me links and copies of it so I was able to get my fix in
and finish that book for the night so thanks to those guys then we had a I had sent out a
request on Facebook and Twitter to get submissions for additional ideas for syndicated Thursday
and the guys from EuroTrash allowed me to syndicate their podcast which is cool and they're
going into the schedule I've also had a additional submissions of other podcasts for syndication
but I'm particularly interested in other works as well so one time I've got some one-time
interviews and yeah just of the wall interesting stuff if you could if you come across something
that's creative commons licensed then feel free to send it on in to us then we had Corbondu
with resources for auto dictats I'm not saying that right but he wants to start a new HPR series
I'm all for that hopefully with some improvements on the website you might be able to
launch these these series is a little bit better give them more of a wiki type feel that sort of
thing and it's he's saying he would like if somebody has wants to do a show you can always do
they how I got into start up with Linux show you can do my or my first computer and or what's in
my bag or what's my daily carry and then the third show that you can do is where you get resources
on the net and the net also very very cool I hope I'll be able to contribute to that myself
and then Mr Gadgets with pre IBM computer history as well fascinating journey and I hope
we still have a few more to go or more show with him and I hope it continues to send in material to HPR
then we had Corb Mo with audacity to mess with Satan in which he took three topics that's in
itself wouldn't be long enough to fill a show put them together and hence we had a show i did that's
a while back as well so if you have a few things that tips and tricks don't know if it's like useful
commands or things that you can across in your day feel free to put them together and record a
show i might actually have a few of those myself and then we had Mrs Oak with a terminally stupid
episode um episode three um and then the last show for this one was the full circle podcast uh
the you cubed event by uh an excerpt from full circle podcast and now they those guys have submitted
in a um all series of very well edited segments of what are interesting bits from their show um
I am still considering them uh syndicated show and with that I mean that if if shows have
said that they're going to be syndicated um that they will follow the same rules so for unsindicated
Thursday or whatever when we're putting out syndicated shows we'll still send work on a first
in first out basis never um uh but where there are more shows will uh mix them up so that you don't
have uh content from the same source coming up one after the other so we'll cycle them through
but only they have uh done a absolutely excellent job at editing these uh these shows
and the you cubed event of which they talk about is going to be held on saturday april the second at
10 a.m but more about that and on then um i would like to um have my say of apologies i know i've
already apologized some some people here i'd like to apologize to daviates for apologizing so much
um i'm taking his uh his handle um mr. gadgets of course from messing up his first
episode um to uh dodgy geezer for um the audio intros unsindicated Thursday for an hike up
level right and actually more seriously um to chat to for suggesting last month that he had
abandoned hpour um i actually found out what has happened to um glad to in the intervening time
and i want to do a dedicated segment about that later on in the show um there's a lot of people
to thank this month um uh all the mailing list of people who give me a handout with um
trying to identify what's going wrong with mr. gadgets and localizing your tight tunes

droops for clarifying the hpour uh ownership that hpour owns the mic logo
you know owns the big word but whatever we have actually found a big version png version of that

inescape and once a project to begin on that is uh that is a good one to do i'm also going through the
