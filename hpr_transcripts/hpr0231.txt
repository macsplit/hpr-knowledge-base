don't
Well, I'm driving late night, contemplating life, and the meaning of what's been said.
I see the life liquor over a yield sign, I think of reckless abandonment, and I realize
I don't want to be locked down no more, and I'm ready to go through that door.
So I turn at the next light and blow over the car, look up on the GPS, where's nearest bar, and I wonder what life will bring.
And in my head I begin to say, the next thing you know it, I'm wandering down the road, wondering what the next thing is, and where I should go.
The next thing you know it, my mind begins to race, and all of a sudden my feet pick up the pain.
Because I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.
To make my own decisions.
Now it's the next morning of heated the warning of what I learned last night.
I got the feeling broke through the ceiling of what might be right, and I am so happy that I'm me.
And I found the answer to be free.
The next thing you know it, I'm calling up my friends, I realize the words and the thoughts begin to blend, next thing you know it.
I begin to sing, realizing this world, and what it would bring.
Because I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.
And I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.
To make my own decisions.
To make my own decisions.
