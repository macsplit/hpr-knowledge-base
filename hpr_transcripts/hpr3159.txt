Good day. Good listener of Hacker Public Radio
and welcome to another podcast by me, Paul Quirk.
If you listened to Episode 3000, you would know that I am a supporter of the Creative Commons license.
The very license that Hacker Public Radio podcasts are based upon.
You will also have learned that I am a lover of fine music.
In that episode, we had a sampling of the free Chopin project
and you got to listen to some choice pieces from that collection.
As we are nearing the end of summer, then about to enter autumn.
My mind turns to Vivaldi in the Four Seasons.
I will now read to you the description of the Four Seasons from Muzopen.org.
Antonio Vivaldi composed the Four Seasons in 1723.
It is a set of four violin concertos that propose an early form of descriptive music.
For example, Winter makes prominent use of pizziacto notes in high registers,
whereas summer evokes a storm in its final movement.
The Four Seasons remain very popular to this day.
Some of its concertos spawning a great number of derivative works,
whereas thousands of recordings of the original pieces have been made.
It is still debated if Vivaldi wrote this concertos to accompany the Four Sonnets
that may have been written by himself.
Now, these selections I have chosen were all performed by the Modena Chamber Orchestra
and our performances that have been identified as being free of known restrictions
under copyright law, including all related enabling rights.
You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work,
even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
And so, I will start this podcast with Spring, then Summer, followed by Autumn,
and then Winter uninterrupted.
Enjoy!
