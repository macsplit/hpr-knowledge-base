This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 4,475 for Friday the 26th of September 2025.
Today's show is entitled The True Audio File for Walking Tune Towards A Friend.
It is hosted by Fred Black and is about 22 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is, Fred finally releases the audio file that was supposed to be HBR 4,466 in which they teach a tune.
So, well, I did then goof up and accidentally submitted the wrong audio file.
And, well, this is the audio file I actually want to put up.
The show in question is number 4,466.
And, well, this is the audio that was actually supposed to be submitted.
You might notice that it's actually the thing that was posted is part of what was supposed to be posted.
But, well, just if you thought that my mic was bad now, it will get better.
Just being recorded just on my laptop to be submitted a bit quicker.
Oh, wow. Can it really already have been over a year since I contributed my last regular show?
Well, it's time to record another show.
What do we have? Oh, wait a second.
I remember that I wrote a piece of music like three years ago or something.
It was, it's called Gonglot Tillin-Win, walking tune for a friend or two words of friend.
Well, yeah, I guess it's time that it comes out into the world.
I have had people who liked it for some reason.
I mean, it's way too easy. It's way too simple.
And, it's barely even walking tune. But, I mean, I had to call it something.
But, well, it was originally written on a violin.
But, since my, it just, but since, well, it's a bit hard to teach stuff on the violin.
At least for me, I will be, I will be, of course, teaching it with the help of my likelhopper.
But, I could still just play it for you on my viola.
Because, well, it's a bit more comfortable to play on it.
And it just sounds better than my violin.
Sorry, and so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.

And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
It is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
And so here it is.
Well,
and I don't have been played in the most correct way,
or with a right bow,
because well,
just using my nickel hop a bow for everything. But well, very heavy. It is, I think it is in D major,
but I might be wrong. I have it written down somewhere, but well those, that sheet music might
not be the most accurate one. So, well, here it is, taught from my nickel hop. Okay, as far,
so you need a, the, the, the lowest note is an A, and the highest one I think is a
D, is a D, the octave above. So, so, first the A part.
Okay, there's the A part. Now, to teach it, now, to teach it. So, you start on an A,
the higher one, the octave above the lowest one that you need.
And you go A, G, F, sharp, D, D, A down there, B, A,
and then the same thing, basically, A, G, F, but then you, no, F sharp, then you go E,
then again, A, A, G, F sharp, D, D, A, B, A, C sharp, D, E, D, C sharp.
Got a bit confusing from my side. So, now again, the, the A part taught, A, A, G, F sharp, D, D, A, A, G, F sharp,
D, A, G, F sharp, D, A, A, A, C sharp, D, E, D, C sharp, D.
So, that's the whole A part. Now, again, just played.
So, that's the A part. Now, over to the B part, which
yes indeed, it just, it, it just kind of reminds me of some kind of Irish folk thing,
but sadly, it goes the, the, the re, the note range is a bit awkward for my D-tin whistle. So,
I, I don't really play it on there, but I think it would work. It's just a bit awkward when you
got up words. Well, here's the B part.
Yeah, okay. So, you, so the B part begins on a high D. So, and that goes, let's just go
with D, C sharp, D, B, B, B, A, F sharp, G, A, F sharp, then basically the same thing again,
but different. D, C sharp, D, A, A, A, and then comes a little grace note,
glissando thing, which is, well, it's a bit hard to do on the nickel half, which kind of shows
that the tune was originally written for a, for an instrument without such stupid stuff,
the stuff as frets. Yes, I am, I am still kind of a violin player, because frets are the most
stupid thing ever. So, there you have my opinion on that, but well, basically back, where were we?
Oh yeah, and then you go, then you basically go, then you basically slide more or less from a B flat to B,
or, or well, on the, on the violin, or viola in this case. So, there you have that one.
Then again, this sequence of D, C sharp, D, B, A, F sharp, D, A, F sharp, D, A, D, A,
D, E, D, C sharp, D, F on the whole B part, again. So, D, C sharp, D, A, A, B, F sharp, D, A,
C sharp, D, B, A, A, B flat B, D, C sharp, B, A, F sharp, D, A, F sharp,
D, C sharp, D. So, the whole B part again.
So, there you have the whole tune. I might, maybe I'll do some kind of thing as I did with the Yanta on who's got to go for Yanta on my thing,
but since I don't, but since I haven't written a second voice yet or something that won't be a second voice,
but maybe I'll get forky on this one too, because well, I can also play it on the auto recorder.
So, that's the way we usually play it, with forky on his neck and me on my, also his auto recorder,
although he does really use it that often, so I have kind of occupied it.
So, that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it.
So, that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we play it, so that's the way we usually play it.
So, well, since this episode has been in production for a while, and well, since I wanted forky to get on,
I first had to get him to, I first had to remember to ask him and then get him to actual play,
so since then, I might have learned it well enough on the flute, but since, well, it's not the most optimal,
one for like, where the notes are located, I kind of do octave jumps every now and then,
so I'm just going to play it on the flute.
So, that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it,
so that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it,
so that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it,
so that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it,
so that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way we usually play it,
so that's the way we usually play it, so that's the way.
So thanks for listening. Feel free to comment, critique, whatever. Maybe give me some music
please. Or just, well, respond with a show or a comment. So bye.
