This is HPR Episode 2,700 entitled, Episode 3,000.
It is hosted by Ken Fallon and in about 447 minutes long and carry my clean flag.
The summary is, we commemorate the 300 today with a techie and 2,700 hacker public radio shows.

On the 19th of September 2005 a group of individuals got together to release their first show on the podcast network, today with a techie.
The idea was to share knowledge through podcasting, now 13 years, 2 months, 19 days later the project is still going strong, and you dear listen are a part of it.
Today marks the 2,700 episode of Hacker Public Radio and coupled with the 300 shows from, today with a techie, marks the 3,000 episode of this project.
A big thanks goes out to all 354 individual hosts, who together contributed 1452 hours on shows to the archive.
There is about 50 gigabytes of MP3 files alone, which played back to back gives 60 days 11 hours 40 minutes 21 seconds on continuous play.
If you started listening today and played the shows 24x7 you wouldn't be finished listening until Monday, February 5, 2019.
Of course I meant there would be 39 additional shows released, so you still wouldn't be finished.
Despite all this we still don't have a Wikipedia page.
If you can, please take the time to create one for us.
There is plenty of supporting information in the press section on our about page.
So to mark the 3,000 episode we are going to do nothing more than list the shows, host and summary where available.
Just doing that alone creates a whopping 7, and a half hour episode.
Are you late enough to listen? Let's go.
