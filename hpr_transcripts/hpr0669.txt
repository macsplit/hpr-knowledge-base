You're listening to syndicated Thursday on Hacker Public Radio.
Today we're going to take an episode from the QSK neckcast, originally aired on October
15, 2010.
This is a talk that Ros gave at the Ohio Linux Fest 2010, and it's entitled The Origins
of Open Source.
And it's apt that we're talking about Linux Fest, as I would like to take a moment to
ask you for some help.
The Linux Fest northwest is going ahead in Bellingham, Washington, on the 30th of April
to the 1st of May, 2011.
And we are going to be represented by a booth.
You can get more information at the northeastlinxfest.org.
And we would like some help in finding people to come and join our team at the tables,
and some finding, some equipment, and if you have any more ideas for tables.
If you would like to have more information about this, if you can go to the Hacker Public
Radio.org website, and hopefully we'll have some information available for you there.
So if you would like, if you're in the Washington area, anywhere near this festival, it would
be a cool festival to attend, and if you're interested in helping us out and meeting
some of the hosts here at HBR, please feel free to come up and say hello.
There's going to be stickers and possibly some business cards available for you on the
day.
We're actually running competition for business cards that are going to be hopefully
printed and distributed over there on that day.
So if you are good with art in any way and want to put some together, the front, we can
have ten, a hundred different versions for the front of the business cards.
So if you want to make your mark on HBR, now is a green to do it.
And now, back to the show.
Welcome to the Black Sparrow video, you don't have broadcast network.
So we're going to do a little bit more of that, and we're going to do a little bit more
of that.
So we're going to do a little bit more of that, and we're going to do a little bit more
of that.
So here's this topic for a few words, and I have to clarify what I did.
It's a very rigorous kind of story, it's such a lost date.
You know, most people almost forgot something about it already, and don't need to have an
hash report or a booklet.
If you do, well, you may know it's something like this.
You can do a brief examination of the methodology that I have in this course.
So I'm going to give you a little bit more of that, and I'm going to give you a little bit
of that.

We had this Egyptian books.
And since this is not Mr. Rezik,
there has been this many years in New York,
a cracker for the Egyptians,
I mean, this sort of developed
a pyramid building, a concept pyramid building,
a rock site tunnel,
and a site of James King,
which will lead each other.
But this is not really an option.
This is about the idea of building a pyramid building.
This is about the idea of building a pyramid building.
Somebody had New York at the beginning,
it's like, well, when we died,
we lost spiritual ascension.
I don't see that building up to that level
in the street being building.
And maybe it's an example for ourselves.
Well, it's a collective.
Well, apparently one guy, it's like him.
So, I don't see any inspiration
about the whole bunch of people.
They're holding it in their own way.

and something that you create or water is,
then it's out of your motor thinking.
Some people think it was something,
but it wasn't.
Speaking of your Tesla,
some people think this guy got to the lower inch,
20th century.
And, you know,
he certainly did most of the experimentation
with water,
some people on electricity,
you know,
left on the side,
and I've been on this for a year,
and I've been on this for a while,
I've been on this for a while.
I've been on this for a while.
In many cases,
that last bullet point
that he was clearly concerned,
but I think most of you
can say to me we'll have
and most of you know
which is where,
exactly,
because he didn't check out.
Let me have your scan.
You have a mark on it.
It's supposed to be different to the reading.
But if you ask anybody, you're going to be able to pay $1,000.
This guy over here was tested.
Let's see if someone had to look down at him.
There you go.
Okay.
No problem.
Come on.
Why?
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Anyway.
So, I'm coming into reading.
Sort of.
Anyway.
All of that is not interesting.
Because the forecast I just mentioned were all teams.
If you will.
The capital is a world.
They were interested in money.
They were interested in power.
They were interested in patents.
They were interested in pizza.
I will look.
That's a pair of words.
One of the most interesting developments in that is even though that's the capital.
And the financial and their technology.
We're taking advantage of the protectability of that goal.
And the people who made it up.
We need experiments.
We can't do radio offerings.
We need engineers to tell us what they want.
And their quest for learning.
Like patent, you know.
Long jetty.
And gave it to all of us.
Who invented Daniels.
For our health distribution.
And this happened.
You know, for four minutes.
So, the idea of radio.
As a public media.
This is to rise.
For those.
For those first ideas.
And this is another one of those reasons why things have to happen together.
We can't add all these words without those words.
We can't.
We can't do it without you.
I don't even know.
So, these are some of the things that we have now.
Because of the slow source, I know.
I know.

So, like again, you know what I'm saying again, so I'm going to give some tape and we have to,
we have to do a cab to do the kids to be able to solve it.
This is a splatter and weep rinse.
And what's in there represent, represent the source.
If you have access to one of these basic paper, it tells you how to build this micro control
if it's on a lot or there are other things on the ground.
And then you can do something that's really sourced and it's derived from the standard
and someone who figured out that these are electronic devices.
And we're dropping it in some part, or in a most important part,
unless they're not Tesla.
And we'll all be able to do what's back to becoming a sub to be a thing of electricity
to provide wireless electricity to the world.
And it's become a digital industry.
It's early, 1983.
This is a way to do it.
1983, kind of a middle year, when the idea of low-consourced and the embodiment of low-consourced
kind of got together.
There's an interesting mix of the slide, of an open, close thing.
Behind this gap, it's kind of a projector of low-consourced, open sources
and people have studied this in a way that they created the concept of open standards.
And they also created the IRC, the idea of the IRC in the question of the problem,
which is a low-consourced way to be able to make an idea is to develop future standards.
Well, DARPA, which a lot of people probably consider due to black magic,
and what are the new government's new webinars.
They use all those standards as open standards to develop an idea to do their work.
Now, what comes in that work?
Anybody can say, nobody can say that.
It's the most important part of DARPA.
And I guess no one can admit to that, it is rigged.
But they use open standards, because they see it as a big thing.
They also use your question problems.
You need that work.
And this is one of the most closed, most of the best,
in these secretive adulterated pages, these things that exist today.
You know, not counting data set.
So, the best way to use English is to work.
And that would be a requirement for the work of DARPA.
Maybe they were kind of better.
So, the Richard Strong obviously was an ordinance in the three,
but this is what each of the ideas is that things come a little well,
some of the other people, and joined to join it together to do things like that,
that the idea is here, commonly, and started to resolve that by magic.
And also, now, it's the idea of the things that these standards do.
It's like free software, copy left thing,
which copy left thing was a real interstate legal,
legal English concept, where instead of using copy running to retain your rights,
you use copy left thing to make sure that the rights are remote
that everyone is given to work with.
So, being kind of the opposite of copy, we called it copy left.
You also created this document that many people call a whole GPL.
The equivalent license is what makes Linux, Linux,
Linux, but what you would eliminate the second language class
who are akl v. Cleveland, will focus on the Saudi region very quickly.
And most of the work that was done in crowd meeting these ideas
was done over the Greek vice, and being successful.
And the Greek vice represented the internet, and who are doing it?
Accepting that the service program will start as an open source idea,
idea? No, not at all. Because one idea also would be another, and no, that would exist.
Stalking was also an integral of creating the standard mathematical physics. We'd be actually
created how to fold blocks. Some of these can fit your physics. It's a standard,
or a method. We still use today to use alphabet. Now, the reason that Emax comes into this
is because I had to come back to religion and something like this. Stalking is kind of
more religious-like kind of. These are the piece of clothes that are easy to reach itself.
It is. It isn't anyone who's going to be able to help us or sell it.
R-I-S is the gap. These are some of the reasons why Emax told me it wasn't created.
So everybody in which we would like to do Emax is in fact an origin of scholars.
He calls himself St. Emax, a pretty specific religious group. He also calls five, five or five
three times. It's also happened to be the equivalent of six in the end of your piece.
So these religious concepts just can't get away from it. You know, if you show them out,
the idea that it can source to some is religion. This is the beginning of the text.
G-P-L. There are lots of open source licenses these days. G-P-L is one of the
most important G-P-L is so prominent because it's the limits.
Everything that is limits is the least number of G-P-L. After your B-S-D, you're going to see some of the
chords out there. B-S-D is the least that can be used in the lessons.
Well, there's kind of a, not a problem necessarily, but there's an interesting scientific
B-S-D lessons. The G-P-L, because it's a copyright,
promotes that in anything from least number of G-P-L, it's used to be G-P-L,
which means everything going forward will be three elements,
rather than what else to build in a scam. B-S-D almost takes notes of
research. B-S-D is so old that it's closed because you can take B-S-D now.
Right, close to it, it's awkward, but at least it went up here, which is busy.
So, there it is, the meaning again. So, downside to open is B-S-D license.
Well, for some things, it's not a great idea to write off a B-S-D or a B-S-D,
so throw it there, and then just at least have a B-S-D license.
You really don't care about practice, do you? But, if you want something to stay
open, you have to use different lessons in G-P-L's people.
So, the new project, again, Richard Smallman, started since
February 1983, where the G-P-L is developed by him.
So, does anyone know what the new project is?
I don't know. It is a good question. You know why it's a good question?
They probably may get too complicated with the panel,
instead of changing any more of us. It's actually because of the
experiments that it's in the industry.
You didn't even hear it. It's actually what Linux is supposed to be.
The problem is, you knew a new project, got all their software
done, except for the algorithm system. The algorithm system was supposed to be
heard, heard on the internet.
When they put them up for the micro-protection, everything
can be used for all the start-up engineers.
When they got to the point, they discovered a lot of programs
really hard. So, they got to that in 1921.
Try to promote it, get it heard.
And then, Torbal, who walks in, says, that they're currently done,
wants to call Linux. So, it says,
how will they move? So, they get together,
and get out of your new Linux.
Which is what it's called, and it's so adding
to that, and how like Linux can do with this.
It was all the software systems, kernel systems.
Now, the new project is still working on the algorithm.
They really like to finish it.
And it's my understanding that it's about 16% of the needs.
And that there's a project called,
Demi, who can have heard, which engineers can download
and install on a test box.
It's definitely not something you want to use in production.
But, even more on, it can be who operates this.
That is nothing of the nature.
If you want to try this, you don't have a project.
It's simply like software systems,
for me, is getting out of your things.
But, can you hear it?
Well, it's not finished. It hasn't been quite done yet.
It doesn't go to the list.
And it's still being developed.
And you can run it out of time, three to six,
and then you've got it.
And it's 64.
So, it's called the concept of the idea of free software.
Which is what's clean.
Free as in.
Reason.
Liberation.
That isn't mine.
Although, it's often free, as computers talk.
Open Source was a term that was used to marketing it.
To modify the free software.
And to make it more accessible to other entities.
To give it a face.
In an era of contingentness.
Of patents.
Of capitals.
Open Source is a face that re-software.
In our capitals society.
It's where we can encapsulate socialism on B3.
Inside the green and everything else.
So, what else is open Source?
Open Source is here.
For a long time.
It's time to talk about software.
And there's also a lot of open Source things that are open.
There are other things that are open.
One of the things that's coming into the world right now is working harder.
There is a deal with both the project.
It's just trying to create open, open, and sell the product.
So, you can do it in whatever you want.
I know where they are.
Right now.
But it's a little prosecuting.
Everybody here certainly already know that.
If you have it, kind of want to check it.
It's going to be open source language control.
People are doing an interesting and crazy way today.
When we are doing it.
It's very cheap.
It's easy to use.
It's a program for software for open source.
It runs here.
It is a company.
And so they get a good project.
So, before something was going on or something.
We created a deal with the smart process.
This project is currently dead.
Thanks to Larry.
If it was not right anymore.
But again, it's an attempt to build.
It's getting better and softer.
There's built-in content.
And it's like created content.
Create a content.
It's one of those things that this is off the RIA and so on.
And that's considered to be that.
That's considered that person.
With the media.
It's open source content.
And as everybody knows, you have to do to take open source content.
but the main fault against.
No one was the committee.
They're giving back-to-prove solutions.
And now because it's somewhat aprender and open thing,
it's into the Oh Error related transportation.
These organizations are open with health organizations
when they use source software.
They use NASA series,
by logos for capitalists and roads and scientists.
You know, this is not actually something
that needs to be put in our institutions.
Organizations to deal with things that are hilarious.
Third world diseases, and things like...
Oh, listen, I can't make it up.
Anyway, stuff that I know is developing
on this forum, and this forum.
These initiatives are decided to deal with those.
Because as Chris Cross says,
if there's no money, then there's never going to be a cure.
Scale of the citizens today, 27 years after the foundation
of the Free Software Foundation,
and the surgeons and the insurgents
are more of this.
So, Mr. President Cross,
if you remember me, in software,
we were able to run out of the source
with a little extra money at least.
We love stuff that's free and free as it would be here.
Free is a bit of a downgrade.
But real freedom in the open source
is the freedom from patents and conferences.
The thing is that it keeps technology down.
It keeps that open source religion
and that socialism and finance can happen.
The second moment in the lemur section,
please take that card.
This is why I had thoughts.
Software patents are people and grants.
Do whatever you can, my friend.
And if you've got it,
if you've got it all,
you can make sure you know more of this large book
which you're looking to have right now,
please give it more.
I believe that free,
you know, it's their software,
is in ultimately a single goal.
But we have to be patient.
We have to not get the rights.
We have to not be in a guy
who's supposed to accept this bill in order to get them.
We have to coexist with our hapless brethren.
We have to not just the people
walking around in the item
while we live around our animals.
I also did it because of the source
of what powerful idea
and because it has more educated matters
that will come out on top of the visual world.
But that's it.
Today, we just go on about our lives
and promote, do, and,
and we'll give everything
that's needed all the experience.
And I'm going to end this topic
because, hopefully not too quickly,
with a little, what kind of 49 seconds
of music gets a little bit,
it gets out of the top,
or what kind of 49 seconds.
Does anybody here familiar with
a group of musicians?
I don't know, I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know.
Okay, so the rest of you
is close to me.
Now, the reason this topic is interesting to be,
is because it's a song about the need
of close to source.
It's about just life.
Specifically, no games.
It's interesting about the song,
because it's not creative thrones.
I have to make permission
from the author to play.
So, once again,
my co-existent,
and that was society,
to bring me something interesting
and not able to walk.
It's also an unique group.
Take that, watch it walk.
This is the case.
No.
It certainly turned out all along.
Try it.
You won't know my plug.

Hey.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, now, it was at least now, it was going to be on from outside.
But it was sort of a precursor of Linux, it was well developed before the
architecture, the architecture is architecture.
So, it's in that time, it's a lot of criticism, mine's set.
So, I guess that's how it would be.
Well, that did.
Here it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you for listening to Half Republic Radio.
HPR is sponsored by Carol.net, so head on over to C-A-R-O dot-E-T for all of us.
Thank you.
