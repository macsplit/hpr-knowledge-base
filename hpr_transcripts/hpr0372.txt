"...
It don't matter if you want to fight, but they get outside tonight, we can talk about politics, but that won't make it all right.
It don't matter what you do, the truth is your computer should be using a new, it don't matter if that's not you, I'll be using Linux if you want me to.
Because it's a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day for me.
Sometimes files upside down, servers crashing a head to ground, you don't need to worry my friend, you don't need to have a friend.
This place has a name for you, this place can show you something new, this place has a smile for you, this place of yours.
It's a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day for me.
That's all my friends, for this week, I hope you enjoyed the show, I don't know what we'll be doing, but I hope the song's better for you.
I tried, what can I tell you, came up with this song about five minutes flat, because it's a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, a new day, tomorrow's a new day, a new day, and hopefully I'll have a new episode out next week.
At BlueLinuxBasement.com, come on by and see us, take care, have a great week.
Thank you.
