Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to Hacker Public Radio.
This is the community news show for the crowdsourced podcast network that is Hacker Public Radio.
We exist on the contributions of our community members to submit shows for the month and this
month this show we record once a month and anyone is free to join us and discuss what's
been going on in the last month on the community.
Join us tonight is Dave, hello everybody, and a drive by visitor Kiddie, how are you?
Hello, I'm fine.
So gone through as we do the new horse, Dave, can you introduce the new horse this month?
Yes, we have one new host this month, Norrist, I think is the way you pronounce it, or Norrist
Tia, I can't remember, but Anodoma IST is our new host.
Fantastic, that was the SQLite and Bash show.
Alrighty, let's go through the shows so that you know that they have been listened to and
scored on a, I'm not, we don't score them.
We have definitely listened to all the shows.
So we've, and I've been asked about this Dave, how many people listen to the shows and I'm
actually thinking of doing a show about that.
So in order to have feedback about answering the question, how many people listen to a
HPR show, I've done some calculations, and I was on the IRC chat, and I was in a conversation
with you about it as well.
You were?
Yes, yes.
So what I would like you to know, what I would like people to do, everybody write in,
just admin at hackerpublicradio.org, and tell us if you were counting the number of
people who subscribe or, so, if you wanted to count, if you wanted statistics from HPR,
what would those statistics be?
Let's make it as generic as possible.
If you wanted statistics for a presentation or you were just interested, what would those
statistics be?
And can you send in what you think that should be?
And just to give you an idea, the number of downloads from a particular IP address,
what would you exclude, would you exclude all the bots, and what would you include?
That sort of thing.
If, I don't know if I make, I want to make this as generic a question as possible, so people
I can encourage as many different viewpoints on what that should be as possible, so I can
run through all of them.
But I don't, I don't know, do I need to give a certain amount of information about the
information we gather or what, what do you reckon Dave, do you know where I'm going
with this?
Yeah, but basically it's a question that when you ask it, you think, oh, that's an easy
question.
Why haven't you answered me about that?
And then you start to think about it, and you realize it's no way an easy question,
because if your question is how many listeners, well, that's a difficult one, how many
don't loaders?
Well, that was one you were just alluding to, is that people, bots, etc, etc.
It becomes very, very, very complicated, and so getting some definitions is the critical
thing.
Yeah.
So if people can give us some definitions of what they would like to see in the stats,
we can produce the stats, and then I can use that as a discussion point for how accurate
that is.
Now, so if you're asking the question, how many people listen to your shows?
You can guarantee you that two people do, and that would be me, and Dave, unfortunately
Dave, if it's your show, which is this one here, hacking the inner ear, all I can guarantee
is that one person listened to your show, and that was me.
And I found it interesting, Dave, so that's good to know, that therefore proves it's
of interest to hackers.
So it was hacking my inner ear, how I discovered new things about my inner ear and how it works,
with massive dislikers about this is not a medical advice in any way.
But it was very interesting.
What was happening in your ear and how you went, the whole three-dimensional aspect of
how you managed to get that out of your fascinating stuff?
It's an interesting subject, I'm particularly fascinated by these things.
I hope many other people are as well, but some people are probably quite, quite revolted
and disgusted by it as well.
I don't think there was that much about it, I mean, life as life we are basically machines
at the end of the day.
And what I found out is quite a lot of the normal medical science is, you know, mechanical
in nature, the quactor inner shoulder, it's a mechanical thing that needs to go back.
So, yes.
So there was no comments on that, so we will move on to the next show, which was overhauling
a bicycle hub.
And this one, this is one from John Culp in Lafayette, Louisiana, describing how
he overhauls and renovates his rear hub from his road bike, Schwinn bike, is it?
That's right, yeah.
And the classic $2 lip lapel microphone comes back.
What do we call, we're going to call this series something, but we didn't get around to
somebody proposed a very good one in the show, and the mailing list this month.
Oh, I don't remember, I don't remember.
We'll check it out after, I guess, of course, we'll come across it.
I, yeah, it's a shame there were no pictures of this, because I had difficulty visualizing,
but John explains why, because he was up to his elbows in Greece, that it's, you know,
just might be nice to have an actual picture, rather than a mental picture of what was going
on there.
But I guess it's like all bicycle hubs, if you have a derailleur gear set on it, it will
be there.
That's a good thing I would guess.
I thought I was able to follow along, okay, maybe it was completely wrong, but it's always
nice to sneak back and just have a quick check in the show notes and the pictures to see
if what's in your imagination is correct or not.
That's right, that's right.
It was, it was interesting though, it was, I wasn't quite clear what he was doing to
start with, and then I looked at a YouTube on that very subject to see, what is this
going on?
Oh right, now I get it, now I get it, I've not done this much, you can gather.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
So the following day, Dave and I had a discussion about the correct way to hang toilet paper
and other topics, so it was the community news show for last month, and Tony Hughes replied
that, hi guys, you wanted to know how about the action I used to buy my computer from.
The company is called Northern Realizations, the specialize in disposing of old corporate
stock, no longer required, much of what the sale goes to the refurbishment market, but
they have a public action once a month in Bolton, UK, and he includes a link to their
website.
Very cool.
Bolton's a bit far from me, but good to know.
And here is the answer actually to us, Kitty Murray, do you want me to do that one?
Please do, yeah.
Kitty Murray says, audio tours, Ken was looking for a name for the episodes that people
record out in the world rather than in the studio.
The name I'm familiar with is a sand-seeing tour.
These are always great because they're ambient nature and that they provide a unique perspective
on the subject by recording it on location.
This might be a good series too.
You're right, I'd forgotten this, that's actually a great way of explaining it.
Yeah, a sand-seeing tour, it's absolutely perfect and we should make a series out of those
actually.
I will make a note.
Thank you Dave, I expect to do.
Get on it.
The following day was my old home server by Mr X and I loved this because he's got a
compact iPAC desktop computer and I loved these ones.
I had one doing exactly the same thing, well not exactly the same thing, but I had one
of these little computers as well and the speaker was enormously loud on it.
But I never thought to use the beep to tell me that it was doing stuff.
Now that's quite interesting, yeah, yeah, I also saw these things and they were quite
popular for people and always wanted to get one but never managed to find one at the
reasonable price.
So that was quite an interesting thing.
There were a sort of thing if you had IT departments, you put them at the reception desk
because you didn't want loud machines around, you put them where things needed to be quiet.
Yeah, people had them sort of kiosks and things, didn't they, and I also saw other small
jobs like that.
Excellent stuff.
So the following day we had SQL light and bash from our first time host, Norrisd, who
I hope will continue bringing shows and they don't have to be of this quality, but yeah,
it would be cool.
And this was an absolutely brilliant idea and I have, and also so very simple, just the
premise of the show just for people.
They wanted to see how size of disk usage of files and directories changed over time.
And you usually see it, when this happens, your server is usually full up and then you have
to use the du command to go around and find out where the files are and do the calculations.
And basically he used a cron job to go around midnight, three in the morning actually to
go through the data file and create a directory with a report of what the du command disk usage
command shows, then a script to make a SQL file and then imported it into the SQL database,
which I'm sure you approve of Dave.
Absolutely.
Yeah, no, SQL lights brilliant thing and it's great for these sorts of, sorts of jobs.
That is a great idea, yeah, it's really impressed with this.
As did Mac Rackett, who said I found this episode very useful, gave me lots of ideas
looking forward to more like it.
In fact, that actually right there, the whole concept that you would use SQL lighting combination
with cron to keep track of this historical stuff was, it's obvious when you hear it,
but it's then ding.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
John Colt made a comment and he said, worst ever, I thought I said, John, a new host
coming on board, you're supposed to be supportive of them, John.
I was very careful to express that question, Martin.
I thought I heard you say at the end of this episode that it might be the worst HBR ever.
No way.
I really enjoyed this.
It was great hearing how you worked your way through the problem and arrived at a usable
solution.
Please do more.
Couldn't agree more.
The gumnos said cleaning up the script.
You could clean up the script by using a here document instead of a temporary SQL file,
something like SQL age three.
I think he got caught by the comment system.
Oh, it will have interpreted his.
He's probably got some greater than signs then.
It said, oh, that looks like HTML.
I'll just throw it away for you just to be friendly.
So shame he didn't let us know or something we could have picked that up for him.
We can still do.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, he wasn't able to come back because of our common crappy, common system.
We need confirmation.
So it could be 24 hours before one of us gets it.
Oh no.
Yeah.
The turn ran pretty fast these days.
Oh, it's a tape.
Yeah.
You know, having the right twings all day.
Is there some sort of road?
Yeah.
Yeah, there's some sort of robot who catches them quite a lot.
I can just picture your house when the comment goes on.
A raspberry pie sends in a slack sign and go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, alert alert somebody
left a comment on the HBR website.
Let's try it and we all run, you know, sliding down, fireman's poles and stuff.
What?
Doors opening automatically as we run to the thing.
Yeah.
It's quite, you just, there's a perfect picture you have there.
That's exactly why you need to leave comments, folks.
And remember, Dave is in the UTC times on.
So pick the forced awkward times as possible.
Middle of the night is my favorite.
Yeah, exactly.
Uh, Kevin O'Brien and you do commons?
Oh, sorry.
Um, I got, I got lost with that in that image of running to fix comments.
Um, Kevin O'Brien says it's for all of the cinemas, HBR commons this time it's personal.
I've got, I've even got a show coming up, which I haven't finished yet about how I do
this stuff.
Anyway, um, Kevin says excellent show.
I was listening to this show on my drive to work into work and I was thinking that it
epitomizes what we mean by something of interest to hackers.
I want to hear more from Norris.
Anyway, very true, very good comment.
And Norris replied to the hero document, thanks for the tip.
And I did not know what the hero document was and I had to look that up, even despite
the fact that I use it quite a lot in my daily life.
And it is putting in a marker and there within a text file and using the three arrow signs
to pipe in a array of data, but I guess Dave, you could explain this a lot better than
I could.
It's, it's something I've sort of thought about because I'm doing an on and off series
about bash, odds and salts, that's definitely something to add to it at some point down the
road.
So yeah, good stuff.
Definitely.
Oh, and I commented on this and said, I enjoyed this, a good topic for a show I thought.
I enjoyed following your thinking, your solution, the audio was good and the background
noise was not distracting at all.
He was a bit nervous about those things.
I never use full paths to command.
I can see cases where perhaps you perhaps I should have you been bitten by not doing this
in the past.
If so, I'd like to hear about it.
I wondered why the date program used in the Krong tab entry was slash bin slash date,
whereas it was slash user slash bin slash date in the main script.
Are you working across different OSs or architectures?
I think forward to more.
I have.
In fact, gotten hit by that problem and it comes from you see it more where the paths for
a root user is different from the paths for a user that's running as a, you know, a
root user will have access test bin on a devian system, but not on a regular user will
not have access to those.
So some of the commands that will work in a root Krong job will not work as a user
Krong job and vice versa.
And also we've got aliases installed and depending on where you install them, the aliases
will clobber the date command if you just put in date.
Yes, yes, yes.
So it is good practice in general, but I suppose it's me really.
I've just got a bit lazy.
I used to work on a system which had your home directory on a server and then you got
access to different workstations, one of which might be Ultrix, one might be Sonos.
And then if you move from one to the other, then you could not, you had great difficulty
in knowing where a given tool was, you know, your pathing was very critical between the
systems.
So yeah, but I've sort of put all that behind because I don't work in that area anymore.
So I'm lazy, lazy my old age, it's probably what it is.
Okay, moving on to GNU Ock part one, which is by be easy and you're good self if I'm
not mistaken.
That's right.
This is a brilliant collaboration.
Be easy is providing very, very clear and useful information.
And then we have shows from you as well.
I like the way you said that, isn't that as well?
Yes, not at all.
I think it's brilliant the way you're doing this.
And this is like, I think in years to come, people will look back on this show and go,
look at, you know, fully fledged in that series, like, like Kevin O'Brien's lead by office
one and your bash ones and this series, you know, the said, I can don't forget Grep,
which is hopefully on your list, as shows that, okay, guys, you're welcome to your new
job.
Here's a, here's a wedge of podcasts that you have to listen to before you allow you root
access, you know.
Yeah, yeah, that would be, that would be good.
It's, we've actually been talking about maybe making a more readable version of these
notes, you know, maybe a PDF version or something like that, but we'll see whether that
would be a good idea.
Might also be interesting to do some video stuff because I've been thinking about that as
well, how shows, I've been thinking of that we've had the request to put some shows up
on Facebook and YouTube.
It was one of the comments from the podcast awards that, you know, you shouldn't ignore
these platforms because there's lots of people up there.
And something like that, where somebody's done the audio for a show that you follow along
with a screencast, and yeah, I was just seeing that in my head how the logistics of that
would work.
I've often wondered that myself, actually, I was going to throw an animated gif or two
into one thing I was doing, but I thought it would just be more of a nuisance than anything
else.
I think a YouTube thing might be, might be good for a screencast, as you say.
Yeah, if there's somebody who wants to get into, somebody wants to take that on for us,
not necessarily then every show gets that, you know, the full Monty treatment, but some
shows like this might be handy just to print off the commands as they're typing them out
probably useful.
Okay, no comments on that yet.
I'm sure that will change in the fullness of time.
And the following day, we had wind go yet again, wasting shows by putting three in the
one show, but he has come up with, this is probably a series by now, if I'm, yeah,
apps plonking three.
So it's officially a series.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I miss that one.
Yeah.
No DM, CMUS and PA record.
He seems to be able to keep coming up with them.
So I can't really be too harsh with him about the fact that he's wasting three episodes per
three items per episode.
And the tools were a small utility to start ex automatically, which is actually a brilliant
idea because, and he did mention it was a security risk, but I run a single, you know,
my laptop, the only person logging in is myself or various different forms of myself depending
on where I'm on the network.
And if I already need to put in a password to decrypt it so to, uh, to log in, it might
be an idea, but I do need to lock the screen, obviously, when I walk away.
So I can see in cases where that will be useful, um, CMUS, a console based music player and
PA record, uh, handy record, uh, tool for pulse audio, which I was not aware of the command
line music player.
I, um, stuck in my world of just using an emplier and don't think I'll ever leave it to
be honest.
I, yeah, for that.
I could probably use it.
I did use, uh, CMUS or CMUS or have you say it because I saw the recommendation from
Chalkalong Gavin who, uh, on GNU social.
I tried it.
It actually, uh, didn't work very well for me because in my music folders, I have some
compositions from my son and something he'd done crashed it, so, uh, never managed to
get to the bottom of my heart.
Okay.
Uh, hello.
Bye.
I use, uh, uh, uh, CMUS.
And do you like us?
Uh, I did like it.
Sometimes I open it and, uh, have it, uh, living inside the terminal, uh, living inside
the terminal, uh, inside our two mix, uh, thing.
And if I accidentally closed, um, terminal, the CMUS still go on and I forgot about the
version.
Come from here.
Oh, very good.
Yes.
That's a good idea to run us on T-mox, which is like, uh, a sort of screen session thing which
in itself, if you ever wanted to do a show about, uh, T-mox, you can go to HPR and record
a show.
But yes.
Very cool.
And how big is your library of songs?
Uh, ten songs.
Very good.
So, I used to use it for learning it, not for using it as my, my, uh, music player.
But I ended up listening to the songs like 24 times because you'd lose down in your
T-mox session.
Yeah.
Very good.
Very good.
Sometimes in the morning, I've totally forgot where the song come from.
I accidentally had it going on all night till morning.
That is interesting.
That's very funny.
I didn't understand it.
It's, uh, not happened so often, uh, very lately, because I learned from it.
I learned is exactly what we're all about here.
The ones we'll comment on this show from Be Easy and says, thanks for PA record.
I will try it when I record my next episode.
As for CMOS, I can't recommend it enough.
I have a NAS with an NFS share full of thousands of songs.
Uh, most graphical players choke when uploading the library, but CMOS handles it like
a champ.
I agree the controls take a bit of getting used to it, but it's worth it in the end.
Plus, it fits into an I-3 workflow perfectly.
What's a I-3 workflow?
I hope you knew the answer to that after I did.
I-3 is a Windows Manager.
Is it?
Only Linux.
I have never heard about it.
Oh, I heard about it very much.
It doesn't like it, but I heard about it many of my Linux friends use it.
I see here in the Fedora magazine.
All right.
Somebody has to do a show about that.
Gosh, if there was only person that knew something about I-3 and admittedly only found out
about HPR 10 minutes ago.
But if you could record a show about this, how to use it, what it does, that would be awesome.
Or otherwise, somebody else can do it.
Yeah, I can maybe give some tips to how to review it.
Perfect.
Like, the host thing is that things, who gives you an email of something about it.
Did you understand that?
Sorry, you know.
Sorry about what did you say?
The hostess.
How do they come about to be host?
Well, what they do is, I'm very glad you asked me that question.
You record something and you go to the HPR website and you press the upload button and you type
in your email address and they will send you a link to a form where you type in the information
about the show and about yourself.
And then you add the recorded file that you've just met and then you become a host.
It's as simple as that.
So it does, it do that.
Do it about the text then?
So say you wanted to become a host and you wanted to talk, you need to find something to talk about.
So say you wanted to talk about the I3 window manager.
You record a show on your mobile phone or in your computer or something.
And you start talking about it.
And then once that, once you have a file of you talking about it, you upload it to our website
and then that automatically makes your host.
And next month tune in, Dave and I will talk about your show.
Oh, but the text in this show notes, do you make it or does the host make it?
The host makes it and if the host doesn't make it, then we will make it.
Oh, so it's optional then?
Well, optional with a, we would prefer you to make it.
Yeah.
Motion for you is all host asleep.
We're writing to you.
Yeah, you know, you know more about it than we do.
So you probably do a better job of preparing notes than we would, you know,
trying to work at what you would have written.
So better if you do it.
And sometimes it's just going getting links together to websites that people can read up about it.
And if the links are there, we can put in some, you know, if you link to Wikipedia or something,
we can copy in a bit from Wikipedia so that people know where to get more information.
That's all it is.
Dave, Dave and Be Easy are doing very, very detailed show notes for their OX series.
But that's like a project that they're doing about OX.
So they're going into a lot of detail.
And the show notes really help because it's a complicated topic.
And the next show that we're talking about, which is Duffer Gardening, which was a prior to a Duffer cast,
which is another podcast.
Chalcolum, Iskernos, God Iskiness.
Can you do this?
Yes, it's Michael.
His real name is Inces, who is an HPR host.
He's done one show.
I hope he's going to do more.
I know that doesn't stop me butchering people's names, Dave.
No, no, no, no.
And Chalcolum is Gavin.
And as I've put in the notes here is the other guy.
Everybody has difficulty saying his name.
Chalcolum, very, very good.
And basically your show notes about that is some links to who they are.
And more information about the Duffer cast and the Bug cast and the,
and they've planned a link to the Wikipedia article.
So nothing, we lost KGG there for a while.
And now he's back.
Yeah, accidentally click on the other channel.
Yeah, we were just saying that the next episode has got some, you know,
it's, it's very light on the notes, but it's got some links to where you can get more information if you want it.
Yeah, do you go up or down, but then you go through notes?
We start as...
Oh, it doesn't actually, when you're uploading a show, it doesn't actually matter.
You fill in all the fields that you need to fill in and then you press upload and that's it.
Yeah, but I try to follow your subject and I'm not sure if you're going up,
going up or down notes.
Through the list of shows, you mean?
Yeah.
We're going an increasing number.
Yeah, so we're now on 2116.
And the 2292117 next then.
That's absolutely right.
Yes.
Yeah, I start thinking you go up and...
So there were some comments on this show 2116.
First was from Cole, who says info.
Can you put a bit more info in the blurb about the talk?
So I'm not quite clear what this, what this Cole he or she meant.
So I replied to that saying, hi, Cole, thanks for the comment.
What sort of information were you looking for?
Explanations of terms, links, not quite sure what you need.
So hopefully we'll get an answer to that.
The comment system is not very obvious place to go and look for discussions and stuff,
unfortunately, but hopefully we'll get an answer to that.
I'm happy to extend the notes if that's what's being asked for.
Yep.
Okay.
So now we're on episode 2117.
What's in my bag for Podcroll, which Dave from the little bug.
Brought with him when he was going under London, Podcroll,
and he brought a lot of stuff just as well.
He didn't record this prior to the event or he would have gotten mugged.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, some quite expensive stuff in there.
Indeed there is.
But some nice stuff actually.
Some good rundown of what you could have if you're a professional podcaster and wish to record on the go.
Yeah, I was impressed with this actually.
He's got a portable Samson mic, which they're quite good.
That's what I'm using a non-portable Samson at the moment on a boom.
But it's, you know, they're quite good value things.
But that's quite a mic to be taken to a pub, though.
And a little just Olympus recorded, too, which I find quite interesting.
I looked at those and thought, gosh, they look like, you know, dictaphones or something.
But they're actually a lot better.
This is just me being stupid, I guess.
Yeah.
It's, they're actually quite high quality devices.
The, uh, someone I thought actually when I was doing the research for my own H2 Zoom,
I was thinking of the dictaphones and I got my hands on one and the audio was terrible.
Absolutely brutal.
Yeah.
That was, that was my thought, because say it's just the fact that there is some sound recorded
is, is all that they're aiming to, to get to, where is this Olympus DM3?
I think it's a, is a much, much classier device.
Yeah.
Okay.
We will move on to the next episode, which was episode 2118.
What is app inventor?
And this was by nature Jordy.
And app inventor is, uh, Android is an open source application provided by Google,
now maintained by the MIT, which gives you a graphical, um, way to create applications for the Android OS.
And I think this is, this is one of the ones that I have now on my list for, uh,
when my kids start getting more mobile phones and apps and stuff,
that they can start using those to control things on the Raspberry Pi's on their desk, you know, that sort of thing.
Yeah, that would be great.
I've not looked at it yet, but, uh, definitely like to have a, have a wee look at how that works for myself.
This, uh, this whole idea of the, the drag and job programming, I was a bit dubious about it myself
to start off with.
But when I see, um, the kids at it is very, you get very productive very quickly with it and the concepts
are nice and clearly laid out.
Yeah, sounds good.
Go ahead.
Got me to think of when you, uh, thing Apple did, uh, doing, uh, easier to program programming.
Is that a similar sort of thing where you, uh,
see the concept?
Yeah.
Yeah, very good.
And the vet is, uh, I talked to my mod, uh, my brother is going to have it on school next year.
Oh, okay.
And what age is he then?
Uh, what year are we in?
Well, you know, more or less, is he in, uh, is he in first basic school or done to secondary school or university?
Um, he's, uh, six.
And already getting computer programming lessons?
Yeah.
Uh, but the vet is drag and drop kind of thing.
Yeah, still.
It's computer lessons.
Yeah.
Uh, and it's, um, it's, um, it's added as, um, standard, um, um, thing to learn.
It's from the start.
Part of the syllabus now.
Yeah.
Excellent.
We are way behind folks.
And you're in Germany if I'm just telling the listeners.
Uh, no, I'm, uh, in Norway.
Norway?
Uh, for some reason, the KDG reminded me of a, uh, German company for some reason.
So you're in Norway.
What part of Norway?
I should have asked.
Um, self.
It's better.
It's better word.
It could be.
Can you pay us for a different, uh, direction of north?
Ah, very good.
Is, is that the self?
The south.
Yes.
The opposite of north.
Very good.
So we're, uh, looking at episode two, one, one, nine, making chocolate chip cookies.
And this would be a sound scene tour, I guess.
Indeed.
And it's, well, it's actually part of the cooking series by J. John Culp.
And he describes the recipe of making chocolate chip cookies.
And I was on the train.
I go in past waste when I was listening to this.
I always find it amazing that I am somewhere else.
And then I'm in a kitchen in Lafayette, Louisiana, listening to the everyday life of somebody.
He has a kitchen aid.
And my wife was looking for a kitchen solution.
And she picked a Kenwood model.
And she did so much research on it that I wanted her to do a HPR show on her reasoning behind picking one over the other and what the benefits were.
And they are very expensive.
But as John says, they are definitely worth it.
If you're doing cooking or anything of that nature, we have definitely saved so much money.
Um, uh, by getting that because we may call our own bread now.
So we save literally three, four euros a week on, uh, and having this thing in just on that.
Yep, I would agree with that.
I also have a Kenwood and I make bread with it.
And it's, uh, it's lasted a long, long time.
Yes, but she refuses to record shows.
Don't know why.
There you go, folks.
That's why I have to pester the rest of you.
So the price is for the device, not the cake or the cookies.
No, the cookies are, uh, I don't think that expensive.
I start wondering.

Um, baking cookies.
Very good.
Yes.
Yes.
So, John, John Cup replied to, to Mrs. Zook's comment saying,
Mom's wisdom.
Haha, it's good to know that this was helpful.
I've got to give credit where it's due though.
It was my mom that taught me this when I was probably 10 or 12 years old.
She knows how to do basically everything.
That's what moms are all about.
And guitar man said, yum.
I've made these twice in two days now.
Couldn't resist.
I've bought the chocolate chips a bit since I'm using gluten free flour.
And I need a bit more chocolate to cover that up.
Thank you very much for sharing and firing me to make coffee cookies.
Have them met them in years, smiley face.
So, cooking series going down a bomb here on HPR?
It's great to see it, isn't it?
Yeah.
Very happy.
Now, the other end of the extreme.
You never know what was going to turn up on HPR.
And we had operator making a very, very welcome return.
With WebDome, WMAP, eyewitness, PhantomJS and Selenium.
Automate the process of finding unique sites, removing duplicates and getting screenshots.
Now, I don't know how many people in the world need to do this from time to time.
But I happen to be one of them.
And these tools, this approach is definitely a way to go.
I would not have, I wasn't aware of the eyewitness tool.
And the burp WMAP change request scanner was a new one to me.
So, very nice, very interesting show.
Here was a case where there was some video too that was sort of added quite a lot to the understanding.
I wasn't quite clear what this was about until I sat and looked at the video.
I think actually, if you've ever done this, having done had to do this a few times myself.
Then it became, it was from the world goal completely obvious what he was trying to do.
But I can get that if you've never done this, it's kind of a niche thing.
And you can see, be easy coming out of the shadows there.
Oh, I've got to try some of this stuff more episodes, please.
So, if this is what you do, if this floats your boat.
And again, this is like the impact of the show.
You've got two people going, yes, yes, yes, brilliant episode.
And all the people go scratching their head going, why would you ever want to do this?
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
So, HPI is all about it.
Indeed.
So, have you tried application?
Yeah, it's a, it's basically a, it's more, his episode is less about an application per se,
how his approach to, to go around to various different websites on mass and kind of narrowing down the interesting sites that he needs to look at.
And that's his reasons for doing it.
And my reasons for doing it would be completely different, but sometimes you need to do that.
So, it's, I haven't tried those tools yet, because it's actually a thing I do once, maybe every six months.
And as with quite a lot of things on HPR, I will just file it away and go, OK, I'll go back and listen to that on the day.
So, it's from a make-up of this show or other things?
So, his show is specifically about, about WebDump, WMAP, eyewitness, PhantomJS and Selenium.
Now, are you Selenium, Selenium a bit, PhantomJS I wasn't aware of.
So, the next time that I go to do this task, I will come back to the show and go, OK, which pieces of this can I take and use in my own task?
Yeah, thanks.
OK, no problem, hope that helps.
So, the next day, show 21, 21, dark calls tabletop game.
And this is the first in what people who are fans of Clatu and they are out there.
I'm not saying that like, oh, there are not fans of Clatu, but Clatu's fans have requested a specific feed to follow Clatu, which is available for all our hosts.
By the way, you can subscribe to an individual host on HPR and guarantee that you will always get their shows.
So, for example, in the HPR feeds, you could subscribe to the monthly show, this show that you're listening so that you can hear all the shows that have gone in the last month and decide whether you want to download them.
But, for example, if you know you always want to download everything that Clatu produces, that you can subscribe to Clatu or any of the other hosts and guarantee that you will get their shows as well.
And he has started a series on tabletop gaming.
So, analog gaming, board games, in fact, and I'm really glad to see this.
As is Joe, who said, Rachel, I agree that board games seem like yesterday's history.
I think the 80s music will make a return.
Digital pulls people apart while analog brings them together, like the presentation and look forward to playing the game.
So, very good.
Yes, it was, I'm not really much of a tabletop gamer.
It was a family thing when I was a kid that we played, played analog games a lot when we were together.
But I just have not done it since I grew up.
But listening to Clatu's enthusiasm, I've got it wrong.
I don't think dark calls would be the first one that I would jump into.
And just for DWG and, or sorry, not DWG, KDG.
What Clatu did was, there was an old card game, like sort of Dungeons and Dragons, but you can play it by yourself or with people.
Yeah, I find it to Google it.
Yeah, he has a link in there and he has produced a set of art.
Clatu is a very talented filmmaker, artist, and all-rounder, I guess.
Steve, there's probably a good word for that.
Polymath, I think, is probably the word.
Polymath.
And he has produced a artwork that you can download and print off your own cards based entirely on the game.
But that one seemed a little bit dark to me.
I would be actually terrified going to bed because I am embarrassed to admit this, but I will anyway.
When I'm out in the back room, sometimes I do like a scary voice, like, I'm going to bed.
I'll let have to turn all the lights on and those, because I'm just scared myself so much.
In my defense, I live beside the graveyard itself.
Okay, okay, yeah.
You're always, you're always.
So you can understand why this may not be for me.
So you don't watch spooky movies then?
Oh God, no.
Although sometimes I have to for work, because...
And then...
We work, oh, different work.
Not this work, but for actual, you know, air and a salary work.
Sometimes there might be a problem with some of the movies that we have on our platform
and you're forced to watch them.
One I had to watch was The Bride of Chucky,
which with the soundtrack on is a terrifying movie, but when you have the soundtrack off
and you're listening to, like, happy music, it is this stupid film that you could ever...
She can escape by taking one step to the left.
It was just...
But that's it, yes, I'm always as maybe, but I'm a proud was.
And my wife loves me and that's the most important thing.
I went when the exorcist came out, which is quite some time ago.
I lived, I was a student, and there was a cinema just across the road and I went to see it.
And it was the late night showing.
And I was utterly and completely shattered by the experience.
And one time when my kids were around and they were in their teens,
and I said, we want to see exorcists, it was on the TV.
And they looked at it and they watched it and they said,
that this is so stupid.
And I said, but that's scared the life out of me,
and no, it's rubbish.
So that was me, you know.
It is so nice.
It lays at nice and in a large movie theater and not on the...
And people have become, you know, things have moved on.
Like I was watching a review of some scenes and platoon,
that had become so much of an inspiration for other people
that it's diluted now that it doesn't have the same impact that it did have
when it was originally released.
Yes.
Okay, fine.
Alpha 32 at show 2021-22.
Alpha 32's new machine, built with all AMD components.
And the first time I saw this coming through my feed,
I was thinking using a 32-bit Alpha processor for his machine,
but no, he built it based on the AMD components.
And a very nice show it was.
But I would like to know how much he spent in total on it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree.
I agree.
Doing that sort of thing is not the cheap solution that it used to be, eh?
No, no, no.
I remember like when a built server eight,
it's a lot more years ago now since it replaced it with a pie.
And it was affordable to do it.
But now the only people I know building computers and cells
are those that want specific hardware for, you know, for their rigs.
So I'm just wondering would.
Would Alpha 32 maybe have not got a bet might not have got a better computer,
but would have got a at least cheaper computer with the same performance
by going to Dell or some white box store?
I don't know.
It's just a thought.
But it was an interesting.
You need to be here.
You need to be good that you need to know what you're doing.
And need to know very much about computing to build a chip computer nowadays.
Well, yeah.
Yeah, that's true actually.
Yeah.
So because I think he also got called with a missing a graphics card.
That's one point.
And he had to add an additional graphics card,
which wasn't that probably that much.
But you know, it's it all adds up when you can buy a pretty good computer
from Dell for 250 euros now, you know.
But my dad built the ones are PC and he accidentally crushed his CPU.
Ouch.
And that was the price thing of the whole thing.
Yeah, exactly.
So yeah, yeah, got to be careful.
And it was when he was screwing in the fan thing.
You know what?
Yeah, I'm putting in the fan on top of the heat sink.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the thing about the putting a computer together is then it doesn't boot up.
If it boots up, everything's awesome.
But if it doesn't boot up, then you're listening to beep codes to find out.
Is it the memory?
Is it the processor?
Is it the whatever?
So it's a it can be really, really satisfying.
But it can also be a pain in the buttocks.
I noticed that yes, I am a Mac user.
The shame.
Yeah.
Starting to thinking of switching.
Well, we have a show that will just back in the first time episodes.
We have quite a lot of the MacBooks.
You can even replace your firmware around them.
You can definitely run Linux on them or a more open platform.
BSD's if you wish.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have always been a Mac user.
But I want perfect Linux to replace my perfect Mac.
Yes.
I am perfect.
Yes.
Extremely perfect.
All hooks.
No.
There's no harm in that.
Okay.
Let's move on to 21, 23.
How I make coffee.
How I use my coffee gator.
All aspects of making the perfect cup of coffee in our coffee series.
So the coffee gator is a pretty nice device.
Swan, neck, kettle they have.
And you recommend both.
So I went to the website to have a look at some of their pictures of their stuff.
And I think people get into coffee.
I'm more a more a go over to the automatic and press the cappuccino button.
Kind of coffee guy myself.
I must say.
I have not.
I've not not found anything.
I've not found any need to change away from the maca coffee maker that I have.
But my son has.
Has been doing the same sort of thing and going through all sorts of different types of coffee making
air oppresses and things of that nature.
So yeah, it's it's a thing.
It's a thing.
It's a fact that process of finding what you like best.
Yep.
And in another the following episode 2124 repairing a cloth shopping bag with a sewing machine,
JWP, I must say I was very disappointed with this show because he did not explain how a sewing machine works.
He did not explain how a bobbin.
He is exactly like me when it comes to operating a sewing machine.
Is there and it works good and if not 100% sure how it works, although I did see a video years
back on it.
I must route that out again.
But no, I digress.
The over and back stitching to do the cross stitching was it the fixed stitching fix stitch.
That was interesting, but really really needs somebody to do some introduction to sewing series.
It has to be a series.
How to refill a bobbin.
How to what sort of what you should look for what you shouldn't look for.
It I completely agree with John.
And sewing is and using a sewing machine is definitely a hacking thing.
And we I'm shocked and amazed that we happen to have a full series on HPR about that as yet.
Also missing see above.
Yes, yes, I agree, I agree.
I've found this fascinating attribute.
I was thrown by the fact that he pronounced the make of the sewing machine Genome.
And I thought that can't be right.
No, no, you don't say the final e do you.
And I looked it up.
Yes, you do because it's Japanese.
So I keep my opinions to myself.
It says the Japanese were Genome.
So my daughter has the same has a has one of those as well.
But I didn't know clue how to use it.
John's mother again.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
John's mother really set up John for life there, didn't she?
Yes, yes.
I have three sewing machines in this house.
Don't use anyone.
Yeah, that is I need to be learning, I think.
I went down to the local sewing shop to ask the lady, you know, could I do you have like training and how to use a sewing machine?
She goes, yeah, we do a wedding day afternoon at the three o'clock.
And this wouldn't happen to be for you have anything for adults, adults, adults wanted to learn sewing.
Yeah, me.
I'd like to know how to use the sewing machine.
Oh, yeah, well, you can bring it in and we can show you.
Yes, but would be awesome.
I suppose I could maybe track down some YouTube videos, but it would be nice to have it here in HPR.
Yeah, I agree, it would be very interesting.
And Alpha 32 was on a roll this week, this month.
And he did another show, my mobile recording solution, how to do decent audio in my creeper van.
And he uses a Plantronics USB headset, Chromebook Linux and audacity to record on the go and works very well, if I may say so.
I do not know what a creeper van is.
Sounds very creepy to me.
That was that was my note to myself.
What is a creeper van?
And I haven't really come up with an answer on the parade.
I'm googling as we speak and I'm getting YouTube videos.
Creeper van pictures from photobucket.
Grim Reaper somebody wants me to subscribe to a newsletter, of course, because I've been to the website so often.
Okay, we will go to the next episode, maybe Alpha 32 can do a show on what a creeper van is.
And the following day, his new old tablet, how we got the croft of a LG GPAD 7.
And he got this for a dollar.
And I think on the, where was it on the goodwill was it?
Oh, no, no, no, he got it as a, somebody was giving it away on a, on a telephone subscription, then perhaps.
Can you remember, can you remember Dave?
I don't remember either, I'm afraid.
The terribly sorry about that, Alpha 32.
But by gosh, he never said no, huh?
That thing must have been bugging the, bugging the hell out of him for a long time.
But he eventually got the thing forward.
And I'm tempted to do the same thing myself for some tablets that we have here.
But again, it's, I really, when you go down the road of, of breaking, of not breaking,
but putting firmwares on some of the Americans, some of them don't, and some of the Americans, some of them have fork.
And then it stops breaking.
It's really a, a frustrating, frustrating road.
But I was so glad at the end to hear that he got, he managed to get a new, new firmware on there.
Yes, quite a lot of dogged determination there, which was, but was impressive.
Exactly.
Okay, the following day of 21, 27, tabletop gaming,
Klaatu Ponder's analog programming and tabletop gaming, which is they lead into his series.
And it was a very, very thoughtful, audio essay, I think, on tabletop gaming and why you should do it.
This was the one, this was the episode actually that I was thinking of when I said that I'd found Klaatu's approach quite inspiring,
thinking maybe I should rethink the whole tabletop gaming thing.
I thought this was, this was quite a very well put together episode.
The boy does make good arguments, doesn't he?
He does, doesn't he?
It does indeed.
And John says, game inspiring.
It takes time to play a good analog game, how days where it takes two people.
But I agree with the author that it is well worth the time.
It allows you to be more creative in developing your adventure when today's narrow computer, then today's narrow computer game stories.
I downloaded a darker cold game and planned to see if I can encourage other people to disconnect for a while and have some fun.
Enjoy the podcast, looking forward to the next show.
And I was thinking about that, that our children here quite often will modify the rules of the game, you know, to avoid the nastiness of or to make it less competitive or to make it simpler.
And I've just struck by the approach to comparing it even to an open source game to just an analog game.
There's nothing to say that you can't do that.
You don't need any particular skills of the new imagination to be able to do that.
And, you know, go for it if you can.
Yeah, I'm fascinated that my daughter, who is currently university in her third year,
part of the process of learning to be a student has been to get heavily into D&D gaming that sort of stuff.
You know, she wanted all these fancy dice for Christmas and that type of thing.
So, you know, it's obviously an area that could one should encourage them in, I think.
It's a D&D was something that I always wanted to get into, been to a few and hung around with those, the people a lot, but never really had the most confess that if I would really get into it, I don't think it would be something that I could ever get out of, you know, that's just where the danger I thought about.
Yes, yes, yeah, good point.
21, 28, various glass bottle cutting techniques, again, operator, and again, a nice episode about cutting glass would have liked to know why he was cutting the glass.
And a few photos would have been excellent as well, I thought with this one.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Yeah, yeah, I think he said he was using them for glasses for drinking.
Yeah, that was the image I had.
I wouldn't swear to it, but it's what he said.
Okay, yeah, it would be nice to see some, some of the tools and, you know, after pictures would be excellent.
So, the next day, we had GNU Ock Part 2.
We examine how Ock works, records, feels, printing, and program files by your good self, Dave.
And, you know, contrary to what I was saying, this is a brilliant series and your show notes were very explanatory.
And just as by the by, I happened to be in a different, I happened to be preparing for my son's birthday party while listening to this show during the week at six o'clock in the morning.
And I was happily able to follow along without listening to, without reading the show notes.
Although I did feel a lot more comfortable when I had read the show notes, if you know what I mean.
Right, yeah. Well, the intention is that you do do that.
And hopefully you go back and reread them, you know, just to refresh your memory and that type of thing.
So, good.
Excellent. And Alpha 32 said, but just to finish off, that comment is that I think it could also be Mike's, I use said, I can grab the whole time.
But the first time I went into it, I just, it was like, you know, copy and paste programming this worked. I had no idea why it worked.
And now you're explaining to me why the said part works and now why the odd part works. So I am really appreciated of that.
So maybe for other people, it would be more difficult to follow along without the episode notes. So it's hard to know.
But anyways, Alpha 32 says textbook question mark. Mr. Mars, your series on all said, et cetera, are brilliant.
A bit dense. I'm having to come back to these with a notebook and more time.
Also, are you publishing a manual or textbook to go along with this? Wouldn't that be, wouldn't be a terrible idea? Thanks for your excellent work to which you replied.
Sorry, noise is off suddenly to which I replied high of 32. Thanks for the compliments. I'm sharing the org series with be easy this time since we're both keen to talk about it.
Just wanted to highlight the fact this is a joint effort.
And your styles seem to match very well. So yeah, we have a little bit of a conversation about where we're going next.
We don't have an overall plan, really, which maybe we should have done, but we're sort of conferencing about talking over email about where to go for the next step and so on.
So I said, you'll have noticed I like writing long detailed notes. I got into the habit of writing explanations of things when I started working in IT and kept a journal of stuff I'd learned.
It probably followed on from my science education where we were encouraged to keep a lab book of what we'd observed.
Soon after I started running an adult evening class in Pascal and wrote a series of handouts for my students that go into a textbook at the end of the course, it was intended as a resource that they could defer to and learn from outside.
So the work that I used to generate show notes, producing HTML from Markdown allows me to turn on an EPUB generation stage.
I tried it out for some HPR episode. It wasn't happy with the results. I could look at improving this if anyone's interested and could recreate EPUB format notes for the said series, for example.
It's not a textbook of such, but it should be a comprehensive set of notes about the episodes that could be read on a PC or tablet.
And as I said earlier, that is something that I think will be the crowning jewel in HPR achievement, that sort of detail, having EPUBs and stuff for some of these series, not all of them obviously, but some of them that you've got everything that you need in order to grasp these tools.
Yeah, well, hopefully so. Maybe we can have had a brief word with Be Easy about that idea and he's quite keen on the thought for this series. So we'll see where we can go with that.
And Tlatu demonstrates how to perform one git push to two separate repositories. So you set up your gate remotes, origin and food, you create a new remote, encompassing the target existing targets, adjust your SSH config and push all head.
Tlatu or somebody else really could do with a whole series on git because I think we're just getting the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what git can do and how it works.
Yeah, it's a big, big, big subject. It's, yeah, it's not something I would want to take on myself really, to be honest, because it's so huge, but yeah, it's quite right.
It's the scope for loads of people to contribute to this. I would certainly like to hear other people's experiences of it.
Yeah, it's my use of git is entirely down to a episode that Tlatu did on it on the new world order. And I would love more details either via the new order podcast, which is the zone or here in HPR ideally.
So anyways, that was it for the review of the shows and we had then some other stuff coming through on the mailing list and we had a few comments to all the shows.
Shall we do those first? Do you want to do them? I mean, shall we do them?
We're, because we were talking about comments this first. And might I just say I really like the way for comments on the previous shows works. It's quite nice.
Yes, yes. The only thing I fail to do every time is to go and open those comments so I can read them.
This was the first one was on 2059, which was more tech less magic by Todd Mitchell. And this was about his children growing up gaming technology and and stuff like that.
And Silvoy says really enjoy the episode. Please record some more. We couldn't agree more there on SSHL certificates how they work by a hookah.
I had met the comment that it was illegal or you know, it wasn't it's different in the EU, but that it is illegal since the computer company owns the computers said if it said or sorry.
My original comment was that I'm not a lawyer, but in the EU it's not permissible to intercept all communication, even if there's a policy in place about non personal use of computers.
And Clarke said different in the EU dropping in the control without having heard the conversation yet and Sweden, which is in the EU.
The company I'm currently contracted and pretty careful about dotting their eyes crossing the lawyers tease and they don't believe they would risk doing anything else illegal.
They intercept TLS traffic, but I don't know if the store anything or if it's just counterfilter to work and get things thrown away that makes the difference.
Google Chrome uses OS certificate lists. So if you are the company issued compute windows computer that has the firewall TLS CA certificate installed to facilitate interception.
Google Chrome will accept the CA just as if it were real CLA Firefox won't because it has its own list that is incredibly scary.
They part about the Sweden thing is if they used any of that information to it is I still don't think that it's legal.
The interception is probably okay, but they would need to it would be interesting to ask somebody a foster on the legal track about that that's something that we should pursue.
You should always work on the assumption that if you're in somebody else's network, they have everything anyway, but I'm not sure that that's allowed what they're suggesting is allowed.
I don't know I'm afraid.
I think I will if we're a foster and we have time, we should nip past or ask Bradley cood and fire them off an email to see who in the EU will be able to answer that sort of question.
It's interesting. Who the thought we'd get interesting questions here.
So the last one was make files for everyday use by John Colp and I think John was commenting whoops.
And this show is how John uses make files to you know in his lily pond and HTML projects to automate the results.
John commented that to to a comment by Feeb who was explaining about the dot phony target.
He said, thanks for the info. It's funny. I guess I could read info pages myself, but normally I just look at other people's make files for examples and never really understand what they're doing once it all works.
I'm happy bit of trial and more error. So I'll read my comments. I commented on that because like John's a chance comment there saying copy and paste program.
We've probably all been there. I believe the practices called copy and paste programming nowadays.
That is, you know, looking at somebody else's thing and grabbing it without fully understanding it.
I've certainly written make files by this method.
I've tried to learn more about the subject by reading the GNU make manual, but it's hard going.
I'd say it's certainly a subject for a series of HPR shows.
Yes, yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.
So that was it for the comments, don't you think, Dave? I certainly do. Yes.
The discussions on the HPR mailing list were mostly as a result of the some guys are going with to do a pan network table, HPR pod notes and joe heck.
So far arranged for a table at the OLL, which is Ohio Linux Fest.
Did we ever get a new banner? If so, who has it? Basically, there's a HPR kit, which I think we need to revive desperately on both sides of the Atlantic and, you know, an unease of continents that they may be regardless of their size in order to go to shows and events and present HPR.
And I really like the idea of having a pan network table, so the pod notes and various different shows represented and I was hoping to do something similar.
I put a proposal forward for FOSTEM in the new year, where we will go as HPR, but have other podcasters join us.
And it is very important to do that because that's where you meet actual techies and people who will contribute to your show. They are your target audience.
So if there are people going to events and can represent HPR, that would be a brilliant way of giving back to the community.
I think we need also stickers and stuff printed off. And it's on my list of things to do. Hopefully I get to it tomorrow, Dave, if you can remind me to put the images up on the websites again, the logos and the banners and make it clear to people.
Joe actually had managed to get it. I don't know if I can say it, but a very, very big donation of cops for HPR to give away at the event and basically just volunteer them and downloaded the stuff and met it available and printed it off.
Everyone wants to put a shop together of HPR shwaggers or stuff for I don't want to be involved in gathering money for any of this because then you have to do accounting and billing and all sorts of stuff.
So in the past, if somebody said, yeah, I have the ability to run off some stickers. And if you want some fires, send us over some PayPal money and I will make that happen.
That's kind of the way I would prefer to do it. So if somebody is is doing off a batch of stickers, then yeah, put it on the mailing list and we'll get the word out.
And if you've got a PayPal account and wants a few, a few shackles to make that happen, let's, let's make that happen. But really would like us as a project to get back to being at the shows and boots and stuff. It really increases our presence.
Yeah, great idea.
Yeah. And the other show notes were are the other things in the news topic were trying to locate the banner in the US, which I'm not sure Joe sent in a code for sale that come who's got a podcast and he's working on making it creative comments friendly. He's already put up a nog feed.
And once he does that, we will then look at those cops, aren't they gorgeous?
Nice. Yeah.
That is, that is some excellent work there by, um, we were very lucky to get that as what I'm trying to say.
Yeah, yeah. I think I think many people saw them and went, whoa, how do I get one way?
Indeed, yeah. It's not so easy, but they do look lovely.
Yeah, cool. Nothing, nothing says, uh, awesome, like a cop. I don't know what it is about about stickers and tech, but there's lots of people who work are, you know, collecting stickers on their laptops now.
So, yeah, let's, let's get more stickers done and, uh, and that's sort of fine.
We, um, just on the banner business, we know where the, where the UK banner is. Yeah.
I don't, I'm not sure the answer to the US banner, but maybe you do.
I don't, and the, uh, it's not 100% clear. There's still some people talking offline about it.
Um, so not 100% sure where that is. And there's the, um, they also had a recorder as well.
We're recording device for recording shows, which is something that we didn't have in the, um, in the UK, um, table booths.
That's right. Yeah.
Probably make an EU banner booth as well or a one that I use myself when I go around to shows.
So that would be super, I think. So, Dave, do we miss anything else at all, at all, at all.
I don't think so. I think we're pretty much up to date with everything.
I'm just trying to think now if there was something I wanted to say to people.
I forgot to mention that, uh, John Culp had, um, had said that he was going to try and come along and join us tonight, but he had, uh, a work commitment.
And it looks like he, uh, he couldn't make it, which is a shame, but hopefully he will be able to some point in the future.
Sorry, I was out again.
John Culp was going to join us, but he, uh, he didn't, he didn't manage to unfortunately.
Okay. No worries. No worries. We, uh, we struggle on and we have, uh, hopefully a new host in Kiddigi, at least a new listener.
Um, so we'll see how it goes. Okay, Dave. Okay. Okay.
We will now end this recording with the traditional singing of our national anthem.
Join us now and share the software.
Or not.
