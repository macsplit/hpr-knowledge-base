Hello, heck of a public radio, Brian in Ohio here.
I'm still out from under my rock working on the long wheelbase recumbent bike that 80
Carson on his website recycled recumbents give his plans for and tips and how to make it.
In the first episode I talked about getting the parts and the ideas behind why I would do
this and where I've gotten information from but what I did forget was I forgot to put
some pictures in so in this the show notes here you'll see some of the pictures I want
to include with episode one which includes a picture of one of the donor bikes, the
better of the two.
I didn't get a picture of the large frame bike.
I got some pictures of what I call the dross, the leftover stuff after stripping the bikes
and then of course the gold, the bare frames that are ready to be cut up which is starting
the process of building the recumbent.
I recorded some audio of me cutting up some of the pieces and I hope you enjoy that especially
those of you who listen at 1.5 speed on what cutting up metal sounds like at that speed.
Well, there's no reason not to start, I've got the large frame, the bike number two on
my workmate which is a stand with a locking wooden jaw that'll hold things and a hacksaw
and I'm actually doing the cuts for like a, I don't think it really is an order I'm doing
but what I'm doing is I'm doing the bike number two cut up first just to just to practice
doing some hacksawing and because the cuts here aren't as critical as on the other bike
which is where you're going to salvage the headset of that so it says to start by taking
off the rear triangle starting at the top and so that's where I'm starting.
That's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm going to start, that's where I'm
going to start right now, that's where I'm going to start, you're going to start, you're going to start right now, that's where I'm going to start right now, the !!!
I'm going to put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in the fridge and put it in
all right The first part right so take a picture here and see see where just to show you where I was cutting
I won't record anymore these cuts no sense and you guys hearing me sound
like I'm breaking out of a jail or something I'm going to done all summarized
went well it took about 35 minutes or so and actually the hardest cuts were
the the very first ones that were we were cutting through the the welding
that the company had done when they first put the bike together the cut through
the cuts through the pipe were actually pretty easy. The hardest part was just
finding how to position the frame so you could get your hacksaw in there
pretty easily but yeah so bike number one is cut up there's some pieces I've
got some pictures in the show notes the part that you are going to be using that
you use to make the bike and the parts that are left over including the the
extra rear triangle that allows you to practice the the first of the bending
that is required to to make the to make the bike frame so that's it for the
cutting operation on frame number one number two. All right frame number
one has a number of cuts that are like I said more more exacting because
you're this is the main headset and some of the other and they're the crank
is the bottom bracket is all going to come out of this bike and so there's one
two three four five six seven cuts on this with some dimensions you can see on
page one of the plans I won't grab any of the cutting stuff I'll just
summarize when I'm done here. Okay that wraps up the cutting well that was the
end of that the cuts went fine again the hardest part was cutting through
those original brazed on pieces from the factory but everything else went
pretty smoothly just if you're gonna do this take your time measure twice and
cut once I guess is the wisdom behind that and realize that even if you do mess
up I think there's ways to recover or you probably could find another bike to
start over again I threw in some pictures there showing the first cuts
cutting through the top of the triangle which is that difficult cut and also
cutting through the tubes I have a picture of the workmate that I used
this is the holding device very very handy tool and then I've got a couple
pictures what's left over the parts that are going to be used from frame
number two which is the big big frame and on a picture of the parts from
frame number one which will really are the first parts that you start to
assemble and that'll be in the next show thanks for listening if you have any
comments questions go ahead and email me or leave a comment or if you've built a
bike like this or something like done a project or doing a project to record
it we're all interested in the stuff you do take care bye-bye
