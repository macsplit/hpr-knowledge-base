Let's see if this works.
Seriously now, don't you have better uses for $15,000? This is the open-source Riffindel
radio automation system.
Hello, hello, this is Ork on DK. And this is an HBR episode on the Riffindel radio
auto-aimation system. Now, as a warning, unlike my past two episodes, this isn't scripted.
We're not much anyway. I'm doing this as live because I have the strange idea about doing
my own podcast. I don't really want to be reading from a script for all that, so I'm doing
this kind of like a radio show would actually be done. I spoke about Riffindel in the last
podcast I did along with lots of other internet radio software things, and Riffindel is probably
the most complex of the lot because it is designed for real radio stations, things. You
get software which you have to pay huge amounts of money for, and they're all tied together,
so you can have a suite of machines and a suite of software all doing the editing, all
doing the queuing, creating playlists, all of that stuff, as well as playing back shows
that it can automatically record. Riffindel has all of this stuff, and it's all open-source,
free software running on Linux, I think exclusively, although some things can work on Windows,
I think some of the uploading. So hopefully this will get me into doing podcasting properly.
I want to do something where a sort of a magazine show talking about crap that I like and also
playing some creative commons music. So that's what I'm going to do, so I'm going to play a track
for you now. This is all stuff that I've gotten from Jemendo, it's all creative commons. In fact,
the music that's playing underneath me at the moment, which I'll talk about how that's set up
on the system later, that this is by a Serbian artist called Alexander Blue, which is really
nice as a bit of a bed music. But we'll talk about that later. I'm now going to play you a track
by Brad Sucks, as I'm sure everyone who knows about creative commons music has heard Brad stuff,
and this is my favourite track from his second album, and it's called There's Something Wrong,
which I hope is not going to be what this hot podcast is going to be like. So let's go, let's click.
It seems a little strange, but I just can't explain why I'm tearing out a page and then
I'm sending it all over the ocean, and I've been feeling down lately, ever since I met at your
bay bay, people say I'm making crazy, they say that I'm over emotional.
Oh, well, well, everybody says it's funny, but I can't say it's inappropriate for me.
People come and go, and I know now that you know, just the noises in my throat say I'll take
however long that it takes me. I can't understand why I need to be your bed. I have a perfect plan,
but right now I guess it all mistakes me. Yeah, there's something wrong,
in my life there's something wrong, in my life there's something wrong,
well, well, everybody says it's funny, but I can't say it's inappropriate for me.
Okay, well, that didn't work quite well, playing that and then I got a phone call from the wife,
so I probably cut that out on the podcast, anyway, it doesn't matter. So why am I using
Rivendell well on it to try it out, and it's a bit of a pain to install, unfortunately,
so I'm going to go through a bit on how I installed it, and when I installed it on,
blah, blah, blah. So you can, there is a live CD, there's a few live CDs, I think they,
the software is designed to run on OpenSusur, but obviously it's Linux, so there's also a
Debian package as well, but they're really old versions, it's like 1.7 something, whereas the latest
version is 2.0.3, probably, anyway, something like that, it's in the 2, and I wanted to try out version
2, because it does a few things differently under the hood, and I didn't want to go through
messing about with upgrading it, so, so I am running Ubuntu Studio 12.04, which is the long-term
support relief, which is due out next month, or on the end of this month, I got the daily
installed it, but it's on an external USB drive, which I talked about in my other
HBR episode, and so I can just plug in my external drive into whichever machine that I happen to
be using at the time, and I can just boot up into a, essentially, a live session, although it does,
it writes to the drive, it's like a 100 gig partition on one of my external drives,
which is all very good, so it means I can work it on at work, and I can then come home and
plug into another machine, or even my laptop, or maybe netbook, but I don't think that fits on the
screen. I'm not doing, let's carry on. I picked Ubuntu Studio because, obviously, it has a lot
of audio stuff already installed, so I've got Audacity and Ardore, and a whole bunch of jack stuff,
so that made it a little bit simpler, I didn't have to install a whole bunch of other things,
and also I kind of like XFCE, because that's what Ubuntu Studio has instead of Unity,
but it probably runs quite well in Unity if I try it out, but we'll see.
So I was compiling from Source, which isn't too bad, there's a few things, a bit dodgy,
the dot-configure file had some odd stuff in it, which I need to swap around in for it to compile,
Rivendale uses Qt3, which is obviously quite old now, it looks alright, but it does mean,
when you've got a Qt4-based system, you've got to make sure it's pointing at the right place
for it compiling, so that didn't take too long, I've written a blog post on where I got the
instructions from and the changes I had to make, because the instructions I had there were for
an older version of Ubuntu, my bad music stop, there we go, start again, what was next?
So it uses MySQL and Apache, which is great, MySQL is obviously for the database,
for the music and for almost everything else, the way this is set up is it's all in one big database,
it obviously doesn't store the music inside the database, but it does store all the meta tags,
and a lot of things like scheduling, and the whole setup of the system itself as well,
so it's quite easy to move the setup of one install system to another, back it up,
because it is just MySQL database, you can even have that database running on a separate machine,
and if you wanted to add a new machine, they just have to point to that database on a separate
server rather than having to copy it over onto each machine. And Apache, I understand it used to be
that it would, you'd need to use some system internally to doing its importing, but now it's using
Apache as part of the import system, which might be a little bit tricky because it means you have
to set up Apache and have to set up all those things, but also the reason that they're using Apache
now is because they can use a web-based uploading system so you can create your tracks and
carts and schedules and things through a web interface. I've not got that working because I
managed to mess something up because of the way Apache is set up on different systems, but
got to work on that. That's cool. Jack, the Jack audio connection kit, as it's called,
is obviously awesome and the way I've got everything set up on here is purely down to how amazing Jack
is. I've got, basically, Rivendale has a whole bunch of Jack outputs, assuming that you obviously
install the, you compile it with Jack support, but we've got a whole bunch of Jack outputs and
each Rivendale program can be pointed to the different outputs and then you can plug those
outputs out into whichever system you want. I could, in fact, plug it into individual ports as in
sound ports on the sound card, so if I wanted to use a hardware mixer, I could have the separate
outputs coming from Rivendale out into separate things on the sound card which then goes into
the mixer and then the mixer can go out into external microphones and FM, transmitter or whatever.
You've got a lot of flexibility, but obviously as I'm just running off of a desktop PC and I've
basically got Rivendale going out into Jack mixer, which is a standard mixer setup. You can create
desliders and for each thing and just label them and then plug in all your Rivendale stuff into that
and then have that go out individually to reach the recording and to my headphones and all
that. Play the music and you should have got some more music. Anyway, just a minute.
That's working nicely. Pulse audio is not too bad now with its Jack support, so if I could,
if I needed to play something which didn't have Jack support I could, obviously I'm then reduced to
only having one slider for that because there's only one output. Same with the input as well if I
had to use pulse to do my input on the voice, I'd have to do that. So yeah, what's next?
So the rest of the output I've got, I've actually got two sound cards running because the main
sound card in the machine is running everything that Rivendale's doing, but I've got a USB headset
which I was able to run into Jack separately using something called ulcer in and there's also
ulcer out. It basically creates a separate Jack input and output for a different sound card.
You get a bit of latency on it, but I don't think for what I'm doing, it's perfectly good.
So I've got all this stuff running in and out of Rivendale and into Audacity,
yeah, recording on Audacity. I did ponder the idea of actually having our door running
and do a full-on multi-track thing so that the music, the bed music, the microphone, all of that
is all on different tracks running to a lot of track on I'd or so I could mix it afterwards if I
did mess something up, but I thought that's yeah, that's a little bit too much to set up each time.
So it's just running into Audacity thing recording it as live.
Some other things I've got, well I'll talk about the basic uses of Rivendale itself.
This was me talking about my setup itself, so I'm going to play you another piece of music.
Another bit of creative commons from Jim Mendo, obviously I picked something French which
is going to be really hard to pronounce and the track is called Delirion de Planit
by an artist called Lostana David, probably David Lostana and she's thinking about it.
Okay, but I'm going to play that. It's a nice bit of guitar and singing in French.
I should have done this told you last time how long the track was so that everyone who's
completely bored by listening to music and wants to hear me drawing on about something later on
we can just stick to it anyway. So this track is three minutes 45.7 seconds which is great,
this tells me right in front of me. So you'll be able to skip forward about three minutes and
listen to me drawing on about what I can do with Rivendale. Okay, let's go.
Bonjour!
Every time we see each other, they wake me up and I go back to where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I came to know that every night, the design model is full
I'm like my girlfriend in Paris
Look at me, I'm lost time for the colors
But I'm not in the same reality
And in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm not in the religion, not in the diction
I'm not in the world of dreams
I'm lost time for the colors
I'm not in the diction
I'm lost time for the colors
I'm lost time for the colors
I'm not in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm not in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm not in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm not in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm not in the same planet, I'm still in a world of dreams
And I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
I'm back from where I come from
That's why I wanted to come to the end and I was young
I found all the best
You're experiencing Riverdale, radio automation
OK, right, I'm back
And I've changed the bed music
So, let's have a talk about what I can actually do with Irvindal
And what I have been trying to be doing while you're listening to me droning on
The main part, the main playback
Part of Riverdale is an app, my application called Airplay
And basically, it's a very touch screen safe
It's a nice big chunky button, so if I had a touch screen I could be tapping away
And it has got, Tom, I'll include a picture in the show notes
And you can never look at that
Besides you've got the main playlist that you're going to be doing
And you've got nice big green buttons as they start next to them
And it gives you all the information, you know, the artists and how long they are
And if they're playing it will show the little progress bar going along
A nice thing is at the top you've got this big green circle
And when you haven't got anything playing it just as it's there with nothing on
And it becomes a clock basically it ticks along and shows you how to glance
How much longer you've got until you need to play something else or start speaking
It gives you a countdown after 20 seconds to go
But also each track, if you go in and you set it up
Each track can have a point on it where it says you can start talking now
And so we can also count down to that
So you can give you any different colour on the pie chart on the clock
It will tell you that
That's very neat and really good for DJs who've got a lot going on all the same time
It's because they can show you that
It's got a clock on there
Which actually has the actual time to just read that off
And next to that you've got a thing which can tell you when the next automatic track is going to start
The way it works is because radio stations are obviously time sensitive
You can set this all up so that things will start automatically at a certain time
It's like I'm looking at a clock now and it's coming up to six o'clock and it could be that I could set up a track
Towards the mic and start playing at this time
And so it will tell me that it's going to do that so you better start talking quickly
And finish off what you're doing before this thing starts again
It can also set it up so that each track is scheduled to play at a certain time
But you can tell it to do it all by manual
But it will also tell you how far behind in the schedule you are
And how much time you have to make up
If you're ahead of schedule as well it can tell you that
And so you can add a glance to work out
Okay, I need a track which is four minutes long to fit this space
Obviously I haven't really done that with this podcast
But I work on working on student radio and things like that
So I'm hoping to use this software to do it
And that's going to help
I'm rambling again which is great when I'm doing this live
So let's play about on the right hand side of the main airplay screen
They've also got customizable buttons so you can play stings and idents
And things like that
Okay, the bed music stopping so I'll be able to show you this
I've got some buttons which I've set up now to some sad effects
So grenade
Lovely
I've also got the dramatic boom
Drama
And obviously these buttons can be set up with anything
I could set it up with music which is what I've done with the bed music
So the music is behind me
I can just click that
And it starts playing the bed music from earlier
Stop that
I've got like a thunderstorm behind me
So it sounds like I'm on a dark and stormy night
Anyway
So that's neat
One of the really cool things
Kind of cool
Obviously this is based on old style
Yeah, that's not the thunderstorm
That's the music
Okay
Old-style systems where you'd have a cart for each piece of music
So this big sort of multi-track tape
Which you'd then need plug in to the system and you'd play it off that
Of seeing, now we're all digital, we can have whatever we want
Each song is on an individual cart on the database
But it doesn't have to have just one piece of music in a cart
Or one sound
What you can do if you've got a whole bunch of commercials from the same person
You can have the like multiple takes, multiple versions of that same commercial
And you can click on it and it will play one
And then later on you can click on it again
And be sure that it's not going to play the same one
It will play the next one on the list
So for example the Rivendell radio automation
He's almost a commercial sting
Which I've been playing a couple of times over the podcast this thing
The best radio automation system you'll never pay for
Rivendell radio automation
Now I've got three of those
I know all assigned to the same button
So if I press it again, seriously now
Don't you have better uses for $15,000?
This is the open source Rivendell radio automation system
So that's the other one
And so there's three of those
And it will play the main order
And then it will loop around every time you press it
So you could have a set of commercials
And you can be sure that you're not going to play the same one twice in the same hour or whatever
So that's all set up
And then you can have, you've got like a grid of, it's five by five
You can color them, you can set them all up by that
They flash when you press them
But then I can have multiple versions of this panel
I can just click and switch to another one
So each show, if you want a radio station, each show can have a different set
So if a particular DJ likes his silly noises
You can just set them all up once
It doesn't have to set them up again
When else we got here
That's the sound panel
The right hand side of the, of airplay also has a way you can set up the logs
See what you have played and what you will be playing
Is the playlists set up
And it's all ultra complicated
You can have some auxiliary logs as well
Playing music that doesn't turn up on the left-hand side
Anyway, let's skip on a bit
Because this is maybe too complicated for me to just try and rattle off of my top of my head
See, it doesn't say I play
Importing music can be quite easy
I mean, it's got a, there's an application separate app for your library
And you can do the normal sort of importing
You can set up normalizing, cropping the tracks down
Putting in more than one track into the carts
Which is, that's quite easy and straightforward
But you can do, if you had a massive load of music you wanted to import all at once
You can set up a drop box folder on each machine
So you can look for a particular type of file in a particular folder
And it will, if it sees it, there's a demon running behind
Which just imports it all at once and pops it in
Obviously, you are kind of limited to
If you've got decent ID3 track tags
Which is what it gets its information from
So you might be better off doing it one by one
At which point you can also set up
You know, when's the save time to talk during a track
So you don't go over any singing or anything like that
And all of that stuff
So that's quite neat
There's a whole bunch of stuff I haven't properly got into
The way it puts up your playlists and your logs for each show
Each time of day can be automatically generated
You've got like a scheduling wizard which you can set up
I want this many tracks in an hour
They need to be between, you know, about this long
And then it will go through each track that it's got
And create a playlist for you
It'll even let you avoid having like three 80s tracks in a row
And by using tags on each track as you've imported them
And so the system itself will know I don't want to be playing
Aha, three times in a row
Not that you'd want to
But you could set it up that you do
You just want 80s tracks in this hour
Interspersed with a commercial
So it can be set up to be completely automated
It doesn't have to be a DJ tour
That's quite cool, I need to get more into that
There's a system called Voice Tracking as well
Which allows you, when you're creating your playlist
The logs, they're not limited to doing one thing after another
With no overlap
You can set segues so that it fades between the two
And also you can set up a separate file to play
Sort of between the two tracks overlapping each one
And you can set that up in the log
You can even record your voice directly into the system
That's something I haven't really done yet as well
But it's so... yeah
I mean I'm not regretting using it because it's very neat
And it's just practice using it
And that's one problem I think they've had
Is that generally it's only radio stations using it
And so therefore the people who have set it up
And things like that have set it up in their particular way
And so it's not really a cookie cutter thing
You can't just install it
And hope that it works
You have to really work at it
Which is a shame because it means that it's a lot harder to get
Up and running just to show someone that
Look, you could do this so easily
Anyway, that's a digression
I'm a little...
It's taken me a long time trying to get the document...
Getting the right pieces of documentation to get it installed properly
Anyway, I've been talking for a long time
I shall play you another track
And then have a little talk about some of the more advanced things I admin
And some of the database stuff as well, if I think of anything
Anyway, so let's have a go with that
This next track is by an artist called Tanya T6
It's called Pieces Fly Away
And they're off to Mando, it's about four minutes long
And it is pretty generic R&B fluff
So if you want to skip forward four minutes I wouldn't blame you
Apart from it being a break from my droning nasal voice
Which I'm sure I'm going to get sick of when I listen to this recording
I've been recording for 35 minutes, lovely
Okay, this is Tanya T6, Pieces Fly Away
Go!
Fly away, fly away
I just want to fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
I'm on and I thought some of dreams can't sleep at night
So our picture of you and her future seems bright
I wondered what would it be, what could it be, what would you do
I feel so lonely and what is a girl to do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to, I want to change lanes that you go
I can keep chasing when you give up on time I go
I need to shake it off, got a long way to go
I'll know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to, I want to change lanes that you go
I can keep chasing when you give up on time I go
I need to shake it off, got a long way to go
I'll fly, fly away, fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna throw the rain running from the paint off
I'm gonna not feel the wall
I'm gonna do my things, I'm going insane, my past and my past
Oh, wait, I'll go from here, my past and all on the wall
I can't breathe, I'm a respiratory, I'm about to shut down
Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, I wanna, I want to change lanes that you go
I can keep chasing when you give up on time I go
I need to shake it off, got a long way to go
I'll know, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to, I want to change lanes that you go
Fly away, fly away
Let yourself fly, fly away
Fly, fly away, fly away
I don't know how I'd feel like crying ever
I don't know how I'd try to move stuff
So I don't know, where do I go?
Do I stay?
Man, so do I
I feel so mean to you
But I just wanna fly
Fly, fly away
Fly away
Let yourself fly
Fly, fly away
Fly away
Not yet, that's enough
I need you to take that when you can butasta ma go
I need you to take a long way to go
That's enough, that's enough
I need you I need you take that when you can't go
But I just wanna fly
Fly, fly away
I just want to fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away
Rocksteady, dependable radio automation, built on the proven Linux platform
You're experiencing Rivendell radio automation
There we go, right, enough of that fluff
Well, they're going to talk about, oh, like, okay, so the admin interface on Rivendell is quite cool
Because the database doesn't only hold all your song info and your actual radio stuff
You can actually manage your users, so you can have separate users logging into different machines
You can actually manage on each of the host machines
Each system can be managed using the Rivendell system rather than trying to do something with the Linux system
It's got its own thing all over the top and it's all on the same database as your music
And you can manage how these hound hardware is hooked up to Rivendell itself
You can manage all sorts of things, how each program, each application behaves
Lots of things like that and it's very neat because it means that if you do have your database on the separate machine
You have multiple machines all logging into the same database
And get their settings from there so you don't have to mess about too much
And my sequence is quite easy enough to transfer
So that's neat, there's a whole bunch of stuff in the admin
You can set up all sorts of reporting systems
You can back up the database, store the database
Different things like that, so that's quite comprehensive
It's a bit ugly in Qt3
But it works
I'm quite liking the way the system just sits on top of your Linux system
It doesn't matter what you're running
You could have different machines running Suza and Fedora and Ubuntu and things like that
And it wouldn't matter too much because they weren't going to work on top of it
And presumably if they were to port it to the Mac or Windows
Which is always possible, I mean Qt's multi-platform anyway
If they did study up like that, you could have a Windows box running off the same disk of the same information
So that's that, as I talked about a little bit, the web interface
I didn't get set up properly, but I think it's more to do with how Apache set up on different disk rows
So next time I do a full install of the Rivendell I'll start from scratch and try and do it properly
There's also a whole sort of interesting macro system
Which allows you to send sort of commands across the network to each individual machine
So it can send messages to there's a part of AirPlay
There's a little box and that can flash up messages
Obviously that can be in real time, so a station manager can send a message to the DJ
Or even it can be on a time thing
Like having a cron job flash up a message to you on a terminal
It's this, the scheduler on the system can actually remind you to do something
Like remind the DJ or remind whoever's using it
That's very deep and there's a lot of stuff
It's all nicely learnt slight in that it's got lots of scripting
And things like that, lots of potential to do some really interesting things
Yeah
Sorry
Sorry, you couldn't hear that
That's an interesting thing actually
That mess up has reminded me
With each panel, each sound source
You can have one, you start something playing
And then you start something else playing from the same place
It can be split into two jack outputs
So it's like just then I pressed the button on the panel
Which is playing the bed music
And it started playing it on the second track
So it meant that you couldn't hear it
But I could because it was usaning into my headphones
Because that must have been hooked up somewhere
But it wasn't hooked up to the recorder
So that was fun
So it was just finishing off one bed music
And trying to play the other one
So I had to stop them both
And then start again
That probably didn't make any sense to you
Oh yeah, but anyway, live
I'm going to be brilliant at this, aren't I?
Okay, so let's have a look at this
So I've got three more tracks in music
I don't know how I managed to do too much there
Oh well
I was going to talk a little bit about podcasting
Obviously there's a lot of podcasts
Just about every podcast these days
You like to do their stuff as live
Essentially and broadcast it
So you've got jack
So as long as you set up something like Dark Ice
You can have that
You could broadcast whatever you like out into Icecast
So I'm probably going to be able to do that
Assuming anyone wants to listen to me
I think I might think about using our door to do the recording
Because it means I've got my separate tracks
And it means that it'll sound like it's live
But the multi-track thing would help me a lot
Especially when I'm mucking about like this
And I'm doing it as live
But it doesn't sound very good
Yeah, I could cut out all of those
You know, all these ums
Anyway, anyway
So that seems to be working
Right, as I started this
It's feeling a lot easier to do once you start talking
I tried to start in this three times
And I used to get tongue tied
So this is a third time a third time a charm
I won't play any more music
Because I've got three more tracks there
I could, but my third's hurting anyway
I'm sure the wife will be home soon
Right, okay
So that's
I'm going to leave everything in the show notes
That would be to do with Rivendell
Rivendell audio
If you Google for that you should be able to find it
It's really neat
And I think one problem is that
The documentation is basically a wiki
And it's not great
Because there's several pages on there
Which are just copypaste from forums
So you're hunting around a lot
Obviously I haven't had enough experience in it in order to think
I'm sure there is plenty of documentation on things other than Rivendell
Like open suzer which is what the main developers develop it for
They probably got great things for that
But Debian and Rivendell it's not quite as good
And it would be great if more people could look at it
And maybe looking to using it
For podcasting
Especially live podcast
Because if people are doing things as live anyway
It might be nice to try and use a system which is designed for live broadcast
Or stuff
There is a really big manual operation guide
But unless you're going to read it from cover to cover
There's really nice tutorials
Not many anyway
And when they are there by other people
They've stuck it on their blog
And if more people could be doing that
As like official documentation
It might be nice
There's also a lack of screencasts
At least on YouTube
But I did look around
But I couldn't really find anything
So that's something I might do
But it's very tricky to get into Rivendell
Because it's so vast
There's so much stuff there
And I don't have enough trouble explaining it to myself
And I don't do you lot
Anyway
I think I'll wrap this up now
If you want to get in contact with me
Go to orcondk.com
Which is a-u-k-o-n-dk.com
I've got a crappy little
A landing page
It's got a link to my new blog
Which is on a separate
SiteBlueDriver.com
Which is where I'm going to put all my projects
So yeah
If you want to chat to me on Google+, Twitter
Occasionally
There's links to everything on orcondk.com
So
You lot have a nice day
I don't know who I'm talking to you necessarily
You probably already turned off
I bet no one's even listening anymore
And I'm probably- I'm not even going to put this out
If you want to listen to it back
But I'll probably make myself do it
Oh
Okay, links in the show notes
Especially to all the music I've played
Because I'm- obviously creative comments
You have to give attribution
Ever think was
You either buy essay
Or buy
I didn't do anything which is NC
Because
I saw big trouble with that
I just ignore anything that's NC
Um
Anyway
Yeah, I've gone quiet
Okay, that's- it's time to stop
How a great day
And I hope you enjoy the next episode
Of how I can public radio
