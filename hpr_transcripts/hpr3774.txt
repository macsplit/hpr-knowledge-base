This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3,774 for Thursday 19 January 2023.
Today's show is entitled Emergency Show Posted in 2014, Chump Car Report.
It is hosted by David Whitman, and is about 25 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is, the racing series for $500 cars.
Hi everybody, we're really short of shows at the moment, so I've had to take this one
out of the reserve queue.
If you have shows, can you please send them in?
Because HPR as a project will cease to exist if we don't continue to get shows from listeners
like you.
So David here, I'm at the Chump Car World Series in Portland, Oregon.
And this is a Crap Can Racing Series, $500 cars.
Two, I believe, six hour running events that is happening here.
I was here yesterday and gathered a bunch of car sound audio.
I'm at the Chican, and the idea here is to get as many laps as you can.
You can hear the cars going around.
It was dry yesterday.
It's raining today.
And so everyone's tiptoeing around.
I did some timing on the track.
And yesterday they were running about one minute, fifty seconds around the track.
And I'll do a little calculation on that using some of Charles Sayers' calculation knowledge.
And figure out how fast that was.
And today I timed one car and it's running about two minutes.
So not that much slower, ten seconds slower.
It's about a two mile around track.
But the purpose of my broadcast today is to get some sound clips out for open audio
to have some racing sound clips as some cars.
I will tell you, it's fairly exciting here.
The Chican, it's a generally S corner.
It comes off on a dry day, a hundred mile hour straight.
And a 90 degree turn, another 90 degree turn or more back.
And so the cars are deaccelerating.
And even today, though, there's some passing going on in a Chican.
And some of the cars that are running here are some VW rabbit golfs
that are pretty exciting looking.
They're on three wheels as they go around the corner.
And most of the cars are small.
Honda Cords seem to do really well.
The Rabbit Golf, VWs, the Serranco isn't doing too bad.
The big V8 cars, the Thunderbird and a big Dodge Day tonal looking thing
with a wing on the back, with the number 43 on it.
It hasn't done all that well.
In fact, it's not out today.
There is a 260Z or not it.
Maybe it's a 260Z.
Some Honda Cords and some BMWs.
So, and some Mazda Miatas.
The best sticker cars around here are going to be the Cords.
The Honda C-RXs, those rabbits.
There goes a 66 RX-7 right into the wall backwards.
He did a slip right on the end of the straightaway as he's breaking.
He's okay in continuing on.
The yellow flag is out, but no big deal.
So it can be exciting what I really love about this race is.
If you have a couple of hours and dollars, you can build a car.
And five-man team and race for about 12 hours.
So you can get some exciting time.
You can look up the rules on the Trump Car World Series.
It's run all through the United States.
Like I said, my goal here today was to, or this weekend,
was to get some audio for Hacker Public Radio to put out there
to where people use it in their audio works and app.
I like auto racing and I was wishing Monster B,
who's a professional race driver, was here to drive a car
with the HBR symbol on the side.
So I'm signing off now and I'll be putting my sound clips
on the end of this.
And thank you to Hacker Public Radio.
