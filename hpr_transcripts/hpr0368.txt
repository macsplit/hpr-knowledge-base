The following presentation, using GPS on Linux with GPS Bable, GPS Cinque and Google
Earth, was given on January 21st 2009 by Mark Christiansen at the Salt Lake Linux
users group. Visit their site at SLLUG.org There's three tools that I want to talk about
tonight. One is called GPS Babel and the other one is GPICSync and the other one is Google
Earth. And most of you are familiar with Google Earth. It's this program here that allows
you to investigate and learn about the world around you. It's just one of the funnest
programs I've ever found on Linux. And with 3D you can zoom right in and we're right around
here somewhere. And with 3D you get the terrain, 3D terrain. If you turn on 3D buildings you
can get those two. A lot of these buildings, well there's a few buildings that have been
modeled in 3D downtown. I think this is supposed to be one of them. Yeah. Anyway it's not
downloading the 3D data but that's cool. It's not the point. So one of the new features in the
latest Google Earth for Linux is that it will import a GPX file. So I actually had my GPS
running all the way down here from I live in Utah County and I took a few pictures along the way.
Unfortunately I didn't bring my card reader the one that I need for this camera. And so
we're not going to be able to use this data.
Probably GPS and we can look at how to get data off the GPS. Now this is the GPS I have in
there are several brands and manufacturers and models out there. There are several features
that I like about this. This is a Garmin Vista HCX, a high sensitivity receiver. So it doesn't
really have to be out in plain view of the sky like this to get a good reading. I take this with me
skiing all the time. And I just put it in my backpack and it's at the top of the backpack but it
tracks where I go all day through the whole full day. All the runs that I do when I'm when I'm
snowboarding. And let me see if I can pull one of those out here. Now I have a Facebook account.
I think that's the account I use.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. So here's a day at solitude. Here's a day at Park City. It's yellow. It's not as easy to see.
Here's a day a couple days at Sundance. This is easier to see because the lines are everywhere I went that day at Sundance.
And it's pulled into Google Earth. So this is just a GPX file that's been pulled in straight to Google Earth.
So let's see if we can do that with this GPS here.
So one of the nice things I like about this GPS is that it has support for a microSD card in its battery compartment.
And with a setting that you can be set, it says not only do I want you to store it in your native format on the GPS,
but I also want you to store my track in a GPX format on the card. And it's an open format GPX is an open standard.
Okay.
So there's the logs for every day that I've had my GPS turned on.
And we can take today's, just drop it out here.
And there's actually a problem with the GPX format that Garmin writes to their card. For some reason, Google Earth won't import it directly.
So that brings us to our first tool that we're going to be using to analyze this track.
Now, if I go to Google Earth here and file open GPX, and we see that right there, I click open.
Oh, maybe you know it might have opened it up. Let's see.
It did. Okay. So maybe in the latest version, I fixed it.
Okay. So what I've had to do in the past is that Google Earth wouldn't open up this file format. There was some inconsistency with the standard or maybe it wasn't pure XML or something like that.
So GPS Bable will talk directly to GPS's and transmit data from the GPS, or it'll take any type of most GPS format, native format files, and convert them to any other format.
So if you have say a KMZ file or KML file from Google Earth, but you want to use it in your map source program from Garmin or in top of from National Geographic or something like that, you can convert between the formats.
You can do really cool things that change the line width, the color, whether the line is clamped to the ground or elevated off the ground.
I have a friend that's a pilot and he goes flying and when he imports his track into Google Earth that's clamped to the ground, when in reality he was at 2000 feet or so.
So he can elevate the track and say show it to me above or where I was actually flying.
You can actually do that here.
You can manually right-click on what you can go over here and property is and you can say else too you can set it here as well.
And if you look here, it's actually elevated off the ground and you can change that to wherever you want.
But as I was driving, I was pretty much clamped to the ground.
Okay, so this is the track that I took getting down here.
From right where I live, here in Orm, drove to I-15 and ran point of the mountain, around I-15, around here to the U.
And what I really wanted to do was take this other program and create a CAMZ file for you that would match up the track that I just did with the pictures I took, but I don't have a card reader.
So I don't know if anybody came in late if you have a XD, XD card reader.
Who's run the best file ever?
Yeah, that's okay. I actually got a data set already that I created with a friend last year when we were skiing up at Sundance.
And it contains pictures as well as the track log and everything. So we can go play with that.
Yeah, from Panasonic or Olympus makes them.
Yeah, there's SD, which is the micro SD.
This is different, yeah.
And I actually have a multi format card reader, but it's at home.
So I'm not going to help us out today.
Okay, I think this is all transferred. Okay, great. So in here we have the...
I wonder if it doesn't look like the original...
Oh, there it is. So let me get that.
So when it says...
So there's two in here. There's the original one and then it should be getting the process one as well.
So the process one is basically the converted version, the one that I knew would work in Google Earth.
So let's go ahead and take a look at that.
Can everybody see it? Okay.
So now you can see everywhere that me and my friend went.
What would have proved you had a way in a different GPS data?
Well, okay. So the way that the tool works, it only takes one GPX file as an argument.
But it's valid XML data.
Well, the thing is that it defines two different paths, right? And so there's a way...
There's a way to have multiple paths in a GPX file, but I believe...
Yeah, because I believe that you can take a map that has multiple paths on it, multiple tracks, and save it out as a single GPX file.
So there's got to be a way to have two more than one GPX file in there.
The only ones that I'm familiar with are coming from a single GPS and they're all sequential in time.
And so there's no overlap, but you would be dealing with timestamps that were similar.
So you couldn't just merge the two because it would go by date and it wouldn't know the difference between the two data points.
Okay, so let's take this and we'll take this track and we'll take the photos that I have and create a CAMZ file.
Which is Google Map and Google Earth Native File Format.
Well, I'll show you quickly what GPS Bable can do by just looking at the help.
So you have your in-file type, out-file type, filters, and as far as filters, here's the formats it'll take.
These are all the different types of formats that it convert to and from. It'll go either way on all of these.
So it has CSV.
Let's see, there's a Palm OS Native Format. It looks like XMAP.
Easy GPS, which is a free GPS Waypoint Management tool.
It'll do the LOC files from geocaching.org or geocaching.com.
Map Source, which is Garmin's program. It'll also talk Garmin protocol directly to talk to Garmin GPSes.
It'll talk directly to a gel and GPSes and so on.
You can see it's fairly extensive in what it can do.
But you can also do other filters like say, I want out of all this data in this GPX file.
I want all points within a certain radius or outside of a certain radius or within a certain time range before this and after this or so on.
You can do a lot of manipulation of them, of the data points, uses Google.
Let's see, GPS drive, which is the open source, GPS navigation.
GPX, which is the open source or the open format for GPS exchange.
So there's all these different formats of data that you can exchange between.
It's really helpful. So if you're ever in a bind and you have a data set from a GPS or some mapping program,
most likely you can use this program to change it into something you can use.
There's also, there's been a GUI for this a long time for Windows and just recently with the latest release.
There's also GUI for Linux now.
Okay, so the tool that I want to use here is called GPXync.
There's a GUI and a command line version of this.
And I actually packaged this up and put it in the open-susable build service and it's available for a bunch of different operating systems.
I can't remember which ones that's actually building correctly on, but it's just a Python file.
It doesn't really need compiling and so more or less it's adherent.
Yeah, you have to set up the dependencies that the RPM needs for each different distro because sometimes they have different package names
and then file locations, maybe different amongst the different distros and so.
So go search for it in the open-susable service. There's an RPM.
It's old and there's a couple of bugs logged against it that I need to fix.
Mostly with file locations and things like that, but for the most thing, most part it's going to work.
So we can choose the picture folder that we want to work with.
It looks like it's defaulting to where we are right now so we can select OK for that.
And the GPX file, we're going to choose that one.
And icons, we want a picture thumbnail.
We want the elevation of the clamp to the ground and what it says with timestamp.
That's OK. And then the Google Earth's export folder.
Let's make this.
You know, I can't remember if this is relative to the other one, but I think it is.
So we'll just put in Google Earth.
Now, if you click interpolation or interval, if your GPS track has a long time between two points
and a picture appears with a timestamp in between those points, this will interpolate and find out, well, you know, looking at your data here,
you probably would have been in this location.
And it will help you locate your picture's little culture where it should have been, if there's a big discrepancy.
Backup pictures, add Junemes and Geotags.
I've never done that before, but it will add it into the HTML metadata or it might put it in a picture,
in with the picture over the HTML stuff.
Now, if you were out taking pictures and then you get home and you say, oh, man, I didn't change my GPS or my camera for the time change or something like that.
And you're in an hour off or something.
You can go in here and say, I was actually 55 minutes off, or I was, you know, 30 minutes off, so adjust that when you're syncing up pictures.
Okay, so let's see if I can't remember if I had to save settings first or not, but we'll see.
Didn't Geo code.
And I might have been off, so we can try.
Oh, you know what? I might have to actually.
There might be UTC, so let's say.
What's seven hours in seconds?
Well, let's see if it'll do it by hours first.
No, it's not going to get. So what was it again?
Okay, so it's found a picture and it's geotagging it now.
Yeah, okay, so.
Yeah, well, it needs to know, it needs to know where you were.
So it needs to take the time stamp of the photo and match it up with the closest time stamp in the trail in the GPS track.
And if they're off, it's not going to match up. So it's hanging here, and I don't know why.
And it could be that I don't have the time right.
Either way, it's, it works. It's just that I don't have the settings here.
But luckily, I think that when I transferred the data set, I actually had already done this once, so we can take a look at what we've got here.
Yeah, okay, so here's a, let's see, I hope it didn't override it.
It might have.
Yeah.
Let me copy the, okay, so what this does is it gives you two documents when it's done syncing this up.
So it will mark all of your photos with the right time or put all the locations from the track into the photos for you.
And it'll put them into a directory. I believe it's into thumbs. It might be actually in here.
Yeah, and then it'll back up the regionals into a separate directory for you.
So it'll modify the metadata and put the GPS location in each photo for you.
You can create these two files, doc.kml and doc.web.kml, and there are two different files.
The doc.kml can be used directly on Google Earth.
And the doc web can be placed on a server.
So what you want to do is, you can take this whole directory as is and zip it up for your friends on windows or tart up for your friends on Linux.
You can just send it to them or place it on a web server and say, hey, grab this file, unzip it or untie it and then open this file up in Google Earth.
Yeah, you can also do something like this and create an index file.
What you do is, you take your doc.web.kml file and all the graphics and all the thumbs, this thumb directory, as is, tart up and put that onto a web server and untie it.
So it's out there on a directory. And then what you can do is take this and the URL to the doc.kml file out there on the web and put that into Google Earth as an argument for Google Earth in the location area.
And Google Earth, well, let's pull that, I'm not, I'm not, sorry, not Google Earth, but Google Maps.
Let me find out where this is first.
So this is, this is that directory we're just looking at my local on my local machine, but on my web server. And you'll see here that it contains the index.html and the doc.web.kml.
And if we take this URL here to this doc web, which is in this directory here.
Now Google Earth actually goes out and retrieves this kml file from my server and creates a mashup for you.
So now you can see my track, which is contained inside the kml file. And if you zoom in here, you can see that when I created it before when we were using the Google Earth, I said use the icon, the pictures we icon.
This example here is using the little camera icon instead of a thumbnail for the icon. But now I can click on each of these and I actually open up a picture.
And I've noticed that first thing opened up, it doesn't really draw the box very well. But now you can see that picture was taken at exactly that spot.
So what happens is when you turn off your GPS and then drive to another location, turn it back on, it creates a new data point. Well, the next one was, you know, a straight line 50 miles away or whatever.
So you can see here, here we are in Bishop's Bowl. And here we are up at the, up at Bearclaw cabin, I believe.
Looking down on Pro of Alley. And here's some of the friends we were with.
And if you click on the actual picture, it will then fetch the actual, the full size one for you in a different, in a different browser window.
And there I am with my sweaty hair after having boarded most of the day.
You know, for some reason it doesn't catch the decorations, right? And so you have to click on a couple of lines before you get the deconage to show it, right?
So anyway, that's what you can do with the KML file. You can also, so this is how you can do the, use the Doc web one.
You just upload it to directory and then you can point your friends to it and say, hey, here are our family vacation photos in Yellowstone.
You see everywhere you want in Yellowstone in a long way. Look at all the pictures you took.
If you open up the regular Doc file, but in Google Earth, you get this here.
So this is the one, this is just importing the GPX file. The difference is that when you open up the KML file.
I wonder if we're going to have problems opening that up.
I mean, the Doc one, the web one, and see if that works.
Well, I don't know why that's not working.
It's relative to the director that's in, so it shouldn't matter.
Yeah, I copied that directory and all the lower ones intact.
So it should open up, but it's not, for some reason, it's kind of weird.
And it could be that, you know, they were made for an older version of Google Earth, which is the case.
I think I made it with Google Earth like three, something or other.
And so I made it work.
Let's see if this works.
There we go.
I hadn't, so when I recopied them for my server, I put them in my home directory instead of the actual one I was trying to overwrite.
Okay, so now we're in Google Earth looking at the same picture or the same track that we were before.
In fact, let's turn off the other one.
Turn those off. So now we've just got the one that we just loaded up fresh.
Interesting. That's cool.
Okay, so now we have a much better representation of where we went.
With the 3D, you get a much better feel of what paths we went on.
And you can click on here and you'll get a picture to actually pull up the picture, I think.
For some reason, it takes a lot longer when you do this.
I think it's actually pulling up the full size of memory and scaling it down.
So between the D101 and both, you're just going to make your hand clear and picture.
That track will come down to the tree that actually is your track.
Over here?
Yeah, so the town down, see what 9-0-0-840 is.
Right here.
And they're going down, which is the left and the left.
Which looks like it went through the trees.
Do you have that kind of a bit?
Yeah, actually this is actually supposed to be down here.
I will be right below those trees there.
Well, you know what?
I may have done that.
Yeah, I did.
I did.
This is where I right where the lift is.
Right now, I don't know if those are going to want this.
They can get you down in the trees.
That's another one.
If you rotate down in that way, see if it's looking to the shoulder of the nose.
Oh, right over here.
Yep, down.
Follow the 1-9-0-840 down into the left.
Which looks like it can get you to the tree on the left side of the picture there.
All right, down through here.
Yeah.
Oh, no, this is another lift.
Oh, that's another lift.
Yeah.
But yeah, I didn't do this on this day, but right.
See, right.
Down through these trees right here is just awesome.
Nobody really hits that area.
It's usually four feet of powder on powder days all day long.
So I usually hit this area right here and right over here.
So this is a run called snow stake.
Right down through here, actually.
And right down through here, and these trees is a hidden run.
That it's not on the trail maps.
It's called Regulator Manson.
And you go down in there and it actually has a trail sign on one of the trees,
but it's not on any of the maps.
It's kind of cool.
So.
And all of these right down here are all double lax.
And those are really fun on good snow days.
They go down.
They get really steep down towards the bottom.
I think they go over 45 degrees, most like up around the upper slope.
This is all 45 degrees up here.
But just right down here, before you drop into the shoot,
they go a lot steeper.
So probably close to 50 degrees just before you drop in.
And I really hate those runs on when it's hard packer,
when it hasn't snowed for a while, but on a good two-foot powder day.
Awesome.
Just amazing.
So.
Anyway, that's basically what I wanted to talk tonight about.
So I don't know if there's any questions or...
Is it documentation or anything?
Uh-huh.
There's documentation for Google Earth.
It's...
They don't really talk about importing GPX files,
but it's as simple as opening or not.
That works fine.
GPS Bable has really good documentation on its website.
So we can just actually go to the website.
GPS Bable.
GPS Bable.
And it has really good documentation right on its site somewhere.
Docs right there.
Formats.
All of these different formats are supported.
There's a tips and tricks thing too, I thought.
So we're around here.
How was it?
Tips right there.
So tips for geocashers.
There's even a way to set up a script or something that you can set up as a
mind type for your browser.
So when you hit an LSC file, download an LSC file from geocaching.com.
You can add automatic transfer to GPS and do some things like that.
So it's pretty cool.
It's a pretty powerful program.
We'll talk to most GPSs out there in some format or another.
Some of the newer GPSs, or the specialized GPSs, it may not talk all the protocols.
Like, for example, the garment that I use for my bike computer will do other things like heart rate and other things like that.
I think this actually does it, but newer GPSs that come out with features that are specialized for that, it may not include all the features for those.
Like, there's specific GPSs just for aircraft usage, there's specific GPSs just for paragliding, hangliding, there's specific GPSs that are just for fishing.
And it may not handle all of the extra data sets or whatever it may be recorded for those things.
But for the most part, I found it extremely usable and able to convert any data that I've had to use.
So Google Earth is located at earth.gov.com.
And it's closed source, but it's free.
It seems to download it and install it.
They have Windows, Mac, and Linux versions.
The interesting thing to tie in with this with Google SketchUp is that Google SketchUp is the main modeling tool that they use to create the 3D objects that are in Google Earth.
So if you're browsing our Google Earth and you see a 3D building or bench or whatever has been modeled and placed somewhere in Google Earth, it was designed or built up using SketchUp.
Or at least exported using SketchUp because they could have designed it in, I don't know, AutoCAD and imported the DXF file into SketchUp.
And then GPixync.
GPixync is the other program we were using.
And I think I've got the most recent version that I build as an RPM in the open-source-to-build service.
But it still has some bugs and things that I need to work out as far as packaging goes.
And there may be a patch or two that I need to apply to it.
But this is what it'll do.
Here's the interface that we were looking at.
And it'll actually show you, say, show me my current files that I've tagged in Google Earth and it'll actually pull up Google Earth for you.
So here's what it looks like when it actually works.
You can see here, it says found image and writing latitude, longitude to the image and so on.
And then here's what we were just looking at.
Any other questions?
Cool.
You know, we didn't talk about what was new in Linux.
So we actually haven't met for a couple of months.
Actually, we went to a talk in December.
So I think the last time we actually met was in November, I think.
So there's been a bit that's gone on.
Anybody know?
Yeah.
What was it?
Yeah.
Is that the Linux-based OS?
Yeah.
That's the one we've been waiting for.
Forever.
Yeah.
And they were, I guess there's been a lot of excitement about it.
Over it.
Yeah.
There's stocks up to 35%.
Wow.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, people on that, but it is Linux under the building.
We call it WebOS.
And basically the concept is that it's going to be all, you know, technology or less.
Basically, it's going to be raised from Web these days using Ajax and some of those kinds of things.
You know, it should be very easy to port over to WebOS.
Yeah.
They have it as a payment.
They're going to be working on it, right?
They everybody else is doing it.
They do, because it's all kind of pre-release at this point in time.
They had some prototypes.
They put their upper stands and break quickly.
They took them back.
Yeah.
Well, that's a few more now.

Is there a code dimensional at employers?
Who did?
One night about the trial laid off or what had been done?
I was in T-Mobile.
Yeah.
Move networks did too?
About the same amount.
The tech industry in Utah has been fairly good.
There are jobs out there.
Well, the test of that, because I have been
actually a hard worker in the last few months.
Yeah.
And I'm starting a new job next to Intune, so in fact Daniel's my, your greeter, so I'm
okay.
Yeah.
Nice.
Do you have Linux jobs?
Actually, they're actually a lot of Linux jobs.
Now, are you aware of our, our jobs list, our analysis list?
I know.
Okay.
Well, you're welcome to post Linux and open-sertulated jobs to it, and I'll, I can give you the email
address, slug-jobs-announce at slug.org.
No, we have a separate list for, um, mailings for jobs.
And it's, you know, fairly active.
Um, Smith Johnson Post's jobs there, and a few others.
Yeah, and I think it's because of cost.
Companies are looking to say, what can we do?
They'll save us money and licensing fees or whatever.
And, and Linux, no one source tends to be a good answer for a lot of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In the, uh, turned out on that, they had contractor, and they just couldn't afford it.
I'm a lot of explicit person, apparently, that's the contractor.
And so, how do people see that?
Cool.
Or, yeah.
I guess the trick is to come to contractor.
Well, yeah, the contractor part is good.
Like, where do you go?
You press, you have to work it right, so.
And if you don't, but because of the contractor, I said he had tons of work and was like,
I have so much work ahead.
So, it's okay.
And then I'm back.
And I actually know how to sell stuff a lot.
So, Daniel, do you do mostly tech related?
We, uh, yeah.
And since we're all IT, we have applications for the structure.
And, um, I specialize in the construction of the building.
Okay.
Happy new resources.
For jobs out there, you know, you're interested.
Cool.
We've my current year.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you want to bring up here, we can just have people grab them after the meeting.
Raffle them off.
Yeah.
Especially in the economy coming up.
There may be a few of us looking for jobs.
Yeah.
So, um, at some point.
We can just come up here.
Okay.
Yeah.
There's, uh, universal systems on 33rd.
Yeah.
They, they move.
They move down the street.
It's just up from seven.
Yeah.
Somewhere between seventh and state.
Just up from nine.
They might be just up from nine.
Anyway, yeah.
It's a smaller building.
But, well, it's a less height one.
How long do they move about a year?
About a year.
I think.
I didn't never see the advancements.
I just broke my watch.
They usually have pretty good prices.
They actually sponsored slug for years and years and years by hosting our web, our web server
for over a decade, I think.
And their data is really good guys.
They helped build the clusters up here at the youth.
Supplyed most of the hardware for a lot of the clusters here.
And they're really good for service too.
It's been my experience at least.
Of course.
Anything new happening with Utopia or is it dead?
I was still going on.
I mean, I don't see him talking about it, but.
I hope that whoever expands any work.
I don't know.
There's a rest of what's out there.
It's just junk.
Yeah.
Most of the cities don't want to underwrite it.
A lot of them.
Anybody that's not already into it, it's not going to underwrite it.
They're going to break it.
The public is going to.
Yeah.
Especially with the comrades.
They probably.
They got talked out of.
Taking part in the first place.
Well, it's like quest and so forth.
The other are going to come in and cut a big fat hog.
And.
Quite frankly, you know, I can't get high speed quest.
I can't get off a lot of stuff in my place.
Sprint broadband sucks.
I used to have the Sprint microwave broadband until they lost the band.
This thing works.
And I've got this stupid little load of the thing that.
I don't have a good day.
I can get about 40 kilobytes per second.
Didn't.
I did.
I did.
You talk broadband as a replacement for Sprint when they rolled out.
And it's.
It seems to be pretty profitable.
Michael would begin.
You know, broadband.
Yeah.
You talk broadband.
Yeah.
They were actually acquired by somebody else.
I can't remember the name of that.
They were actually acquired by somebody else.
I can't remember the name of that.
About my head.
But.
You can do it.
Is it a regular?
Do you talk broadband?
Sort of.
Is it a regular?
No.
Although.
Yeah.
There's a couple of companies that got acquired by hands.
Apparently there was a hacker released recently for a blackberry.
And if you have a blackberry device on Verizon or some other provider.
You can actually use it as a modem for it.
Yeah.
Or.
Yeah.
So you could, you know, hijack your unlimited data plan.
And.
And you can do it with.
I found out.
Today there was a.
Some credit card sharing companies.
And now.
They had.
Maybe a consequence of about.
And hundreds of millions of credit card holders.
What.
When did that happen?
Just recently.
It happened.
Oh.
It.
Yeah.
It happened.
Yeah.
I think I just read that.
Yeah.
It makes you wonder.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll see.
Does anybody have an experience of Winx sg3 router?
And.
Pretty.
Yeah.
It's pretty.
Well.
Oh, the segment.
I've got.
Basically.
Is someone you can put the card in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It.
Have.
Plas.
Pleas았는데.
It.
A.
Is essential.
No.
An increase.
Guys, this is.
This is front specific.
Can it.
It doesn't look prosperous.
Oh, it.
There.
I'll talk to you after we're done here.
I'm kidding.
Well, I mean, it's just that they've
experienced isn't just work.
I mean, it's not.
I had it in my own one.
I had to use it in my own way.
I'm not sure what I could help with it.
They were just a little rounded.
And then they were wireless.
Yeah.
That's just hard to talk about.
School, I've said a bunch for a while.
Eventually, I guess I won't even move and access
with the motor here for the business room.
What's that?
I'll just use a helicopter room to it.
Let me try to find out a little bit.
Did you know that it's a pair of shoulders
I got hacked?
What a shame.
What did they do to find a shoulder?
So it turns out they had a tiny bit of an open source
software, I guess, when it was a group or something.
It turns out they had somebody
get programmed in an eye frame that had something else in it.
And that was what actually got an access to it.
So it wasn't the open source and seeing that as a bit.
They had to like contract statement and apologize.
What I think that business was going to get something
about CBA data.
Science-dected.
So I'm going to take all the water off of it.
I'm going to take the water off of it.
Oh, there's CBA data.
We're fast enough.
You know what the fact?
Did you think that we're looking for audiovisual equipment?
We're looking for a number of different forms
of ideas that we can take on the desktop.
Very, very knowledgeable.
Or like, you know, according to the industries,
like that, home-to-beater stuff.
And so, you work on it.
Very little time.
Very little time.
Very little time.
Very little time.
Yeah, right around there.
Right around there.
We know absolutely everything about audiovisual equipment.
We've got a lot of my money over the years.
Yeah, I am.
It's just a funding environment.
Yeah.
And it's going to be work for a few years.
So if you want to experience this kind of stuff,
you need the best sales, it's for some helpful person.
What kind of company do you have in your web performance?
The thing is, you know, so my home audio system
is in a full-hite rack map.
I said, well, if you got a rack man,
I got to get rack-macked components.
I mean, come on.
Well, yeah.
I have a picture of my server somewhere.
It's pretty fun.
Be sure you GPS pack it for us and put it up on them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got a full-hite rack for $100 here.
So that was a nice deal.
Well, let's go ahead and have the drawing.
Yeah.
But one about the heck, I think there was a note
that there would have been notified of people who
have not compromised in the states that have mandated it.
So is there a few time mandates that?
I don't know.
You have nothing mandate to put back that we had become
with God Hacker.
They lost a lot of time for something.
And they did the right thing.
Yeah.
And the you, when they had their medical records pack,
they contacted people too.
But it sounded like these guys were willing to do it
where it was legally required.
Some companies are such weasels.
I mean, they don't do the morally right thing
because they don't have to.
Okay.
So the giveaway is a box edition of 11.1.
And then we also have the non-boxed versions
that you can just come up and take.
And we have Fedora.
Core.
Wait.
Core 10.
They don't call it Core anymore.
Just Fedora 10.
Yeah.
Here also.
So we have about 15 or 20 of each of these.
So you can come up and grab one.
We won't draw for those.
We'll only draw for these for this one.
So since we only have, well,
we're going to, I have two,
but we're going to save the next one for next month.
So we have something to give away.
Yeah.
We're going to give one away this month.
So one lucky person will walk away at the box edition.
This contains the manuals and DVDs for all architectures
and the non-open source software as well.
So it's a pretty good deal.
Anyway.
Has anybody played with 11.1 yet?
It's pretty cool.
We've been playing with it here tonight.
But it looks like every other distro.
You know, I'm not sure.
It may.
233.
233.
Ah.
That would be me.
You're feeling it?
Yeah.
All right.
I was like, well, I'm going to try it out anyway.
So that's a perfect chance.
There you go.
And everybody else can just come up and get a DVD anyway.
So, uh.
That's it?
Yep.
That's it.
The van is done.
Thanks, Anna.
So, um.
I'm going to grab one of the door ones.
So I can play with you.
Yeah.
It's a license.
Okay.
So.
There's.
Come up and get a card from.
