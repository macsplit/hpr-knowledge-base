Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio today for February 2019.
Joining me this evening R is even is well I seem to be both of Dave and Dave yes so yes
yes yes yes me trying to make grammar errors around Dave nobody wants to do that guys.
So this is HBR this is HBR Community News what HBR HBR is a community podcast network one of the
longest out there and indeed probably the one of the longest one out there without a wikipedia page
hinting to wink wink anyways subtle hints are not working so we are a network of volunteers who
record topics of interest to hackers which can be anything and we submit them up to a website
and that is distributed as a shared RSS feed and that's just how you get it in your podcast
unless you go to the website of course and in order to make sure that we as a community get some
feedback we do this community news show which is open to everyone and anyone even French speaking
Swiss people if they bother to show up so nobody particularly mind no no just you know surely
we must be somebody in French speaking person in Switzerland anyways so how are you Dave
everything good I'm good I'm good yep yeah nothing nothing much to to report really just the
usual stuff yes okay so in this show we basically go through what's been happening we listen to
all the shows and we give comments and if there's people have left feedback which we do encourage
you to do then we don't have to give us many comments because we can read out your feedback
so starting with and then after that we'll go through they
go through anything that was on the mailing list and and the other business if there was any
indeed so the first show we will discuss was some Yannick the French guy from Switzerland
oh there's there's odd coincidence yeah he just said hi in somewhere in oh yeah he just popped
just popped into mumble actually so he's so pretty good he's on his way anyway this was a
re-edited version re edition of the review of pop up OS which was done on tuxjam
December 2018 who violates our our redistribution policies I'm afraid but we let it go this time
yes yes yeah we did have a small conversation with him but I thought it wasn't with the
the trouble to to make a fuss about it but yeah since 2006 there's a well-known
prepare of open source hardware or Linux-friendly hardware and all of it's completely free and open
I don't know I have no idea if I Yannick would know we should we should drag him in call him in
sat there in the lounge is he can he not come in hello Yannick can you hear us
hello well you're not able to get into the hacker public radio yeah I was asking for permission
before we need we need permission to come into the hacker public radio room yeah I fixed that
right now no I didn't know if you were recording or something oh no just come on in yeah okay we
just spent the last 10 minutes slacking you off for not being here on time yeah yeah yeah my fault
so we were yeah no worries we were talking about your show actually Papa West yes do you have a system
76 laptop no and do do you know if system 76's laptops are all open source hardware etc and yes
to my knowledge there okay cool so the following day we had no comments on that episode it's hard
to get um it's hard to get system 76 laptops over this side of the pond so yeah yeah I would love
to have one yes there are some nice machines there truth be told the following day HPR
community news so this show but for January and there was one comment on there from Brian in
whole hi oh I listened to HPR on my android phone using antenna pod available on F-Troid
and see the show notes and links to the show notes take you to the website great application
yep fair enough that was that we were we were discussing whether all all pod catches
on of the the show notes properly and showed links and stuff I think something like that I don't
remember precisely but he's just answering there I think yeah there was a comment on the
augcast IRC channel where somebody was asking if you could put show notes into the media files
themselves and I recommended not doing that doing it the other way so have the XML and then
have an the media file linked from the XML so do the show notes first and link it the other way
else you get into all sorts of strange issues with strange characters in media files some media
players at least back in the day broke I don't know what it's like now maybe some of you should
check out see how how well that would work it's might be difficult for some people to see them
I don't have a device that can see show notes in in the audio because I just use little
the audio players you know MP3 players okay well to be honest I'm pretty sure most of the people
when what I mean is listening to a podcast is not probably not something you do sitting in front
of a computer or looking at your phone so it doesn't make really any sense to have show notes in
in the audio or even on the on the podcast sure well that's that's how I consume my podcast anyway I'm
driving so I don't I can't read the show notes on the device but then I make a mental note of
you know I have to go to this this podcast website and see the show notes because I want to
see a link or a picture they referenced so I'm not sure it makes any sense to have show notes
on the on the audio yeah yeah then again they all depends on somebody's application there's
probably four or five people were shouting at they at their media player go of course shouting
after computer course computer going of course you said because that's perfectly logical for my
use case what would the accessibility angle be I wonder yeah I don't know I don't even know if
there's a standard for this because I I know that it's kind of for MP3 at least there's a limit of
of the amount of data you can put in there and then is it XML or is it just text files or does
it support HTML or what in the media you mean yeah in the media itself well it's pretty much whatever
you want it's a while if we're talking about MP3 ID3 tags there are text text text text data so you
can pretty much do whatever you want with that yeah that's all right but then you have the
description which links of the show notes and some of our show notes are maybe eight or nine pages
of stuff so what do you do is it yeah it would be up to each individual media player which you have
to also consider might be a hardware device so yeah hard to know anyway the following day we had
SAP HANA certification directory and this falls under the heading of stuff that's of interest
I'm sure a lot of people would not find that interesting but to me I was fascinated by the
restrictions implied required by to get SAP running on on some harder reminds me of my old IT
system days where you had to read pages on pages of that sort of stuff and you then understand how
they make a ton of money because if you're not writing the specifications it's not supported and
an issue you need another license or whatever it's it's it's crazy and you usually find that out
like five minutes after your system yeah yeah it made me think of Oracle and people like that and
all the horrors of having to do with them so interesting of course the next day Latu and
Lost and Bronx talk about character building in the D20 system and there was one comment on that
oh your ruin has just joined us yeah well does my mic work yes it does yeah okay small
favorites great okay continue please to do to says pleasure to listen to this was really fun
episode to listen to and it made me kind of want to play some role playing a game game again the
comment about charisma being least useful staff made me think how it depends on the game being
played and the group someone like some like shooting or hitting or magic missling everything that
moves while others like politics and intrigue probably best to have a chat before the game to set
expectations of what kind of game people are generally looking forward to that's actually a good
point yeah I actually agree with this comment with this comment says that makes me want to play
role playing games again never have the pleasure to be honest and they are they are there's some
so much energy in there in their episodes that you know there you when you listen to them talking
about the role playing games you can feel that they actually passionate about that and it it
shows through the through the podcast and the yeah it was a very interesting episode yeah I agree
with that absolutely they're they're they're very very keen and I know people who are as keen but
I'm not one of my friends that's that's because I'm very very old probably well there's no age limit
on the playing RPG okay I'm just boring then so the following day we have 75 updates for my
Fedora system apparently the following day is yet another rambling drive into work from Mr X
this was yeah his sound quality improved immensely after that tip from
tip of the lapel mike yes I think that was David Lee who commented on Mr X is shown and suggested
so yeah absolutely yeah lapel mike and a pass through a phonic and that makes wonders
yeah just just saying just to show how easy it is to record an episode for HPR and hint
if thank you I'm failing myself here it was an interesting discussion actually because I had a just
my brother knows because an electric vehicle not having a vehicle myself I have very little
interest in it but it was interesting to see about battery life and stuff so yeah pretty cool
yeah it was quite an insight I thought I'd I'd toyed with buying a hybrid if I if I renew my car
before too long or an electric car but yeah there's this factors there I hadn't thought of
yeah like picking the perfect laptop you know yep yep and he told me that you can get
haggis pizza in the co-op which is oh my god that was because Mr X lives in Edinburgh as I do so
so he's pointed the way so I know we're not to go I'm sorry haggis pizza every
that was very kind of it's it's inevitable and the following day my youtube subscription channels from
Ahuka and of all of these I yeah quite a lot of the RV ones while I'm interested in other
something yeah it's a bit bit wet and cold and miserable for RVs around here I did subscribe
to the history with Herbert one which I thought was quite cool yeah when I when this the series
started like I'm going to review my subscriptions kind of if you said I thought well it's not
going to be really interesting etc etc but actually even if it's just one or two you can pick up
some some interesting channels from those listings so yeah things that you know you might not
think you're interested you know and then you just have a look and then it turns out to be
something you can subscribe to yep I think it gives you a great insight into somebody's
interest and hobbies yeah that too yeah yeah it's surprisingly personal isn't it to see the world
through somebody else's eyes in this sort of way I thought it was really interesting the way to
and I share an interest in astronomy with him and it's interesting that we we follow similar sorts
of stuff so yeah I'd like to know more about RVs because I know they exist I've seen them
have driven behind them but I don't know much about why you would have one and you know because they
pass yeah some of them have got got small cars clipped on the back yeah so they're so vast
well what is that all about well you can move your house and go and live for a few months
done in sunny weather and then go back up to cold miserable weather yeah yeah yeah I'd like to
have an insight in some of the living in Scotland the whole place it should appreciate
getting away from cold and miserable weather but that would just begin to another bit of Scotland
yeah after Brexit for sure yeah you'd be all lucky yeah yeah yeah there's no no Europe anymore
come the end of the month then swing to island oh don't don't get me started on that
no okay the next day my software part dear Tony Hughes Ak Tony H12 a H12 12 12 where does that
come from Tony do show on that I see USB image writer open box open broadcast software CD writing
and game yeah he uses a lot of salt test a lot of software yeah and now this you can
you can test software without I was going to say to polluting your your system using
snaps or app images or what's the flat packs so that that's that's something I'm looking into
trying new software like that you install a flat pack or a snap on obviously on the new
systems of course and it's all there it's all contained and if you don't like what the software
doesn't you just delete one file or snap and install the software and your system is just like
it was before and that's really nice in six months time you've got a piece of out of this vulnerable
software system there on your system with no chance to update it with what with the snaps and
happy images and yeah it stops nothing images they all it's like they yes they have a they have
a place and everything but if it's not integrated into your update system you're not getting your
updates so no snaps of that stem cells you don't you don't have to do anything there that
does they update themselves so if they're well I look forward to your show clarifying how snaps work
okay that did well once once you start getting into a discussion about I think it's time
yeah okay very enough Brian a 911 four show shows up it has a 911 engine I check the oil and
the car lives this was brilliant oh my god did you hear the show I love this yeah do more of
these just just and this is a throwaway show oh my god this is awesome please do more of these
type of shows I don't know anything about cars but there was a stuck to my yeah what's next what's
next yeah isn't that interesting that to the sort of detective work and and so on there's
there's so much so much to be got out of that and there's another insight into a different way of
life as far as I'm concerned I don't I wouldn't know how to do any of that at all so yeah more please
I basically know how to turn my car on and off and that's all and drive it of course and this is
the same person who teaches us how to split a block of beeswax I'm I just like to hear more
shows from Brian coming in and also making clay pots and things like that exactly that's
I recall so yeah very very yeah multi-talented person I think he may be suffering from
or I don't think anyone will find this interesting syndrome which we are kind of plagued with
on the network the answer to that is yes people will find that interesting which is the proof
which brings me on to the next day writing web games in Haskell special events and it's beginning
to it's beginning to make sense yeah I agree I agree it's gradually gradually there's the the
mist is clearing I don't I couldn't sit down and write anything but I can see some of the stuff
that he's he's trying to do and how he's doing it this is actually becoming fascinating now because
I'm wondering I just wondering yes I'm following along in 100% fate knowing what not having
clue what you're doing but it seems to be working it seems to be very you just sit and write it
it seems such a different way of programming Haskell yeah I still haven't taken the time to look at it
but yeah and as I said earlier on I'm prejudiced it's something I want to have a look at
and the following day the Laurel and Hardy return lost and Bronx and Latu don't know why I'm saying that
false on RPG calendar to character building modern RPG play styles compared with old school
more was this the was this the edited version with the Twinkle Bell bit in between no no this was
this was sort of outtakes from two seven four three oh yeah you described it
yeah now this this was the one about yeah where they were doing the star finder build
okay cool I like this show as well this is again it's fascinating to me this whole
RPG stuff following day we had the windmill is on the fritz where I use a fritz software to reverse
engineer some a little model village type windmill yeah fritz is really interesting actually as a
free free software to do the electronic designs I like it helps me when I want to use a
to layer breadboard or something I usually go to fritz first and visually see what I'm going to do
before I could try to do it because with this I usually end up with a whole mess of cables and
stuff on my breadboard it helps to have something that's not physical to play around before
laying out the cables and the components I like the way you can you can get three different views
of the same thing you've got the sun diagram you've got the breadboard and you got the
what's that heard on the PCB layer the PCB yeah it's really nice there was a I saw a talk on
past on Hackaday that there's some question about the viability of the project that it hasn't been
updated in a while but there seems to be yeah that's people trying to get that sorted so hopefully
it'll all work out it's amazing yeah I yeah I I think I must have been busy doing something when
I was listening to this because it I sort of squeezed over my head a bit and I came back to it to
listen properly and follow the the links and stuff and I was just blown away it's amazing
that somebody's put this sort of stuff together I'd been wondering how the hell you would make PCBs
I didn't know how you would how you would go from concept to PCB well this seems to be it didn't it
oh it gives you it's probably like you know when you also generate HTML you get a form of
HTML that isn't perfect but it gives you somewhere to start yeah yeah I mean for for the hobbyist
I think it's the main use but obviously there are professional tools that do an entirely
different job but wow yeah let's get my son involved with this he's interested in electronics we
must have a have a go at doing some stuff with this I used to if I may add my sorry now go ahead
okay thanks if I may add my two cents on this there are several open source
editors for electronic design and the better ones also do I don't know what the word would be in
English but yeah that's okay other routing that's it so they they place the components on the
board in a way where it minimizes the number of layers necessary so you can even say I want this
in three layers and and you get another you get another placement of components in a way you
do it in four layers for instance and the output eventually is some sort of a file that you can
send to a PCB production facility that will print on the mount for you in a way your PCB in a
one-off action piece so you can put components on it and try it out kai kai is the best free
open source software to do that yeah that's the one yeah exactly so basically in kai kai do you do
your your electronic diagram and then you switch to PCB view and yes it does you place your
component on your PCB and it does the auto routing for you although you usually end up redoing
half of that but that's another problem yeah that's that's where I like the experience in that
department sorry could there are some more shows on that hint hint that you and kink well I'm not
an expert on kai kai but yeah there must have been a harm to introduce people to it and maybe
somebody said and they're going oh well I didn't think I knew kai kai that well but I'm
no better than Janik so let me do a show well that brings up an idea a very good friend of mine
it has been has been into embedded Linux projects for his work life would last well I guess 15 to 20
years so maybe I should interview him and get some some hints and tips on how to proceed on those
those kind of things no don't do that that would be such a silly idea oh sorry then I won't okay
I won't you just give it to yourself to make a new episode okay no there's clearly no interest
so obviously I will tell you that would definitely not be of interest to any hackers alone
no exactly well if I may draw your attention there is this Dutch initiative of the
it's it's a sort of a event batch with embedded software and applications and it's sort of evolved
over the last two years or something and now they have their own project on Hackaday and you see a
massive interest worldwide on application design in I believe in micro python that runs on this
thing so it's a sort of a batch with a battery and an LCD display well color LCD a colors well it's
not an LCD but it's a TFT probably display and it's it's well regarding the events where these
things are used it's it's pretty popular I've seen that all right yeah I thought it was always
kind of awesome and cool cool yeah obviously record the show yeah it's an end you're talking about
micro python because I was thinking about doing an episode on circuit python yeah today
you do you know that now that you've mentioned that you all know me a show you know if you say it
out loud yeah everyone that's recorded and waiting for it it so that's not yeah you're gonna have one
soon but yeah I got two more to do then I guess there is this one movie where does some sort
of an angel going to earth and it's the last time that he can do that blah blah blah whatever
and he has this this one line of that says you can never have too much sugar and and this is a
case where I would say you can never have too much python so please go ahead yeah agree python's
awesome next next episode the water we're gonna spend three hours on this subject I'm being I'm
being interested in whether or whether or whether or whether or whether we should move to the next
show nice nice with that with it definitely yeah
Dave you have no idea how many times I have referred to this show even before it was done because
this came out of an email originally that's uh Dave how do you spell this
I'm gonna I'm gonna have two decent to bat one and two because I haven't uh it was a way
to go bat one and two I guess um so battery was yeah it was interesting at the no idea there was so
many words something similar so I'm gonna have to go back and listen to bat one and two
yeah english is a is a great language but it's also evil evil language and you can't
read things like this so yeah it's this loads and loads more like this
following day uh xsv for fast csv manipulations um this was the second part of bz's
show which is an excellent tool and he covers some additional commands one of which is format
um the other yeah yeah brilliant brilliant stuff absolutely yeah I've uh I've sent an email to
my colleagues um said hey look at this uh this tool that I just discovered and the everybody was
like wow this is gonna help us yeah I know I know I was my reaction was similar I did a
fair bit of csv stuff when I was working and uh I ended up writing my own bits of pearl to to take
in csv and reformat it and do do stuff with it so like bits that so but this is this is way
way better than anything I've done it's beautiful yeah and the uh the option to fix the column lens
so that there's always the right amount of columns because yeah you know rule 4872 has
some column expected something something you know what is that oh yeah yeah to put in another
comment in there or there was two commas one of which was on escape uh brilliant stuff yeah yeah
and great too yeah the possibilities you had the um uh double quotes or quotes around the
columns and so on just to make uh zero old excel understand what we were talking about
or have it not format dates for example yeah yeah yeah hey I was very alive before actually because
I uh on the very day he was talking about it I was walking into work thinking how the hell am I
going to do that I have all these records that I need to go through and analyze and yes
ma'am catch beer for the rest together yeah exactly very much ta ta ta ta ta ta and after taking a
little swig of leffa random elements in story time lost and Bronx leaders on a fundamental uh on
investigation of the fundamentals of storytelling and this was again with all of lost and Bronx
shows amazingly obvious after you've heard the episode yeah yeah I agree once again it's
something I'm not into uh storytelling or writing books etc but each time there's an
episode about uh from lost in Bronx uh about storytelling I'm just glued to my uh but catcher
because it's once as you said it makes sense but also you can feel that uh is very passionate
about the subject and uh I think it's uh someone can talk about anything if they are passionate
about the subjects and that is knows we'll we'll just you know uh stay stay there and uh wait for
what's next what's next yeah that's a very good point yeah these these are great I do like
like like you I'm not that much into writing stories I don't think I'd ever want to do it but
it's so interesting to sort of see the the fundamentals of it all and and here's somebody who really
knows this stuff talking about it great stuff and there's examples you know sometimes I wonder why
movie you know cowboy's in space why it doesn't work in one instance and it does work in other
instances and you okay it makes sense yeah and it's it's something that you know as I said I'm
not into storytelling or or writing something but I guess if I ever want to do something like that
that's something I will always remember and that would that would be a voice in my essay go listen
to those episodes again and then do your work no it's saying to me you have not loo about what you're
doing don't ever attempt to write a story because it's going to be crap to something that lost
in bronze comes up with not if you go back and listen to the episode yeah okay fair enough yeah
that you apply all the idea then well what you say and then yeah it's gonna work I'm sure it's
gonna it's gonna be a great book yeah we have uh tattoos already told us the secret formula so
all we need to do is just sprinkle it's very dusted you don't the following day we had the
craiglist scam catch and this was in Edward murals or cypher's um privacy and security series
that he's doing like a introduction to security for people and this really first made me very
surprised then it meant me very angry and annoyed how's that well I was surprised that somebody would
fall for this and then it meant me very angry and annoyed that people would go to this length to
just sleazy people who would yeah yeah yeah take people's money it's just yeah horrible
but you'd be you'd be amazed at who and how many people can fall for that yeah yeah it's a shocking
thing it's not that we're sort of programmed to fall for that sort of stuff I think it's it's not
hard to do if you if you're not you know alert to the possibility it's very easy to be trapped by
this sort of stuff so it's quite sad but yeah I didn't hate it a great job of explaining things
and the red flags there said or wouldn't talk on the phone said or named and seen the
legitimate email didn't match sort of you know the classic stuff yeah and I mean I personally
wouldn't have fallen for this but equally I wouldn't have suspected that this was an attack
factor so yes if you have more I look more forward to more of shows from him but I also look forward
to shows from other people about scammers and the like if you have particular scams that worked
tattoo has a comment anyone want to read this so clap two says this episode great episode the
question is how to get the target audience the people who'd be fooled by this kind of transaction
to listen to this I think part of the problem is that people who have fooled by this sort of thing
have no interest in learning about it then again maybe people who can't be bothered aren't the
audience either way thanks for the walkthrough of the investigation it's great to hear an example
of a bototical analysis yeah I think though if you alert the audience to us like I wouldn't have
heard if I heard somebody saying oh I'm adapting a puppy I would have just kind of walked on
but he immediately raised a red flag to him hold on a second or something going on you know
if I was welcome past my my sister and all says yeah yeah I need to send some money to an
Nigerian prince then oh wow you know and now this has been added to a lot of hackers alert systems
to go you haven't see a lot of puppy pictures on your on your computer there be careful
about the scam yeah yeah so I don't know if it's not even a generation problem because
there are some I know my my my parents are a very easy target for those things but I also know
young people would fall for that so it's not a problem of generation it's just I mean we know about
those stuff because yeah we kind of kind of geeks so yeah that's that's something that's known
into in in our circle but maybe just outside of geeks and technical people people maybe you know
it's the people don't know that it's possible or the I know my mom doesn't understand why
someone would do that why would someone try to steal my money yeah yeah so there's no reason
someone would steal my money so there must be a honest you know it's like it's on Facebook so it's
true no it's not and no people are not honest some people are trying to steal your money mom
I don't know who you have the calls but I keep saying to the kids you do realize you're only
a nanosecond from every creep on the internet so keep that in mind yeah yeah and equally you're
only a nanosecond away from a lot of nice people on the internet so yeah anyway the day that followed
brought us surely YouTube subscriptions part two and more RV stuff geeks and tour and
and some of them I actually BBC earth unplugged my son watches that quite a lot I'm subscribed
computer file and I was subscribed to host of forks but it was it's a bit too flashy
bam bam bam what's the word Dave what's the word cramp no I don't know intense you know the
everything is too intense but it's it's not one of the things that I find with YouTube is that
some people believe that YouTube in itself and the things they do themselves is not good enough
because it's not TV enough so they have to try and make it return into TV and that's the point
I unsubscribe because I hate the whole concept of you know the the drives behind TV and stuff and
it's it just spoils the whole thing just just be yourself just tell the story you know it's
amazing how many of my shores involve a camera just looking at people's hands
no idea what you look like well what's his name the Khan Academy when it became very famous by just
a video recording scribbling on a blackboard yeah that's what's over yeah and that's how they started
anyway I just looked at both lists and well due to my relocation to another house I didn't
had a lot of time to listen to the old shows but I just two channels that I would like to add
because I'm I personally think they're pretty amazing I don't know have has everybody ever heard
of the channel curious mark okay now curious mark I think he is working for the the computer museum
in Los Angeles anyway somewhere over there and they so they they video record for instance how to
how they restore something like a teletype model 15 from 19 20 that's five bits and and then at
some point they have a model 20 stop stop stop stop stop stop stop do the show do the show
okay so anyway so that's that's and they also they have a project restoring a Apollo guidance
computer also very cool to see and the other channel and this is a maybe a weird one and I don't
think you've ever heard of it but it's called death death wears bunny slippers and that needs some
yeah yeah I know they need some explanation if you think about it the title is correct death wears
bunny slippers and what it is it's about it's about this guy who in the in the States in the United
States he buys a former missile silo location so it's completely on the ground and it was
well it's not demolished but it was made pretty hard to get into and somewhere in the 80s so
he he he dogs he dogs up enough dirt to to get into the system and then tries to make that into
his I don't know man cave or family festivities and it's a series of videos and it's absolutely
amazing to see it and come to think of it at some point it clicks and death wears bunny slippers
because when these things were actually operating no that's not but you know what I mean
yeah there were occupied 24 hours a day so you had a watch of 24 hours a day inclusive training
inclusive watching inclusive sleeping inclusive eating so at some point during the night you
sleep there and you get into your slippers to go to the bathroom to the toilet or something but
at the main at the same time you're the guy who can get the signal that he should push a button
and launch a missile so death wears bunny slippers this is uh okay that was a waste of a show
right there but okay we'll let it go this time now I can't do it more elaborate no problem
you wanted to say something unique no just uh that uh the detail is awesome it is still
yes yes I've written it down I've written it down sounds great I want to hear more
deleting arrays positional or special parameters in bash tidying up loose ends by Dave the man morris
sister yeah I'm getting tired of saying that this shows our son so I'm not going to see it
yes I uh rubbish I know I know the what did I get from this on deleting arrays Dave do
something I wanted to say about this one but yeah thanks it's the table is quite cool the
explanation you need to put all those episodes on the cd and then sell that to yeah get
to get money for hpr I second that I guess the show notes as a book well yeah yeah I've been
thinking about how to how to collate it all into some form rather but yeah I definitely do some
do that but it's it's not a trivial task so I take a lot bash tips the audio book
yes yes yeah oh yes that might actually be cool to do a video series along with that of each
episode just saying no no pressure you know in between all the other stuff you're doing first
at the follow the moving on yeah yeah yeah film filmed in the the hpr video center some studios
international something like that how to dm glad to explain dm and rpg last and wrong
demonstrate step by step how to build a dungeon yeah this was the think about one yeah and it was
yet again very interesting and the show notes helped because he has written down you know drawn
what he has doing there are some pictures in there which really helps and the show notes are
excellent it remained in me of my dungeon masters times I have never I think I missed out on
not getting involved in that yeah it's yeah it was really interesting where I was at school and then
we had a little group of of role-playing players for lack of bitter word and yeah it was fun
just when I still remember how I I still remember my first game and the first time I was at dm
and yeah lots of good memories I'm a skimp I keep telling my daughter that there's these these
shows are on she she's quite heavily into into rpg stuff and place it quite a lot with her
pounds over the over Skype and whatever and yeah she I keep saying you should do this and and give
us a show but my kids always walk away when I say that yeah mine too funny funny what you have to
make them you know you do a show or then yeah do a show or I get you don't eat money yeah
I don't eat now anyways I think that's that's that's that's probably legal
yeah right I've just pasted those two URLs into my subscriptions dot tech 12 we'll see what happens
okay the following day yeah this was Haskell data types and data actions this is the one that
brought a lot of clarity to me on what's going on with data types and stuff this is really really
interesting how you beat how you build up your data types yeah Haskell yeah I got the impression
that this might have been a response to us saying yeah but but what does it actually mean what how do
you actually store anything and how does it you know what's the persistence layer and where's the
database and things because I'm sure we've said this at some point or other in one of these shows
so it really does help to clarify things it like I certainly got a much deeper insight into into
what was going on with the database interface from it excellent yeah it is it is excellent yes
and possibly one on you know loops and stuff or basic structures might also help a little bit
you know the classic hello world program yes yes but there's there's met a lot of the other shows
make a lot more sense soon we can all put Haskell down on our CVs guys yay thanks to HPR
John Culp cleaned some potentiometers in his Peebly banded 65 I enjoyed this but then again I'm
a into electronics salt I'd appreciate hearing Dave's view of the show I yeah I was fascinated
by this because I have various bits of equipment in this house of an audio audio kind like
cassette player thingy which is also an amplifier whether and they're never to believe the
the potentiometers get crappy and they make horrible noises when you turn them I think I've got a
ghetto blaster in the attic as well from my ghetto blaster days as you do as you do and it
makes the most spectacularly awful noise when you turn the volume control but so and I've never
never actually looked into how the hell you clean these things probably because in their day
it was incredibly difficult to do you just basically threw them away or something but
where you put a new new potentiometer and I found this there's utterly fascinating I like the
pictures too but I don't think you were throwing them away back in the days but there was so
there were built to last and probably your usage would you know you would use it for less
less longer than their life expectancy but now you use them back now and now we know how to fix
those because well we have some HPR shows to tell us how to do that and so yeah I think
yeah those those old stuff that we're using now as as you said retro retro things yeah
yeah then it then it to be fixed or cleaned but yeah back in the days there were there were
built to last like 20 years and you were expected to use it for ten years so you never had to
to change those things but yeah now you buy something and it is programmed to fail in six months
oh yes yes no my so-called ghetto blast to go it dates back to about the 70s or early 80s or
something but it's just one of these they've got the potentiometer on the top and I think that
just muck and dust and stuff gets in in under the knob that you turn and falls into the
into the works of it you know yeah so so I also have an MP3 player my favorite one from
about 2005 where the controls are all gummed up with the same sort of thing and I'd love to be
able to to clean that out so I'm gonna I'm gonna have a shot of this based on what John's been
telling us and what's again an example of someone passionate about something and
recording a show about that and it turns out to be really interesting and it turns out
somebody else was going to record a show about the exact same thing there is literally a picture
on the entitled winter to do list fix this and a picture of a banded 65
speaker the exact same one and it was added on 2018 10 27 by in my bill and yes stepping on
tools stealing a show via plan john all right all right you bet me to a fair and square by the way
there is a contact cleaner that is specifically made for music gear and does contain a lubricant
it's made by DE OX IT deoxit deoxit and I guess and the line of products is called
their font choice on theater looks awfully similar familiar also I would say your saturation
is not working properly if at all that thing should give you the hair metal distortion you could ask
for smiley you might have a problem with the foot pedal I had the same issue in the past you
might be stuck in norm gain and the pedal is switched into lead gain where the saturation is
the problem I used to have is the 90 degree jack on the foot pedal does not retain or grip the
cable in any way any tug on the cable can break the solder joints inside it's something to check out
and it's only a couple of screws good luck and get some hairspray
great image that something to do john with the Lafayette axon please
should I do this one never too much about eighties gears as john
haha sorry bill please do the show anyway I think the foot pedal is actually working fine it's
just that I didn't realize it was switched over to the other channel while I was working on the
and the foot pedal wasn't actually plugged in at the moment I realized my mistake when I plugged
the foot pedal in and stepped on it and suddenly saturation is working because it was on the right
channel thanks to the tip on the cleaner lubricant I think I will check with my audio engineer
faculty guy and see if he's got a can sitting around that I can blast into some into the pots without
having to pay 20 bucks for a can myself smiley face always the best
indeed why not what is vnf I unfortunately missed the open networking conference but
you're you're into next month you know they're candy if you want to be doing now that's
so you don't know that's in whether or whether I should be doing that day or not
yeah I might be changing the weather oh dear right do you have other comments six from the
previous shows one from a show back in what is this 10 is October 2018 the show was portiers by
tattoo and tachy is responsible part of tachy is played by Ken uh three test driving
or do you want to do it Janik yeah okay so test driving Linux in computer stores that was the
title of the comment Alison I've been pleasantly surprised here in Hong Kong that if I ask the
store clerks they would generously allow me to boot from a USB stick to see how well Linux runs
no complaints whatsoever and that's lucky too because let's spring and summer when I was shopping
for a new machine I tried like ten of them before I found one were screen Wi-Fi and touchpad
were working without glitches and the machine didn't crash after a few minutes that is awesome
that is awesome yeah yeah yeah I don't know many uh store around here would let me boot anything
from around the USB key on their on their machines oh I went to the media marked here and they
let me do it they were fine but but I think it was more because one of their older guys runs Linux
at home so it was okay okay he had the talk Rob says on episode this crappy episode about some
AS400 system how you ruined thank you for the talk about the AS400 system I was working on those
magic machines for a decade or so I must say I must admit it was a truly enjoyable experience
thanks again for bringing back good memories cheers uh tree borer ps I don't know how about others
but for me those machines will always be AS400 no matter what the new marketing name
IBM invent for them i-series system i etc etc smarty face to which yeah I feel exactly the same
I feel exactly the same to me they will always be AS400 systems even in generations yeah
so and while on the subject um I will be in Munich at the end of April during the vcf e.org
vintage computer festival europe uh exhibiting and AS400 with uh I think to to connect terminals
so anybody who hears this show and is in the neighborhood is of course very welcome to
visit that location in Munich and uh well have a chat with me for instance ideally on mic
um yeah well an AS400 doesn't have an audio interface actually yeah but you're ready to
remember what it does yeah i'll do something that's called the lapel mic and a mic a smart phone
and there you go what kind of mic is that you can get a like ten dollar lapel mic that you
clip on to your uh go ahead oh okay i understand the lapel for all your clothing yeah okay got it
sorry yep okay Dave can you do the next one as i can't pronounce that word uh okay this is uh
2707 the comment on steg analysis 101 by Edward Miro and uh it's a comment by RTSN who likes to
make titles that consist of a single exclamation which is quite cool so they stand out certainly
and he says thanks for a wonderful episode yeah nice to get some short feedback yes Steve says
to uh tattoo show on uh privacy and security manipulating pdf's with ghost grouped
and he says just what i needed just wanted to say thank you for this episode i needed to
reduce the size of the pdf today and then you write where to come and the necessary commands was in
the show notes worked perfectly you see tattoo show notes do work thank you yeah yeah that's that's
funny because you actually remember that you i heard that on on an hpr episode and then you go and
watch the uh the show notes and uh it's yeah it's it's it's like with everything every episode on
on on on hpr it might not as i said earlier it might not be something you're into or something
that you're interesting right now but then some situation arise and you say oh i heard that on
hpr let's let let me go and grab the the show notes and uh you know look like a hero yeah it's excellent
um tattoo has really started doing uh excellent show notes in the last year or two so
because before that you would know it was on the tattoo show somewhere was it on new world order
or was it on hpr or was it on information underground how now with the show notes at least you
know exactly where it's coming from i'm worried you can get more help so it's excellent and it's also
nice again for you know a show from last December boom i had a problem i heard the show and i
got a fix that's it that is that shows reason for existing absolutely verified and you
want to take the next one yep so it's a comment on hpr show 2737 which was my pioneer RT707
real-tree tape deck by john kup and the comment is by vulcan rider this is excellent i listened to
your RT707 podcast this morning on my way into work what a blast from the past have the RT909
the 10 inches real version of the same tape deck that you have i picked mine up in the mid to late
80s now i am raking my brain to figure out where i can pull it out of storage and setup
sorry i want to go back and listen what i put on some of my tapes comparing traditional music
format lp's real tapes etc to mp3s and aug is like comparing dead tree books to ebooks with books
you have the physical sensation of a paper book the smell of the book the fill of the flipping pages
meanwhile with music not only do you have the spinning tape reels and the movement of the ton armor
but more than that analog music has more depth and richness and is generally a warmer ambiance and
than digital music by the same time i can put several hundred thousand digital tracks onto a device
which fits in my short pocket and only need a pair of headphones to protect anyway it is
james like this show that makes me enjoy hpr thanks john well what an excellent comment
so we shall i do the next one john culp replies the rt909 thanks to the comment spoken rider
very glad to hear you enjoyed the episode i've seen the rt909 that you mentioned in catalogs
and on ebay that would be a great tape deck to have takes considerably more space than the 707
probably would not fit in my stereo rack because it would need room above it for those big
reels to spin i'd love to have one though i believe you i believe the youtube tech
moan host has an rt909 in his collection if you do pull it out of storage and send it up i hope
you will do a response episode about it i would love to hear that so what i
excellent there you go another episode in the in the books you'll be sure
yeah mailing list discussions i guess not a lot no
lost in bronx and taj and platu are going to play a one-shot star finder on february the 16th which
is a little late to join now and i hope that will be a show the game may or not may or may not
become a hbr episode of course it's going to become a hbr episode even even if it doesn't work out
then i would like to hear how a bad night of star finder works out i'm just interested in hearing
both sides cool nothing else and the other business Dave yes um well there's only the the usual
thing about the the tags and summaries stuff we had a contribution from windigo this past month
in february for which thank you very much and we've managed to add tags and summaries to 24 shows
that didn't have them in that period so slow slow progress but we are making progress
thank windigo yeah i really think i need to go back to my own shows and just do them
i also think we should update the host page not to put in all the show notes on it because
they can be rather huge can't yeah especially if maybe if you exceed 10 shows or something
yeah yeah it could do definitely do with some some thinking about i think
you are also you can i think you can shorten the the name i have on this pure
so then that's a unique that would be enough for you no no no no no okay you really can do that is
uh submission you show with it correct information see what i did there i understand that footwork
was very fast i have to say and coming back to myself Dave now after all that it's been a very tough
week this week i must say but uh it was nice to come on here anything else guys that we missed
well i think so no no no well now i've been busy with other stuff and i listened to this show and
i participate a little bit and next thing i see is myself making a google checklist of all the
sessions new recordings that i can make i see myself going to a web shop to to buy a low grade
remote what's it a field recording unit and it's your guys are all to blame of course i recently bought
a book on on on podcasting it's a Dutch book you know from the Dutch guy who calls himself the
podcast professor well i don't know yet if he qualifies for that title but anyway i am this is
and it's all you guys are all to blame if i hadn't gone to our camp and if i didn't get Dave's
business card i wouldn't be here and i wouldn't spend money on on this and i found myself a new hobby
that i really love so you guys are really to blame yeah we get you the freebies and then
well achievement achievement met there i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i was really nice
having you guys on because it uh yeah likeness the mood well it's a pleasure as usual to be there
and uh you know go over the SPR shows with you okay cool um anything coming up that any more
months to mention or not um just just to say i don't know if we talk about that last month but
a camp 2019 is something is going to happen it's later this year remember exactly the day if
someone can just October 19th and 20th i think is it after told my head something like that yeah
that's that that's it such a direct about 19th some direct about 20th 20th 2019 in Manchester UK
so if anyone wants to meet i guess uh are you going i yeah i will be there uh will you be there Dave
i certainly plan to yes yes i can't miss that it's a wonderful wonderful event
and then yeah i know many other from other shows and uh other podcast that we'll be there too
it's going to be good fun so if you want to just meet a bunch of geeks uh talking about free
culture and come to a camp yeah yeah i'm already talking to my wife about it so um better along
yeah yeah i'm trying to um well there's of course this this my new thing that's going to happen
in the UK in some way i don't know the exact date i mean but it's it's world news every day so
let's see how that all plays out i think we can get tourist visas should be an issue
if it happens at all i'll tell you what we all listen to uh you rune you uh we should go listen to
uh hookers RV thing by an RV we go through the channel
picking up Yannick on the way drive up today
yeah yeah well if you go from Scotland to Switzerland back to England and then to
uh to to the other men on the road and the Netherlands that that's going to be a long trip
yeah but it would be a very it would be much fun
yeah yeah that's for sure it doesn't sound it yeah yeah sort of an international beer trip
yeah yeah yeah i see i see i sense that more people interact getting interested
well when you throw the word beer in there and instantly that gets more interesting
definitely your purpose i do want to ask people to start submitting some shows because uh the
the entirety of next month has been provided more or less by platoon so um if platoon lost in Bronx
and some of the other regular hosts so we are unfortunately relying very very heavily at this
moment on contributions from uh well-known hosts so what i'd like is if you i've never submitted
the show before if you could please just record a show say hi my name is Mary and i'm a
thingy and i want to do a show on hpr but i have no clue what to say and here's
the story of my life so far if you can suggest some shows that i can record
that will be awesome you can submit that to us that will be great then you're past the big hurdle
of the first show and then we can all suggest shows that you could send in to us so if you do that
well that would be absolutely excellent yeah and it's as easy as pressing record on your
mobile phone recording app it is people overcomplicated but that's how simple it is
okay tune in tomorrow folks for another exciting episode of yay hacker public radio
