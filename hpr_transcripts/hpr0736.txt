Hello and welcome to this edition of Hacker Public Radio.
My name is JWP and I'm on the internet if you type in JWP Linux, it will come up with
my little humble thing that I have for the Linux.
As you know that I try to do about one Hacker Public Radio episode per month.
I try to do it about something that I wouldn't normally talk about in my other podcast.
And what I really really want to talk about is the amount of whining in general that I've
heard about, according to 1104.
Okay now granted you know especially listen to you know Brian and Chris at the Linux Action Show
and godly I wish I could come up with something you know that high of quality and they gave
that much enjoyment to that many people but you know to listen to them whine about 1104 and
all of the things that you know you know I didn't do or didn't do and you know for you know
Ubuntu to take the step and say you know what we're going to give something as free
as in beer and as free as in freedom to every living person on this planet as an alternative
to what they have to pay on you know for windows or as an alternative for what they have to pay
to run a Mac it's pretty amazing you know and granted you know the unity thing I've been using
you know GNOME 2.24 for quite some time and yeah it's uncomfortable for me and when they move
the X's to the other side yeah I wasn't a big fan of that either but at the same time I wasn't
out there whining to someone who was giving me something for free right and you know I think that
you know if you really don't like it then you know that you know open susah
offers still a really really clean GNOME 2.24 if you want that you know simply Memphis also has a
pretty clean you know distribution if you know if you're not a KDE fan or just go slack with GNOME
you know you don't need to do all this this whining this whining about this you know
Linux Men is right there and you know I run Julia and I think it's a fan most fantastic thing
that I've ever seen but you know Ubuntu is you know pays the bills you know canonical is a
huge thing and you know because I because I work in the enterprise space I know that red that red
hat in and susah and the enterprise space are about to get some real heat from Oracle and their
open source products and with open source support so it's it's feasible that Ubuntu might be the
last band standing a canonical might actually be the last band standing so to criticize them
you know when they're saying hey we're gonna make something and it's for everybody right and
if it's not for you then to switch to that classical mode and do 2.24 in the classic mode it'll
be there for six months or stick on the LTS I mean to get it to do this concept whining and
I've seen so many people I mean even on the outlaws it was a little bit of whining and I think
and so I go was out there doing something on the floss weekly whining about this it's it's just
you know really really you'll want into the people that pay the bills right unless you're physically
contributing money every month to open source projects and you shouldn't be out there whining
about it you don't like it switch it's just the way that that goes all righty well I hope you
