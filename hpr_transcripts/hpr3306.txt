Hi everybody, my name is Ken Fallon and you're listening to another episode of Hacker Public Radio.
Today, it's Hacker Public Radio Community News from March 2021.
For those of you who are new to HPR, this is a summary of what's been going on in the HPR community
for the last month. All this information is available on the website and it's useful even for
older hosts to go and have a quick read of the website and make sure that everybody knows what's
going on. The HPR Volunteers, myself and usually Dave, who can't join me today, are the ones who
basically post the shows when you press the OK button and process comments and stuff.
We do this under the guidance of the HPR community via the mail list and we make sure that once
a month we give you an update of what's been going on and make sure that every show has got
some feedback due to the nature of HPR can take a while before feedback comes in.
So the idea here was that one month would be the longest you need to wait for some form of feedback.
Last month, we had finally one new host, Tim Timmy, who took advantage of our narration option.
If you, for any reason, are unable or unwilling to record the show, you can always send a script to one
of the HPR folks here and we'll find somebody to narrate it for you. Worst case scenario,
we can also run through text-to-speech engine. So that's Tim Timmy. Welcome to him and now we will go
through the last month's show. The first show was HPR Community News and there were zero comments
about the show. Nothing controversial either was said apparently. Then some guy on the internet,
excellent, excellent handle, Mosay was on about the HPR laptop with AMD Ryzen 3 mobile and with
radio graphics and Frank posted the comment using your OEM Windows key in a VM. Hi there,
I'm afraid to have to dampen your expectation. These days the Windows license key or at least the
OEM ones meaning those that are imposed new when you buy the hardware is usually tied to the
hardware for that means i.e. the BIOS or whatever chip. I don't think it will be accepted inside of
VM. Your best bet for the drive will be to pop it into an external case and use it as mobile storage
or as a backup drive or at least bear or at least bear if you have a hotswap adapter. That's
what I did with the hardest drive that came in my thinkpad when that arrived five years ago.
I only did one short boot-ups because I was curious about Windows 10 so I had my first
and for many years only contact with that. I then swapped the drive out for third-party SSD
also from crucial straight away. Regarding your RAM particularly, I'm not sure it sounds like
those missing two gigs are siphoned off for the internal graphics.
The next day we had the Hitchpure RPG Club reviewing Dead Earth Escape from reality by pretending
you live in the dystopia. Dead Earth is an RPG game published under the GNU documentation license
and I will say I really enjoy these games, game reviews even though I may not be that into the game.
Introduction to GDB, a really friendly introduction to GNU Debugger. This is also by Tlatu and
it's part of the compiler series. Let me just go back and make sure there were no comments on the
tabletop gaming or another word and there were also no comments on this. This was a nice introduction
just into compilers and how the work I don't do a lot of compiling myself and it's good to see
these introductory shows being put on there so that you have at least a feel for what's going on.
Next day we had upgrading Lubuntu on my Samsung N150 Plus netbook and this was submitted by
MrX and walked us through the entire process. Also no comments on this but I will comment that I
recently just dug up my old Acer Spire 1 G5 model and it was literally the most perfect form factor
for a small PC. Just slightly bigger than an A5 notebook, sorry A5 notebook and keyboard wasn't
too cramped. It has a better keyboard than a lot of the Chromebooks that there are now.
I can definitely see why it would be worth your while digging out some of these old laptops and
use them as just a SSH to something devices. The following day we had a Tim Timmy episode
supporting the wire guard showing how to use wire guard to as a VPN. This was a show that I've
been asking him to do for a while and technically he put it together and we recorded it and got it
out there. No comments on that. For a few comments this month.
Acer 72 sent in a quick tip with regard to cooking and boiling eggs and this one I did not
know. Perfectly peeled eggs. If you want to know what that is I recommend listening to the show.
It's very short and you will have a very good tip there. The following day we had
continuing series of the Linux in-laws, Grumpy old coders and David Thomas Martin and Chris
discuss borrowing and basically a discussion various different programming languages. I actually
found this quite an interesting discussion so if you've got a minute no harm to give that listen.
The next day was a show of mine that had one comment and it said monochromic.
Apache control restart versus system control restart Apache 2 service. I've been using
system control restart Apache 2 service to restart Apache but the recommended way is to use
Apache 2 control. Interesting observation as the only difference seems to be a private Tim
clause in the unit definition for the service. I wonder why exactly that made a difference so this was
basically I wanted to have a next cloud on my internal network behind the router but before my second
firewall. The next day we had GIMP more on layer tools and techniques and seriously if you're not
following this show, particularly interested in the GIMP, do listen along because a lot of the
fundamental stats I've been talking about here are applicable to quite a lot of the graphic
programs in general. There's only so many ways you can do it and within free liberal
sort of software anyway they make no bones about trying to say consistent between ways of doing
things. Very good show there and I'm actually looking forward at the end. I hope
that he produces a sort of PDF of all the posts that he's done should be quite easy to do because
he's covered on his own website and just put them into some sort of ebook for the rest of us to
enjoy. The following day we did have another show from Ahuga and the reason we have some host
posting twice this month is because we were very short of shows and people are sending them in
just to remind you all that HBR is a community podcast network and we basically need to have
shows coming in all the time. Don't worry if the queue is full there will always be a few months
where there's nothing and since the pandemic has started we've seen that it's more difficult for
people to send in shows possibly because of the less commuting time possibly because other things
are dragging people's attention maybe you're in front of the computer more and not walking as much
so less time for podcasts more time for videos but if you've got a tip or an idea or you're
writing a bug post then just record it as well and post it up here tag in public ready that will
be great. Okay batch processing three comments on this one so this was interesting.
armacodd.com says audio I think that's operation could be wrong. Using FFMPEG and VLC will get
everything done you likely need and there's a link to the how to speed up and slow down video
using FFMPEG and the key words and it includes a command there and it's quite long.
The most important one is FPS frames per second equals 120.
Gamos says which hardware podcast player did you move to? Hey I was a long time fan of the
Sansetlap as well and managed to eventually kill both of the ones I owned and put rock box on.
When I went to look for a third one they were out of landishly expensive and I couldn't
source out the make a model of the one you switched to. Kevin O'Brien replies the one I brought was
Plan top KL and GTOP which I found on Amazon I just looked and now I didn't see it but I see
something that looks identical under the name AGP Tech. My guess is that they're all manufactured by
Chinese manufacturer Azoiums for various companies and Gamos or anybody else I have some Sansetlips
left over if anyone wants one I think they're all working done what the battery life is like
some of them have got the original firmware and more of them have got rock box all of them are
capable of having rock box on them so if anyone wants one of those give me a shout and we'll see
how we can get it to you. The next day the squirrel free sf blog the trouble with humans and
human beings then floater to give us a very sitting in the kitchen rambling of lots of things including
Global Chroma West and many ten Open BSD and maybe so forth. Some comments here a good question
one of the questions that was asked was possible to use text brace browser to
post to hack a public radio the answer of course is yes yes of course it is because we use standard
boring HTML I just tried to post a show with links can be used to upload HPR just tried and it
works fine if you're leaving comments Zenfroater was commenting that the common system wasn't working
but it is because we get comments we even get comments from dedicated spammers who are
go through all the hoops to try and spammers so if you are posting on a current show which is a
show in the last 10 days then you get you get a difficult question you need to ask answer what
does the P and HPRs done for hacker public radio and that's pretty much it if however you're posting
a comment for a show that's in the future or posting a comment for a show that's in the past then
you need to go through additional questions and the reason we do that for is obviously the ones in
the future are not in the OSS feeds while people browsing those are more likely to be spammers
and spammers tend to go back and pick out a popular show from about a popular blog post from two or
three months or even years ago that you're well used to improving comments on that's something
quite old that people have commented the last one yeah I really like this this is great thanks
this helped me out and they do that quite a lot we get quite a lot of them where they the dead
giveaway is of course spammers if you're listening to this is where they go great blog post yeah it's a
podcast okay so four steps that you need to do if you're posting comments to older newer shows
one is P for public you need to deselect they I am a spammer tick box that will be selected for
you by default so you need to un-tick that you need to go up to the top of the page and
select who the host is for that particular show and then you need to tell us something to prove
that you were not a spammer and I'm really enjoying the ones that we get in there like comments like
you know HPR is a community podcast blah blah blah but some some very nice ones and I said I'm
using watching out for that squirrel is running 32 bit so just something that we know when we
approve the comment that you're a human or squirrel squirrels and aliens of course clutter yes yes yes
fine that you're a community member of the HPR podcast a listener says enjoy the podcast
both the coffee slurping noises and tool clearing distracts from what was an enjoyable podcast
and for someone who mentions his PR is apolitical you spend a lot of time talking about fascism
and cancel culture Kevin O'Brien says thank you a gather you won't see it but thank you for
a gather you won't see it but thank you very kind words I look forward to more shows from you
ties says well I'm canceling this episode you the only valid reason slurping your drink in my
ear at high volume and smiley faces so there we go a bit tongue in cheek there I think
and the following day we had a HPR book RPG not book club no not the book club
guys the book club has been submitted in a while hmm did I hear a show recently where
somebody promised me shows and pretended it was first of April I was in a different time zone
at that time so that doesn't count any who done generators this is Benny McNally and it is a this
one was a simplified I don't know if the word is yeah simple simplified D&D and the recommendation
was this would be a good one to get kids into playing a game of kids so yeah useful if you want
to listen to that I suggest you do update my make kiwi to backup media this was archer 72
and another episode on how he is using mkb to do backing up this time using a raspberry pie good
episode actually archiving is very close to my heart as well I do buy a lot of DVDs so that I
physically own the media and then have that on the nas available to us in my previous show where I
put on cloud or sorry next cloud behind my ISP's firewall the only way to get an SSL
cert from let's encrypt was to do it using the DNS TXT method and that didn't allow automatic
update so I was a bit concerned that my cert was going to run out and how it was going to renew it
well natural fact it's quite easy so that's what this show goes through and it's only
yeah three minutes long that's including the intros and outros spam bot honey pot implementing
honey pot spam style filter for your HTML forms is quite interesting uh great show Kevin
O'Brien says I really enjoy these shows where people show how they can defeat the bad guys I hope
there are more worst stories to come um there was yeah the accessibility of the form came into
question so if some of our uh screen reader community members could have a look at the sample
included in that and see air quotes what is if there are any issues implementing the accessibility
using this method next cloud application updating tojess implementing a cron job and this one
is on my tick list to do seeing that I had done a next cloud episode and it is basically run once
week uh an update command uh very cool some guy on the internet did a show called about poisoning
the well shut down the negativity in our community and windy go agreed saying well said I never
understand why people feel entitled to attack those donating the results of their hard work
if I don't feel like a piece using a piece of free software I can skip it and support the ones
that do so an interesting um thought uh discussion there on supporting you know when is the
right time to give constructive criticism and when is that crossing over into negativity very good
show some some good shows come there out of uh out of that next day make your linux harder
ever wanted to know about up armor and se linux yes I did and this actually turned out to be a
very good introduction to it nobody says other msc implementations in the episodes you're
can quite sure if there were other msc's for linux beside the se linux and up armor as
and indeed there are there is smack which is quite uninteresting as it's just another labeled
base msc similar to se linux to me the interesting one is t-o-m-o-y-o which started as a patterning
file based similar to up armor but later it started differentiating between applications based
on their process invocation history this means you can apply different policies and say
slash bin sh depending on the chain of execution leading to it kernel pointing to the end pointing
to get it pointing to login pointing to sh vs kernel pointing to the is pointing to ssh
d pointing to sh while this is also possible in up armor it's quite a lot more manual work
and more difficult to reason about t-o-m-o-y-o also has much nicer tools than either
of the more well-known mscs se linux has given msc a bad name as being hard and laborious to manage
if instead of se linux people would be first introduced to t-o-m-o-y-o then they would
probably be more inclined to implement an msc youtube channels for learning spanish was
episode three thousand three hundred something we're not even celebrating we've passed another
hundred and yes fine and this is a list of various different aids that websites that hookah
Kevin is going to to basically learn spanish couldn't be easier to understand the idea behind
the show common European framework for reference languages is also an interesting read if you
get a minute links in the show notes then on the 29th we had the curvil space program game
now i'd heard about this before and i particularly often see hackadee articles where they have
hardware things for controlling this game and that all the same kind of cool it was nice to get
a rundown of the game and operator did that very well also good advice on how to get into the game
or how to skip forward and stuff if you're a new user so pretty good there another another thing
that i have never really come across has been the installation of different language input methods
so to support different non-western languages i guess how you put them in using
chinese moji yuriki ping-win and kanji etc and hackadee has a multi-lingual and multi-keyboard
requirements type household and this was an excellent example of what you need to do to get this
all running and i can understand exactly why he forgets this every time you do it because things
subtly change so that's why you post a show on hbr so that you come back and listen to yourself
telling you what to do uh the following day we had um slackware on the raspberry pie
bump brine in ohio and zen floater too says bravo an excellent show sir some day i will try and put
slackware 13 on my order chromebook and that was that for this month so yes now what we normally
do is how a review of any comments that they were posted on older shows and back about
posting shows to remind yourself to do something this is now the um second time i've gone back
and thanked myself for posting the show on fixing ebook calibrary and pdf crop in this case i
needed pdf crop because i needed to i got a quote from somebody in the first half was
the header of one thing and the part i needed was the bottom three quarters so i took the entire
thing scanned it in cropped the bottom three quarters which was from the third party provider
and not via the reseller so the reseller bit was on the front and then they had embedded a word
document into their thing so their header was in each page so i was able to crop that down
exported as individual jpeg files and then uh do a text to us do a optical character
your wish character recognition thing in order to convert it to a um to a file that you could edit
and both was your uncle macius your aunt and tom indeed is your first cousin well done on the
community news for december 2020 plackay i had a question uh open ldap on bdb i didn't know open
ldap originated on bdb these days i use it on use its own lmdb which has also replaced bdb in many
other places turns out open ldb started using bdb in 2002 and lmdb wasn't ready until 2011
in the middle of the no sql boom smiley face and he includes two links to open ldap and
they're lightning memory mapped databases on swift 110s my thoughts on diversity and linux
and open source uh bjhdnd says get rid of the bad terms in it thanks for sharing your thoughts
and feelings about bad terms in it i've better understood now what what they may cause so
you got me to finally rename the different branches of all the gif repositories in my organization
i'm responsible for i've written an internal blog post about that linking to the hpr
episode hope that others will follow my example wow pretty pretty cool that an episode can make
such a change and i hope it continues to be a change for good um male list discussions uh let me
just see uh call for shows during the week so i had first call for shows from people who were not
regular subscribers or regular contributors and then when that failed i had to put out a call for
show from regular uh from the regulars who thankfully were able to fill up the niche but i'm looking at
they um looking at what's coming up right now in the queue and it's not looking good either
we're okay for next week thankfully um but for the weeks after it's still free slots there
are loads of free slots um right up until uh next month and then after that it's things out
considerably so yeah time to start recording shows just think of your day
are you doing something that other people would find interesting god if you're doing it
you yourself find it interesting so why not just press record on your recorder
and send in the show it can be that easy you don't even have to send in show notes it's great if
you do we really encourage it it makes our life a misery if you don't but you're getting shows in
is the key here and then you can work on your show notes later okay uh that was that what else did
we have for the last month Dave oh yeah subscribers that since uh 2019 i sent you i sent in a
uh basically a chart showing the number of subscribers that we've had for that period of time
and there was a question uh why why did it drop in 2017 so much and the answer to that was
we were experiencing some um issues at the time uh with the upload system but we were also
those issues were as a result of us being de-dust so during that period we were off the error for
appear uh something like a week so yeah that was that uh i think also Dave commented yet we had a
de-dust attack uh around about that time so it's kind of a round about that period
so describing the graph uh it goes from first of January 2016 to the sorry not the first of
January yeah the first of January 2016 to the first of February 2021 and it shows the number of
subscribers to hpr these are the number of people hitting the rss feed within 24 hour period
from a unique ip address i can guarantee you that that is is very conservative way of doing it
if you're comparing it to other platforms and we see that the um the graph kind of went down
2016 uh from uh hover around the 25,000 mark there was a big dip in 2017 uh down to 15,000
and that came right back up uh again that was around the detail uh the following month the
de-dust attack time then between 2016 uh middle of 2016 right up until the start of uh the pandemic
really we saw a gradual growth in um subscribers up to total of 40,000 uh month that has since come down
and erratically hovering around 35,000 subscribers not a month sorry 35,000 um
uh subscribers yes supposed to be within a month within a month period 35,000 people have
subscribed that means of course that those people are coming every day during that period so
on a particular day on any given particular day 35,000 people are choosing to pull down the feed
so if they pull it down four times a day that's still counted only as once
and that was it for the um mailing list
so not a lot of point going to the events list calendar and they've added 10 additional shows
with summaries so if you want to help out there are only 404 left so if you want to be part of
this excellent project you can go to the link in this show and report underscore missing
underscore tags.php and you can help out so uh that was it tune in tomorrow for another exciting
