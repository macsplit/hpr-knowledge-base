one.
Okay, and welcome, hey, I hope
everyone's having a great day. The reason I wanted to do this was I wanted to
talk about the different file systems and I was interested in this and at
work we've been doing a lot with the different file systems and so what I'll
do is a series of notes about the different file systems so the one that was
most interesting is the XT for me so I started with that the EXT and so it's
the original the original file system was introduced with Linux and it's called
the extended file system or this EXT for short it provides a basic
Unix like file systems for Linux using virtual directory used to handle
physical devices and storing data on fixed-linked blocks on physical devices the
XT system uses a system called in-nodes to track information about the file
stored in the virtual directory the in-nodes system creates a separate table for
each physical device called the in-node table to store the file
information so each stored file in a virtual directory has an entry in the in-node
table the extended part of the name comes from the additional data that
attracts on each file the file name the file size the owner of the file the
group the file belongs to excess permissions for the file pointers to each
disblock that contains data from the file Linux references each in-node in the
in-node table using a neat number called the in-node number it's assigned by the
file system as data files are created the file system uses the in-node number to
identify the file rather than having to use the full file name and path the
extended file system or XT was implemented in April 1992 as a file system
created specifically for the Linux kernel it has a made-to-date data
structure inspired by the traditional Unix file system or UFS and was designed
by RemiCard to overcome limitations in the Minix file system it was
first implemented in its first implementation that used the virtual file
system VSS for support was added in the Linux kernel version 0.960 and it
could handle file systems up to two gigabytes in size XT was first in a
series of extended file systems it was immediately superseded by both XC2
and XI AFS which competed for a time but XT21 because of the long-term
viability XC2 reminied many issues inside XT such as the immuability in
mutability of i-nodes and fragmentation
