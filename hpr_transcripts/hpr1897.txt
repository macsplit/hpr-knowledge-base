Hello, this is Swift 110.
I decided to do a recording about Installing Windows 7.
I managed to get an extra SATA drive from a friend of mine.
He was nice enough to give me an old hard drive that he had that needed no more so he went
ahead and gave it to me.
Approximately 320 GB of capacity.
So I say that it will be a very useful thing for me.
Currently this PC that I have is a Gateway DX48, let me see, look at the side because
I don't know where he's remembering necessarily, ah, the side panel.
It is a Gateway Model DX4860 and UB3PP is the specific model that it is.
I bought it in November of 2012 and the original idea I had when I got this PC was that over
time I would upgrade it.
I would upgrade it and it would suit my purposes quite well.
Well, that's actually been what's happened since November 2012.
Here it is nearly November of 2015.
It's been a good long time that I've had this computer and I got to say I'm pretty happy
with it.
It comes with an i5 2320 CPU.
It has 8GB of RAM, DDR3.
Of course being of that generation of CPU, it's Intel 2000, internal graphics, that's
what it was out the box.
I ended up getting a Mac Pro for one of my friends, a 2006 Mac Pro and well the logic board
died on it and I kind of just left it sitting around for the longest time, didn't do anything
with it and I was thinking about selling it, thinking about selling the monitor, trying
to get some money for it.
Well anyway, that monitor, after a long time, I finally decided to, what if I could connect
this to my PC and I discovered it needed a dual DVI graphics card so I could connect
the monitor.
The monitor is a 30 inch Apple Cinema display, it has 2560 by 1600 resolution, it's a really
nice screen, it's just such a pleasure to use, oh my goodness, it's crazy.
We got that going, so I needed a new graphics card, but in order to get a new graphics card
I would also need a new power supply.
So I went to Micro Center as tradition and got a 430 watt, 430 watt power supply, I figured
it would be sufficient for my needs and I also got, was it modular or non-modular?
I forgot, I got a good deal for it, so it's okay.
Anyway I also got the graphics card, I was originally looking for a GT210 because all
I was interested in was connecting the monitor to my PC and having it work so I can put something
I have to use instead of just sitting here, it's a great screen, so putting it to use
is a very, very, very good thing.
So I go to the Micro Center looking for the GT210, grab the box, pay for it, go home, guess
what was in the box, not a GT210, it was a GT610, so okay, pretty much I got the hookup,
holla if you hear me, so not being wanting to look a gift for us in the mouth, I just
went ahead and installed it, could have even gotten a money, one of those mail-in rebate
things, I can't stand those things, but I decided to just, you know what, I got a good deal,
I paid like $25 for it, and I know people are probably making fun of me right now, you're
saying, man, that GT610 is some garbage, like what is this, 2006, 2008, you can do better
than that buddy, why don't you, you know, you could at least rock a 750 Ti, come on, bring
it up to Maxwell, I'm sorry, I don't have it yet, actually with regards to the GPU,
I'm gonna actually get a better one at some point, it's just not a high priority, I'm
able to do everything I need to do with this monitor, I'm not really much of a gamer, I'm
getting a full resolution, so I don't really have a pressing need to upgrade that just yet,
considering getting a 960 or a 970, so if I was to get a graphics card, oh I'm gonna get a
good graphics card, the funny thing is if I get a 970, it'll be almost as much as what I pay
for the computer in the first place, I originally paid about $400 for it, it was another model,
what I did was I was looking at what was available, and like I told you, I always had to go of
upgrading it, I was gonna buy a basic computer, micro-center, upgrade it, do what I want to it
over time, that way I don't have to necessarily have all the money up front, it could just be a
gradual thing, so what happened was I went ahead and bought another model because they didn't have
what I wanted in the Rockfield store, saying I'm going to end up taking that thing home,
which was interesting, and I found I didn't have the right connections for a monitor, really,
so I decided, you know what, I'm gonna go take this thing back and get my computer that I actually
want, the gateway, I bought something else, anyway, it's a pain in the butt going to micro-center,
from DC, to Rockfield, with the computer, kind of really didn't feel like doing it, so one of my
buddies, you know, he picked me up, and I took the piano to the store in Vienna, and I ended up
switching it for what I actually wanted, and got 15 bucks back, so that's not bad at all,
I'm not complaining about that, got home, set it up, Bob's Uncle, so now we're fast-forwarding
nearly three years, and I'm pretty satisfied with the machine, I know it's an older CPU,
but it's good, I can change that out at some point, the only thing now that they kind of got me on
is with regards to the motherboard, it's an OEM model, and here's the issue, the CPU that I have
can go up to 32 gigs of RAM, however the motherboard can only go up to 16, so it seems like I'm
restricted by the motherboard, granted 32 gigs of RAM is to say it nicely, quite overkill for me,
16 gigs would be just fine, and I'm considering getting that as well, so what I want to do with regards
to this computer is to get another graphics card and to double the RAM, I like playing in virtual
box, so that'd be kind of cool, I'm starting off with Blender and getting used to working with that
particular program, I just don't have very intense needs for RAM, so I don't really need
32 gigs of RAM, it's just nice to have the option to upgrade to that in the future,
and the truth of the matter is my issue with getting the 16 gigs, and then I decide later I want to
swap out the motherboard and get 32, is that well, I'll have two, I'll be getting, well I can
probably get around that, because when I get the 16 gig kit, roughly 100 bucks, I might be
able to get a little lower, maybe 80 bucks, probably phenomenal, it's going to be two four gig sticks,
so if I get a motherboard, for example, that has four slots,
then I can put the 16 that I bought, and then get another 16 later,
the issue with regards to the RAM and pricing, is that right now DDR4 is out,
so at some point production of DDR3 is going to cease, they're going to focus on DDR4,
prices for DDR3 RAM is going to go up, I'm concerned it's going to do the same thing as DDR2,
now DDR2 RAM is pretty expensive, I think it will be extremely cheap at this point,
with those machines being old as the hills, but it just doesn't work that way,
demand makes the price go up, I guess they're more rare commodities now, so,
let's just say the price isn't right, for the DDR2, I'm glad I got my X201 laptops that are DDR3,
so I can get past all that nonsense, with regards to this gateway, and there's a lot,
I don't even fully use this capabilities now, but I look forward to at least doubling the RAM,
strongly considering with regards to motherboard, I don't know, I've actually never
taken a computer or well, I've never done that with one of my own computers,
take the computer completely apart, put the motherboard, yeah, you know what, I've never done that,
go all the way down, take the motherboard out, switch it out, and put all my components on,
never done that before, so, I'm a little bit apprehensive about that,
rather not, but I gotta learn to get past all that nonsense, and go ahead and do two for myself,
so, the computer currently is dual booted, for the longest time I just had Windows 7,
the version of Windows 7, it gave me, that was already on the PC, is the home premium,
I would have much preferred professional, could have gave me professional, but they pretty much
got me on the home premium, whatever, it came with one terabyte hard drive, which was a phenomenal,
and still there's a phenomenal amount of storage, I don't use it all,
and having this extra 320 gig hard drive in there, that's a nice chunk,
so, I have storage galore, actually gonna probably use that to back up my Fujitsu
lifebook 4215, because that hard drive is kind of long on a tooth now, so, it's gonna be needing to be
replaced, eventually, I'm gonna hold off on that just yet, but all in all I'm happy with the gateway,
there's stuff I can actually do with it, to put it to work, I find that I use my laptops a lot more
than I use my PC, which is absolutely interesting, hold my word, hold my word, I just installed,
yeah, Windows, I got the ultimate version, it was crazy, and so, now I'll be able to get around
some of the problems that I was having before, the thing about Windows, home premium,
I've been trying to install a game SimCity 4 Deluxe, it's an older game from like 2007,
and it just gives me issues, I run, I install the exact same game on my Fujitsu
lifebook 4215, which is a laptop from 2006, it's a Core 2 Duo, and it runs the game just fine,
it's just on a little laptop, it's 12 inches, I want to run this on my PC, once I run it on my PC,
I don't know if you guys will ever see me again, because I, I almost want to say I'll never leave
the house, of course that's bit of a hyperbole, because I don't like staying in the house all
the time, like going out walks and all that, so I just really want to play SimCity 4 Deluxe again,
reload up my old cities and get back to work, you know what I mean, I love that game,
and having the ultimate version of Windows 7 will make that not an issue, there's certain features
that Windows 7 home premium lacks that are available in professional or ultimate, or even enterprise
addition, and one of them is Windows, I think it's XP, and it's almost like a virtual machine,
within an operating system, that allows you to run your older games with no problem with Windows 7,
that's been an issue for use for me, so getting around that would actually be a fantastic thing,
looking forward to actually getting that going, and being able to play that game on a computer with
vastly greater capabilities than I've ever had before, I haven't actually played the game
with five years, and I played that game when this old Pentium 4, so it's, I should say it's been a
while, and looking forward to getting to it. As I mentioned, I have the cities that I've already
worked on, regions and whatnot, so it's going to be funny seeing what I did years ago and actually
started where I left off pretty much, I've long since thrown away the old computers,
and now I'm rocking a new hotness, old and busted, got down away with, so that workshop pretty well,
I'm so happy to have this extra hard drive, this is proving to be a big boost,
I'm still installing Windows, it's completing the installation, actually this isn't that long,
I'm used to it being a much bigger issue, but I'm hanging in there, pretty much going to wait
until it finishes completely, and then I can install various programs I have, what I'll do with
the original one terabyte hard drive in the gateway is that I'm, is dual blue with Windows 7 on
premium, and Linux Mint 17.1, I want to shrink the partition of Windows 7, and obviously grow
the Linux Mint partition, the machine could quite a bit, and what I really would like to do,
what I could do even, is transfer what I have on there, I might just decide to give the whole
terabyte to Linux Mint, and then the whole 320 gig will be the Windows, that whole second drive
will be for Windows 7, I'm flirting with that idea right now, we'll see if she responds.
I don't know what else to say right now, I'm past a 19 minute mark, I could run my mouth a little
more, but this computer, I'm trying to think what else to say, look forward to playing some city four on
it, city skylines on it, you can tell I like city strategy building games, tropical, I really
want to work in Tril, hello, bad game, I mean I was playing that game, back when,
woo, back in the day when that was younger, like younger, man I wasn't even 10, wow,
wow, I used to play it at this place called learning smiths, that was located in Georgetown Park,
in DC, it was a mall, you could just go and they had an FAO Swartz upstairs, they had a learning
smith, and I had several computers, good god, I hate to, wow, I hate to, you know,
curious about the specs of those things now, but you could just kind of go there and play on
computers and they had a lot of Broderbund software, played math games, and this one game that I
don't know the name of, but it's like an aquarium simulator, which you can play as different
sea creatures, different types of fish, octopus and stuff, I don't know the name of that game,
it's such an older game, and I'm assuming it's a Broderbund game, but I don't know the name of it,
and I haven't played it since what, 92, so, it's probably a lot to ask to,
you know, but I love to play that game again, I'm probably, it probably doesn't,
it's probably not as great as it appears, just I was a little kid, and this is back when Amazon
Trail was out, Oregon Trail was on, and those were the days my friend, I thought were never in
pop references or crazy, trying to think, but I really missed those stores, the FAO Swartz,
I missed the Learning Smith, now that I'm old enough to actually buy stuff from there,
there are no more, such as life, and I just got to deal with it, you know,
I'm still waiting for this installation to complete, but I'll probably just do another video
about installation further, I'm tired of talking, well anyway, this is Anthony,
actually well, this is Swift 110, and I'm installing Windows, and talking about the specs of my
gateway, PC, you guys have a great day, goodbye.
