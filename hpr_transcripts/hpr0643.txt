Carl brought you guys by the way.
Hey, this is Drupes and this is HPR and I sometimes run a site called hackermedia.org
which has all kinds of really cool hacker media related things and today I'd like to
talk to you about what's on my MP3 player which happens to be an old school iPod that I've
dropped way too many times. I have lots of random stuff on my MP3 player and not enough
time to listen to everything so don't get upset if I don't listen to your show even though
it's awesome and I totally should just assume that I know your show is awesome and great
and I don't need to listen to it because it's just too awesome. Okay, now if I need
to be listening to a show or if it's missing from hacker media let me know. It's Drupes
a Gmail and I'm rarely right about things so I might be wrong about some of this information.
Please feel free to correct me in comments or record an HPR app to you know to correct
me or record one of these and tell me what's on your MP3 player or Og player and maybe
I'll get some new ideas. Alright, I have a bunch of stuff. Starts out alphabetical, anonymous
audio, it's a show with tech news and they're really good at explaining things. So I don't
know, it was a Firefox plugin that was allowing you to take over people's Facebook sessions
by stealing their cookies and this that and the other and they explain really in depth
how that works and how you don't have to have this plugin to do it. You can just do it
on your own and how to block it and this that and the others kind of neat and they really
go into depth about tech news. The next show is Common Sense with Dan Carlin. Now I'm
going to have a list of these on the HPR site but feel free to write them down. I would
write them down. If you've listened to my my ADHD episode, you don't understand why, but
Common Sense with Dan Carlin, it's a political show by a guy that's not really affiliated
with the party and he doesn't really offer solutions to problems without offering like
awesome solutions that I really enjoy or but he has really interesting ideas and he does
another show we're going to talk about in a second that I liked a lot more than I liked
this one but it takes me about a common sense or two common sense episodes to cut my
grass so like every two weeks I get out to push more except in the winter and I listen
to some common sense while I cut my grass and it just like gets me thinking about stuff
that I don't like think about normal times and gets me all pumped up and then my grass
is done and I'm all excited. Alright the next show is a Coverville. Man it's really
into tech here. Good thing I'm this hacker public radio. But Coverville is cover music done
by this guy named Brian Ibit and it's really hit or miss and it's mostly miss to me. So
like he'll play a themed episode or it was being like a random hodgepodge of stuff and
he uses the word hodgepodge and you get bonus points for that and most of it's really
really bad and then they'll be like this awesome cover or a whole show that's just awesome
here like that. It's worth skimming through every once in a while. Alright the next one
is Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Show and this guy is not professional historian which
is bonus and he talks about history stuff that may or may not be correct but it's definitely
interesting. I highly recommend everyone listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History because
you really need eight hours of punic war coverage in this day and age to really over audio
because that's awesome. The next one is Euro Trash Security. Hold on I have crying kids
I'll be right back and I'm back and y'all didn't even miss me. So anyway Euro Trash it
is a new show they emailed me about it and they were like hey put this on hpr but it's information
security news and interviews by some Europeans. It's pretty good. The next one is Flatland
which is a romance of many dimensions. Most of you will be familiar with this book if you're
not you should definitely become familiar with this book. I think it was written like the
1800s and it's a math book with a story which is fucking weird and maybe you've heard
the band called they might be giants and they sing a song about ideas from Flatland like
why triangle man always wins because he's he's pointy and like in a two dimensional world
where everyone was a shape triangles are really pointy and they're the soldiers because they
can stab you and women have to whistle because women are all straight lines and two
dimensionally if you look at a straight line long ways it's this long long line but if you
look at it head on it's really super pointy it's this little dot it's hard to see it and they have
to whistle so that you know they're coming they have special doors to go in their houses it's
weird but it's it's a podcast it's the audiobook version of Flatland and it's totally awesome the
next one is Freakonomics Radio Steven Levitt and Steven Somebody to one's economist and the other
one I don't know newspaper reporter wrote a book about freaky economic stuff and it was on the
New York Times bestseller list maybe you've heard of Freakonomics or super Freakonomics there's a
new movie they release some iTunes before they release it anywhere else and they have a podcast
and it's it's really fucking cool let's see yeah next is Hack Radio Live which is some HPR
contributors they have conversations where they discuss techy things HPR of course Hack or Public
Radio I listen to that sometimes then we have HBR which is Harvard Business Reviews idea cast
and they talk about businessy things I don't know I it's a business student I'm that kind of
nerd then we have NPR a lot of NPR stuff talk of the nation where they have uh interesting bits
that come out every day and they're like this is a five-minute segment from this or this is a
30-minute segment for this that's the talk of the nation and it's pretty good another NPR show
from scratch where they interview founders of companies and no it's kind of I think it's actually
a series not a show then there's NPR's Planet Money which is a spinoff of this American life
dealing with economics because again economics is super exciting and I don't know if you're this
American life listener you probably heard of Planet Money but you should it's actually something
interesting to listen to dealing with really boring topics and they're following Pietro revolt
these I can't pronounce things her book which is about cotton production tea travels of a t-shirt
I think is her name name of the book and they're making a t-shirt literally like their sourcing cotton
having it buy it from the farm taken into the factory to make cloth and yarn or whatever you may
got a cotton and then to a t-shirt company to make the t-shirt and to a printer to print it
and they bought a uh rap they bought a oh the real estate thing the people were buying
it was the lost all their value it's just on tip my tongue it's a weird little word combination
anyway a toxic asset there we go they want a toxic asset name Toxie and they they followed
how Toxie died and they interviewed people that were involved and like the houses the Toxie owned
and it was kind of cool um let's see fresh air another NPR show they do interviews apparently
I'm a business and NPR nerd another NPR show wait wait don't tell me which is a weekly news quiz
which is awesome it's it's very funny uh the cotton club which is tech news they took out like
online branding and marketing social media and it's done by some people in Arkansas which when I
think you know social media I immediately think Arkansas but they're they're pretty good um
the drill down is a show that's on my iPod I've listened to like two of them they interviewed the
Reddit guys and I was like I'm gonna listen to this it's lots of people you know hosting the show
collaborating working on it and it's tech news they discuss um the moth which is a live story show
without notes and they tell stories that are somewhat interesting have a little contest and
this that the other um this American life very interesting show where it's somewhat weekly but
there's a new and every week sometimes it's from the archive and they tell stories of this American life
and most of these are really good the next one is a show called What Endures and it's put on by
I don't know some department at Louisiana State University and they talk about Louisiana history
like the flood of 1927 and they talk about T. Harry Williams who's the the autobiographer
Hughie Long who was awesome and he wrote all these 800 page books in long hand in his wife typed him
all up and I think that's funny wish my wife would type stuff for me no I don't she's got better
stuff to do um radio lab is the last show on the iPod it's kind of a weird or a weirder version of
this American life where they kind of do interviews and write stories about the weird topic
I don't know so not really a lot of tech news now that I'm looking back at this
got some history some business
not economics weak um but yeah that's the stuff I listened to and I don't listen to all of it
there's I don't know hundreds of episodes of my my iPod that I have not
rocked out to you but I will one day maybe maybe not anyway I've been droops and this is an HBR
