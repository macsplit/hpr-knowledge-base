This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3556 from Monday the 21st of March 2022.
Today's show is entitled, TTS for HPR.
It is hosted by TakeUp751 and is about four minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is,
a few voice samples to swap a speak TTS and HPR in TRO.
Hello everyone,
Talk of 751 speaking.
In today's show,
I would like to
propose
a replacement for the airspeak TTS
in the show.
To make it so, I will try to use a platform called OpenTTS,
which is a Dockerized web service with multiple TTS backends
and it is compatible with the Maria TTS API calls,
which makes it perfect for integrating into, for example, Microsoft or any other service
which needs the TTS.
With no further ado, I will start playing them with the introduction and then with the
HPR episode similar as the introduction that the eSpeak does now.
And then it's probably easier to choose from these options and you might find something
that's more appealing to the community.
I use the default settings and I will include the name of the voices in the show notes as well.
These are far from perfect but very less robotic than airspeak.
Please share your opinion about these voices in the matrix chat or in the comments section.
Let's start them now.
I am co-keyed with old speech.
