This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3802 for Tuesday the 28th of February 2023.
Today's show is entitled, Attack of the Squish Mellow.
It is hosted by Rowan, and is about 97 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is Rowan Records replacing the screen to a MacBook Pro.
Hi, welcome to Hacker Public Radio, this is Rowan.
And today I will be replacing a MacBook Pro laptop display.
We had a tragic Squish Mellow accident over the holidays.
Yes, be careful, even the Squish Mellow can destroy your electronic screens.
It hit the laptop while it was open, slamming the lid shut onto the keyboard,
and we ended up with no screen except for a nice crack that is backlit whenever the laptop is on.
So, not a happy incident, but we do get an XPR at the start out of it.
We initially were thinking we were just going to end up replacing it at the laptops.
I think circa 2017, a lot of times when you look at the cost just to buy a replacement screen for a MacBook,
it is particularly if you are not buying something a brand new laptop,
if you are going to try to replace it for the same advantage,
it costs more to replace the screen just to buy the screen,
not even if you are going to have somebody replace it for you.
So, initially we were thinking we are going to have, we looked around,
and the initial prices we did find were like, it was the same deal.
It was like, well, let's say we can find a similar MacBook to buy,
but then my wonderful girlfriend kept looking and she found a screen for $200,
which is not inexpensive, but looking at the $450 to $500 US dollars,
we were seeing everywhere else, this is quite the deal,
and I had successfully replaced an iPod touchscreen before,
and I've messed with my other Dell and HP laptops,
so I've done some repairs on laptops before,
so I feel confident enough that it's worth buying the screen and giving it a world.
So, here we are, and we found, actually my girlfriend did all the research on this,
before she said, can you do this? That was great.
She found an iFixit article on it,
and that's what I'm going to be using today to walk me through.
It says it takes one to two hours, I'm probably figuring three to four to do it.
I've already been at it, just the setup took me about an hour,
because of course I was trying to get everything set up neatly,
and then I realized that one of the first things that says is make sure
that the laptop is drained to less than, the battery is less than 25% for safety,
and you also need to turn off auto boot,
well, I couldn't see the screen, so I was like, okay,
we need to hook this up to an external monitor,
and I do have an external monitor,
but we did not have a Thunderbolt port to HDMI,
or DisplayPort to HDMI adapter,
so that was a quick trip to MicroCenter,
one of the big box electronic stores in the area to get an adapter.
That did work, it was a bit of fun,
because it, between having to actually put a charger on the MacBook,
and then hook up to the display,
I used the two Thunderbolt ports,
and so I didn't have a keyboard,
except for the keyboard on the laptop.
Well, like Mac does nicely,
if you plug in the external display, find it,
but of course nothing shows up on that screen,
I did figure out that if I turned it on with the lid down,
it then would use the external display as the main screen,
but then as soon as I opened the laptop lid up,
then it would want to switch back.
I finally, with a little playing around,
and not quite opening the lid up all the way,
got it to the point where I could check the battery level,
and that was already down to 12%,
so that was good,
and I was able to follow the instructions
for turning auto-reboot off,
so we're now at a point
of actually doing the physical replacement of the screen.
So let's go to iFixit,
and see what our next step is.
So let's see what I've done in that part,
so step two, the lower case.
Let's see, before proceeding,
I'm plugging power down your MacBook.
I have done that,
close the display and lay it on a soft surface,
topside down.
I guess the soft surface includes our
dining room table,
and preparation of this,
I mean, we already have a tablecloth down,
it's actually a plastic one,
so that provides a little cushion,
and I did actually lay some,
I took out a big wide sheet of Christmas paper
and flipped it over,
which does two things,
provides a nice white background,
actually a white background with grids on it,
so I will be able to easily see things
and take pictures for this episode's
page on HBR,
but also my idea is,
I want to be able to write
on the wrapping paper
of the various steps,
and then put the screws next to that step
so that I can make sure not to lose them,
and then also a wonderful idea
by my girlfriend was,
she has some of these little
plastic cups with lids
that I'm going to be able to tape down
to the paper,
and then put the screws in,
that way we have cats,
who of course get curious
whenever I start to do something,
so I won't have to worry about them
getting on the table
and knocking things around
or what I'm not looking.
So that is the setup,
there will probably be a picture
in the show notes.
So right now,
the next step is to use a P5
Pinto Loeb driver to remove
the six screws,
carrying the two lower screws,
two 6.2-millimeter screws,
two 5.3-millimeter,
two 3.4.
Throughout this repair,
keep track of each screw
and make sure it goes back
exactly where it came from.
Alright, so let me set up the table.
Actually, I need to go get a,
what do I need?
I need a pen.
Let's see.
So,
we're on step two.
Step two.
Interesting.
Now let's see how we need to do this.
I guess I can just,
here's a cup for each
of the two different.
It's going to be a little,
hopefully I have lots of cups.
So, I'm going to use the tape
to do the old,
put it in a loop
so you can sort of turn it into
double-sided tape.
Stick that down.
Let's see.
Probably going to be making a bunch of
editing for myself
since I'm just letting the recording go
as I do this.
I don't want to bore you all.
I'm actually taking
and taping three cups
to the Christmas paper
on the table.
And
I've marked step two,
and now I'm going to mark
the size of the screws
under a cup,
so I know which ones go where.
3.2,
3.3,
and 3.4 millimeters.
All right.
So, let's see.
I have to move.
I am getting more value.
I bought one of these.
I fix it.
I don't know how many pieces.
Like 50, maybe.
Some heads for a screwdriver,
so it has the driver part
and then the head
you can swap in and out.
And that's a whole bunch of them.
Which has come in handy over the years.
I would say if you...
Well, if you're listening to it,
you may be the person
that wants to receive this gift,
but it's definitely worth having.
It's definitely one of the things
that if I ever did
a what's in my bag episode,
it definitely is in my bag.
It's always I carry it everywhere
and pretty much all P5 star.
Let's see how this goes.
Let's see 6.2 millimeters
as the upper left...
Well, as I'm facing it,
the upper left corner.
And that works very nicely.
Here's one.
There's two of them.
I'll put them in the cup.
I'm going to put a little bit of tape
to be safe.
Let's see, we'll do the 5.3
which are in the other bottom corners.
There's one.
There is two...
The cup...
Alright, and now the 3.4
and two...
Okay.
For those curious,
this is their called
portion cups with lids.
3.5 ounce.
Let's see.
It doesn't have a
continuous
four-milliliter for our European listeners.
Maybe if I think about it,
I'll put it in the show notes.
Let's see.
Okay.
So now we're on to...
Throughout this repair,
keep track of screws.
Okay.
Step 3.
Apply suction cup handle to lower case
and let me see.
I know I have a suction cup.
I just have to remember...
Alright, let me pause this
and go get my other tool bag.
I wasn't quite as prepared
as I thought it was.
Okay.
So step 3. Apply suction handle to lower case
near the front center.
Area of the MacBook Pro.
Lift the suction cup handle to clear
the slight separation between
the lower cap chassis.
Okay.
Step 4. Insert
one corner of an
opening pick into the space
between the lower chassis,
the lower case and the chassis.
Okay.
Let's say try that again.
Now I want to get a pick.
Luckily I have acquired
actually from the
iPod Nano.
I have a little kit that came with it
and had a number of picks.
There's a pick in there.
Slide the opening pick
around the nearest corner and halfway
at the side. This releases
the first of the hidden clips
securing the lower case.
You should feel and hear the clip
pop-free.
And I'm feeling pressure.
What do you, which way is it going?
I don't understand.
No. So far I haven't
followed the pop-sword clicks.
What? There's around
the corner.
And I feel it getting tighter
if this releases the first clip.
Not there it is.
It does sound or feel good,
but I think it
popped it, I think.
Maybe. Yes.
Okay.
I need the previous on the opposite side.
I think. Okay.
Let's see what happens.
This is always the same part.
Time everything wants to slide
around a good bit.
There we go.
Okay. Okay.
Clip comes free.
Step six.
Insert your opening pick
once again under the front edge
and you're one of the two
centers. Give the pick a firm twist
to pop-free the third clip
to the lower chassis.
Okay.
Repeat this procedure
near the two centermost
group.
Front engineer.
Wow.
Gotcha. There we go.
Okay.
One of the centers popping the fourth clip
free.
The front of the mac book
away from the hinge area
to separate the last clips
can. It may help
pull first one corner
than the other. This clip may
require a lot of force.
Not something you want to read.
Uh.
Let's see.
I went one side.
Sort of stuck my
I was sort of holding
it on the one corner
on the back.
There's a little bit of a gap
there. Okay. That was actually that
bad. You can just put your hand
on the finger on the back
and push forward.
So I now have
the back off
and we have it open.
Let me
get a picture of this.
Got no here in it.
Let's see.
Okay.
So done this.
Step eight.
Remove the lower case. Okay.
Did that. Step nine. The battery connector.
Carefully peel up the large piece
of tape covering the battery connector
on the edge of the logic
board nearest battery.
Large piece of tape.
This is my Santa
I fix a kit and not that I'm
being paid anything for I fix it.
But I have to say they're
the stuff I bought from them
and
they're tutorials.
I mean in a lot of it is user
generated content.
But it's all been like
I would not be doing this
without this stuff.
It definitely makes it possible
to do it yourself. Let's see.
That looks
pretty similar to the laptop because
everything looks exactly the same as
it does in the
laptop.
That's not so bad.
Remove the tape.
Sorry, let me.
I don't know.
I just taped this
directly. I mean I'm just using
like
a visible tape that's not super
sticky. But I'll just flip that over
and tape this down directly.
And then mark it
on
just do it on the corner.
So it's not that.
Huh?
All right.
What was the step 9?
Step
on the battery connector.
Go on.
Okay.
Let's see. Step 10.
Gently peel back
the small piece of tape covering the
battery board data cable connector.
The tape is integrated into
the ribbon cable when not
detached completely. Simply peel it
back enough to access the connector.
Okay.
Gently peel that back.
Okay. I'll fall back
and take it. I see it's off the
connector. I guess it's just enough so
I see the connector.
Step 11.
Use the tip of the
spooger to flip
the small black locking tabs
carrying a cable on its connector.
To do it.
Okay. Flip this.
Oh, there we go.
Okay. Step 12.
Disconnect the battery.
Digit board data cable by sliding it out
from the socket. Slide parallel to
logic board in the direction
of the cable.
Okay. There we go.
Oh, that was so close.
Although now, okay.
Sort of the tape at the end to
gotten caught on my
pad. Let's now loose.
Let's see. Fold the
battery board cable back and out
of the way. If you're replacing
their battery, you may need to
completely remove the train. I hope I'm not
doing that. Okay. So I just need to get
it out of the way. He's a T5
torque driver to remove the three
points of the pancake screw
securing the battery power
connector.
Okay. There's that.
This is back. There's that.
Oh, okay.
Gotcha. All right.
So let me actually get this ready on
the right. Step 14.
Step 14.
I'm going to cut ready.
Another thing.
I bought a tape dispenser. I
guess it was two Christmas ago.
My girlfriend's like, why do you need a tape dispenser?
Until she tried using a tape dispenser.
They are very handy.
It makes it very easy to pull
a piece of tape with one hand.
You don't have to.
They're just handy. Plus it's helping
hold down the Christmas wrapping paper
column onto the table. All right.
So that's there. So now I need my
T5 torque.
And I'm just going to
allow the, okay. Now I pulled a
row in.
And I have put down my screwdriver
that I cut it up.
I just try to put down.
I did cover it up.
I got it.
The screwdriver has a plastic case
that comes in with all the different
heads on it. And then that slides into
the sort of fiber
case that holds it
and the bunch of the other tools that I bought
when I bought this kit. And I put that
over top of the screwdriver.
Let's see.
We need a T5.
You do T5.
To remove the 3.7
millimeter pancake screw
I'm scaring the battery power
connector.
There we go.
Okay. Right out.
In there.
Put the lid on it.
Need a little more space.
Keep covering things up.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Battery screw.
Okay.
Let's see.
Sub-15.
Here's a Spooger to gently lift
the battery power connector.
Disconnecting battery.
Lift the connector high enough so that
it stays separated from its socket.
If it actually makes contact
during the course of your good damage row.
Let's definitely not.
How do we lift this up?
Okay.
You just slide under
and somehow up there we go.
I see.
Okay.
All right. It comes up.
Is there a house?
The second that has two pictures.
I just want to show you.
It does go up pretty high.
The damage barrier.
All right. Now it's up.
Similar to how they have it in the
repair guide.
I'll take a picture.
And we can all
compare to the repair ride.
What I've done.
There we go.
Okay.
Let's see.
Step 16.
Remove the hinge cover.
Remove the four 1.9
millimetre T3 torch screws.
Securing the plastic covers on top of this play.
Remove both plastic hinges.
Okay.
Put it up up.
Let me get that set up.
What is this?
Step 16.
Step 16.
I just need one cup.
Put both.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's see.
I'm going to find my T3.
Two, two, two.
Two, three.
Come on.
All right.
Done.
One.
One.
Those are tiny.
I'm going to use those.
Two.
And this just popped up.
It was easy enough.
It's meant like a few.
So I get the hinge cover.
One with the screws.
And I'm working on the second one.
One screw.
Two screws.
And the hinge cover.
Another eight.
Step 16 is done.
Step 17.
Disconnect the main display cable.
Remove the two, two point nine millimetre T3 torch screws.
Securing the aluminum cover on top of the main display cable.
Remove the cover.
Let me see.
I don't know.
Do they turn this?
That's from, okay.
That's from the opposite end.
Like, it's the laptop.
It's sort of turned around.
And the picture to the way I currently have it in front of me.
Yes.
Judging by, okay.
So it's coming that direction.
Probably should just turn this around.
And make my life simpler.
So that everything is lined up.
And I'm trying to do a mirror image in my head.
Like, is there, so those are, there's two screws, I would say.
Yes.
All right, let me get the cup ready.
Remember, I thought I left myself in the plane.
But it's getting crowded in here.
Actually, with marking on the table, but that's okay.
I'll take some last 16.
Step 17.
Tea cup.
Tea cup.
Tea cup.
Tea cup.
Tea cup.
Yeah, that's sure cool.
Down the right.
I think that was a T3 that I had before.
Let's take these out.
Two of them.
That doesn't feel right.
Yeah, that says T3.
Let's see the comments.
I agree. If you try tightening these with T3, you'll partially strip them.
Use a T4. For me, the left one on the image
or T3 in the right is T4.
The one I have doesn't feel like a T3.
Let me try a T4.
That is a nice thing.
It's between the guides and the comments.
And, you know, I'm sure
there's a little, it may just depend on the, maybe the model.
There's slight difference or maybe just
what they had in stock when they were building these, I don't know.
But yes, that was definitely a T4.
All right, there's one.
There's two.
Yeah, that's definitely a T4 also.
Okay.
Two T4s, that was step 17.
Step 18.
Remove the two 1.7-millimeter T3s.
Torx screws.
The aluminum.
Securing the aluminum cover on top of the display cable flex connector.
Remove the cover.
Wait, does our remove the cover remove the cover?
On the last step.
Let me go back.
What does that have to do?
Just grab my tweezers.
Come with these really super pointed tweezers,
which are great except I lost the plastic sort of cone-shaped piece
that goes over them when you're not using.
So it's very easy to poke yourself with them.
Which I have done a number of times.
I keep trying to find something to use to replace it.
So far, I'll just keep those out safely to the side
because I think I have to do the same thing.
And step 18 is moving this other cover that was right below.
Let's see.
Remove the two 1.7-millimeter T3 Torx screws.
Securing the aluminum cover on the top of the display cable flex connector.
Remove the cover.
All right, step 18.
Step 18.
I'm going to cut.
Now for the screws.
They say T3.
I'm going to guess these might be T4s.
Yeah, they're T4s.
So I'm going to just one, two tweezers to get the cover off.
We just pop off.
Oh, there we go.
All right, I'm going to just hit the floor.
Okay.
Step 18 is in the cup.
I'll just poke myself with the tweezers.
Be very careful with them.
19.
Try the display board flex cable straight up from its socket to disconnect it from the display board.
Okay, where's my screwdriver?
Two.
There it is.
Oh, let's see.
Straight up.
Oh, oh, my God.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, there we go.
Okay, that worked.
That is disconnected.
Step 20.
Unscrew the display cable covers.
Move the four.
1.5 millimeter T3 torch screws carrying the two aluminum cup covers on top of the two display cables.
Here's a pair of tweezers to remove the two aluminum covers.
All right, we get that already on the table.
So this is step 20.
I think I can get away with one cup for all the same.
Okay.
I think I'm going to go with the T4 again just because that's been working with everything else.
It doesn't seem to.
Well, is that it?
These may actually be T3s.
It's hard to say.
Feel kind of.
Let me try the T3.
Yeah, yeah, that's a defy a T3.
And these are another really tiny screws.
There's one.
There's two.
The cover just sort of spun off a little bit.
I can probably just get that with my fingers.
Well, yep.
Into the cup.
Go for the second cover.
Screw one.
Screw two.
I feel like I should be if it wasn't so cold out doing it outside.
That's just sort of spinning.
I think that's the one common above.
The guy said the one was a T3 and the other was a T4.
That's happening here.
That's an handy.
Now, what do I do?
Maybe I'll just put a piece of tape on this one.
So I know that it's a T4.
I don't know if it's definitely a T4.
Do I do this?
It's not making any more difficult for myself.
I'm just going to put this on a piece of tape and sort of tape it on the inside of the cup.
So I know that's the T4.
All right.
So far, so good.
All right, step 21.
I'm screwing the antenna assembly.
Remove the two 30.3 millimeter T5 torque screws.
One from each side, securing the antenna cable assembly.
Also remove the 4.1 millimeter T5 torque screws.
One from each side.
Move the one 12, 1.1 millimeter p-pantolo screws.
Six from each side.
All right.
So I need one, two, like three cups.
Oh, okay.
I see that.
All right.
I need to do three cups out.
One, two, three.
Step 21.
Sorry to keep mumbling.
I need to remember I'm trying to record this and not mumble through my three cups.
So tape.
One, two, three.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Let's mark down what's with this.
So we're going to do a 3.3 millimeter, 4.1 millimeter, and 1.1 millimeter.
Just like 21.
Keep it clean.
Let's see.
I guess we'll just do this in the order as it says.
Oh, here comes a cat into my lap.
T5, T5.
All right.
I need you to go away.
Thank you, Kitty.
One from each side at the end.
And she's back.
This time behind me.
So that's okay.
Here's one screw.
Nope.
All right.
You can stay in my lap.
Really?
It's more of a one man job than a one man in a kid cat job.
Here's one.
Second screw.
Okay.
Now I need these are T5s also.
4.1 millimeter, one from each.
Okay.
Where are they?
I'm very confused.
Oh, wait.
Did I do that wrong?
Oh, crap.
Do we have two antennas?
Oops.
That's on Andy.
Let's see.
I was going to say, well, 3.3 and 4.1.
Can I see the difference?
Yes.
I think I can.
What did I say?
4.1.
Is the second one that looks bigger?
Yeah.
Okay.
So there's two antenna one on each side.
And so they have mirror screws in the same position.
Like the assemblies look the same.
They're just mirrored on the left and right side of the laptop.
So what am I taking?
Now before I go whole hog.
Oops.
Let's get the right screw.
There it is.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
So this should be the 3.3 millimeter from the other side.
Okay.
And this.
This.
Okay.
Wonderful.
All right.
It shouldn't matter.
Make sure I know what I'm doing when I put them back together.
Probably.
Yeah.
Okay.
4.1.
I'll just sort of flips up there.
Okay.
Now remove the 12.1.1 pantaloupe.
So that's 6 per side.
All right.
And that's a P2.
All right.
P2.
So on the, that's one of them.
And these are really small.
1.1 millimeter P2.
And I was doing the iPod touch.
I actually.
And I think it made more sense for that because one is much smaller,
even though it does have, I think, just about as many screws in it.
But I sort of laid all the screws out in the shape and position.
Or the approximate shape and position of how I pulled it,
like I unscrewed it from it.
I pretty much put the screws, like, right back into the same holes
that they came out of.
I'm going.
I'm going to see I'm not going to be such a big deal for this.
And I mean, not worry about it.
I don't think it will be an issue.
And now on screw seven, eight.
Coming out of the one that's on the left side is facing me currently.
There's sort of grouping them in the cup.
One side to the other side so that I'll know at least one side they came out of.
But like I said, it shouldn't really matter.
Sometimes I'm a little more particular about that than others.
I think it's more important.
I just make sure I get the right sizes.
And this cup, I like this cup situation.
All right.
All out.
Securing the rest of the antenna cable.
Okay.
So now on to step 22.
Did I?
Oh, boy.
Oh, good.
I'm recording.
I'm like, did I start recording again?
That would have been painful.
All right.
Step 22.
Carefully disconnect the two antenna co-ex cables by prying them straight up from the logic board.
Slide your tweezer or screwdriver to each cable until it's near the socket
and gently twist or pry up to disconnect.
Okay.
Do these two?
Okay.
I've done this before with other things.
This is always fun.
I mean, you'd actually get my glasses on for this.
Oh.
Speed is always...
How do you gently pry up the twist?
I'm not...
I wonder if I can just...
There, you know, I just took a pair of tweezers and sort of slid it between the cable and the...
on the back, the frame, or whatever it's on, and I just sort of popped it.
There we go.
Okay.
So those are up, pushing them back out of the way a little bit.
All right.
To reconnect, I'll worry about that while I'm dribbling.
Press down.
Okay.
Step 23.
Remove.
Oh, okay.
Remove the 2.8-millimeter T5 towards screw, securing the two antenna co-ex cables to the main board.
All right.
Look at that ring.
Step 28.
Open it on.
Step 23.
Push.
Thinking.
Step 23.
Okay.
The T5.
Okay.
All right.
That's done.
Step 24.
Unseat the antenna assembly.
Okay.
Okay.
The T5.
Okay.
All right.
That's done.
Step 24.
Unseat the antenna assembly.
Okay.
All right.
That's done.
Step 24.
Unseat the antenna assembly.
Using an opening pick to lever out the antenna K.
Do not slide the opening pick from side to side.
There are two display cables in the way that made damage.
Alrighty.
So I guess you just sort of find the different spots and lift.
All right.
Where are they?
Oh, okay.
That's really simple.
Not that's not like it's super stuck in there.
They do it in the opposite.
Do the other side.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not sure what I was supposed to lift.
The middle part is not.
There's a real place to.
If I miss the screw, I don't think I miss the screw.
I think I'm just not.
There we go.
I found the bottom part.
Okay.
Oh, I don't have that.
I want this first one.
Carefully remove the antenna assembly while simultaneously feeding the antenna cable bundle
through the hole in the chassis.
Okay.
Let's see.
Okay.
I still got to get this popped up.
Oh, there we go.
Two, two.
Try to work the antenna cables out under...
Oh, that's not like the...
Okay.
That is unhandy.
I'm going to try to keep...
So the ends were the attach.
There we go.
Okay.
Put this by step 23.
All right.
That is done.
Step 26.
Remove the antenna cable.
Antenna cable assembly.
I didn't know that I heard you do that.
Remove the antenna assembly.
Okay.
I did that.
Antenna cables.
Oh.
I already did that.
I'm very confused.
They look like the same thing.
Yes.
No.
I don't.
Maybe it's just two steps.
Let's just two steps.
All right.
I did both of those steps together.
Okay.
Unscrew the display cable assembly.
Okay.
Remove the...
Remove the four 3.9mm T3 Torch screws.
Scoring the cover springs on the two display cables.
All right.
Step 27.
Let me get that set up.
Oh.
Move this.
Okay.
Step 27.
Step 27.
Same screw.
So I can get what's on the cup.
T3.
How do I get?
T5.
All right.
T3 head.
T3.
How do I get?
T5.
All right.
T3 head.
Okay.
Let me see.
Yes.
That's...
I feel like...
T4s again.
Yeah.
That's definitely T4.
Oh.
Oh.
I apologize.
Oh.
Oh crap.
I guess I'll figure it out.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
I guess I'll figure it out.
I probably should have marked on my paper when I use different sized torquids.
Hopefully it will come back to me.
Oh yeah.
That works a lot better.
All right.
There's one.
There is two.
Two.
Come on.
There we go.
It's three.
That's horrible.
All right.
All right.
Grab the left side of the display cable assembly and pull it towards the bottom end of
the MacBook and away from the cover.
Excuse me.
Use a pair of tweezers to pull the cover spring on the display cable out of its recess.
Repeat the step with the right side cover spring.
I'm looking at it.
I don't know.
I see.
That should be fun.
Oh.
Let's see.
I always love spring assemblies.
They are usually so much fun.
That's weird.
Okay.
It's a little more delicate than I would think.
Oh, it's already out.
A pair comes here.
Am I just taking that out?
Do you just sort of pulled right out?
I didn't have to do it.
Maybe the other side.
Oh.
Okay.
Never mind.
I was just getting...
There's like a plastic assembly that I had already unscrewed.
Or that I guess I just unscrewed.
And you're just pulling it away.
There's like a ribbon attaching it to...
I guess the cover.
Okay.
So that's done.
All right.
Step 29.
Unscrew the hinge bolts.
Fully open the screen and stand your MacBook Pro up on one side.
While setting the MacBook Pro with your free hand,
remove the three T8 Torx screws from the lower display hinge.
Remove the remaining three T8 from the upper display.
All righty.
Let me get this set up.
Step 28.
I'm going to cut this.
Running out of wood.
Okay.
All right.
Let's turn this on its side.
Okay.
I guess I can grab another picture for potstarity.
I'm going to get the whole layout in this picture.
The hardest part is getting back into my phone.
There we go.
Let's turn this on.
First.
I'm going to sort of see it overlay of my setup.
Let's take these skirt on.
I'll hinge it out with one free hand.
Remove the three T8.
T8.
T8.
T8.
Yeah.
Let's have a look at that area.
Bottom first.
Oh, yeah.
These are going to be in there tight.
Okay.
So get out my little leverage.
Here we go.
There's one.
Oh, there's two.
Well, working on two.
As you would expect, the hand bolts are screws.
You think the tightest two.
There we go.
There's some of the three.
So the bottom is just about loose.
Almost.
There's three.
I started the top.
Number one.
I'm doing the middle first.
And then the bottom and the top.
I don't know if it matters.
Just felt.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
That was just the second to last screw to come out.
Oh, that's a handy.
On to the carpet.
There we go.
And the last screw.
Okay.
There we go.
Six are out.
It's very loose.
Now what does it say?
Remove the display assembly.
Keep a firm grip on both the screen and the main body of the MacBook Pro.
Either half can unexpected fall during the step.
Yeah.
Push both halves on the MacBook Pro together so that the hinge brackets can be lifted clear.
Can be lifted clear of their recesses and push the main body of the MacBook Pro away from you
while pulling the screen toward you to separate it.
Remove this display screen assembly being careful not to snag it on any cables.
Let me look at these three different pictures they had for the step.
Do I push?
Are they?
So are they?
It looks like they're not going to pop.
Okay.
Push both halves of the MacBook Pro together so that the hinge brackets can be lifted.
Oh, well.
That worked.
I just sort of moved it and pushed and it sort of popped apart.
Luckily nothing fell and I had my hands on everything.
So I now have the screen in one hand and on the motherboard and the other.
It's coming apart.
Alrighty.
That was step 30.
Step?
Oh.
Hmm.
Okay.
Well, I haven't actually opened up the box completely for the replacement.
I guess it comes.
This doesn't.
That's conclusion.
I feel like there's maybe that's all.
Okay.
Hold on.
Let me see what's going on.
Do, do, do, do.
Okay.
I'm back.
I just opened up, fully opened up.
Well, almost opened up fully the case, the box that the replacement display came in.
I just, I hadn't actually looked at the replacement screen yet.
So I finally started actually just taking it out.
And it does come with a repair kit.
So it comes with a little screwdriver with looks like all the different heads you need.
I already had.
But it's nice.
If you're buying it, you do get that.
And it looks like it comes with instructions on how to do things.
So that is nice too.
But like I said, I fix it's instruction.
Maybe they're probably print it right from my fix it.
I don't know.
Maybe not.
But.
Oh, okay.
So that's one of the reasons I guess Matt screams to get them that thin.
It's actually you get the whole assembly.
But it's the metal casing.
I don't know if it looks like it may even have the Apple logo on it.
I can't really tell.
And the whole display is similar like the, I guess the circuitry and stuff.
All right.
So now they're just short instructions.
And I need to take the tape and stuff off.
It's holding the protective, I have a piece of protective plastic.
And it also is holding the, like, circuitry spring stuff that was like in step 28.
No, not 28, 27 spring assembly.
Oh, so it doesn't move around during shipment.
I'm now trying to take all that off without scratching the screen.
Now that'll be pictures of everything in the show notes.
Okay, let's not drop my phone on to the next screen.
All right.
Let's get that out of the way.
Too would get this thing assembled.
So I'll take the old screen and get it out of the way.
And the box.
Let's see.
So I think basically now I just go through the steps and reverse.
Let's see.
Yep.
During assembly, ensure that the display cable simply lies on the correct side on the main body before refastening the hinges.
Be sure to confirm that both connectors on either side of the display cable assembly are fully seated as these may have come loose during the assembly process.
Okay.
I need that Mac plastic on until I have everything put back together.
Okay.
Make sure there you go.
Out of way.
Out of way.
All right.
This may take some thinking.
It was flipped over.
That slides in.
So that would go like that.
Is that where that stuff is?
Yes.
There we go.
Right.
That connector.
Okay.
Wait.
This is always the fun part.
Trying to get everything aligned to pack up to get it back together.
Yeah.
How do you think that?
Okay.
I guess I need to speed it back up to do this.
Try to remember how I had it.
I think it was like that.
Okay.
Yes.
That's folded out.
Now that doesn't work.
If I'm a clue, they must have been flipped over.
Out of way.
I don't.
All right.
Black screen.
Screen does not display the camera.
Check whether the cable interface on the screen is loose or off.
Be sure to connect it.
Black screen.
The screen does not display on the computer.
Please shut down and disconnect all the research computer.
All right.
So it does look like the camera cable did a loose.
Yes.
How does it connect?
All right.
So now I think I'm trying to get the camera cable connected.
I can't.
I don't want to have to take everything apart if I mess with it.
All right.
All right.
This is going to make for some exciting.
Luckily, I guess if I just keep quiet, I can use the automatic noise cancellation.
Ken has taught me multiple times whenever I do one of the community news.
Okay.
That seems to be on there now.
It was already on.
Okay.
So the camera.
It says make sure that you double check that the camera and the backlit display cables are connected.
And they both seem to be now.
All right.
How do I get?
How do I get this back together?
It looks because that looks like it's flipped backwards.
How do you?
Oh, just kind of grab it.
Okay.
That's what I thought.
But it was just difficult because it was a new spring.
So you have to grab the hand and sort of get it to come like it's in the open position,
which I, you know, was easy to do when it was actually connected to the laptop.
I just was very leery of applying any extra pressure, but as they did move after I...
Okay.
So now I can...
I can just stand these two up on the side, like I did before.
Except this was like...
How does that work?
I can make sure that's there, right?
Okay.
It's there.
It's there.
So that goes like that.
Okay.
That goes like this.
And this goes like this.
Okay.
That should slide in.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Why?
How do you get everything lined up?
Very layers.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
That should slide in.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Why?
Okay.
Why?
Trying to get everything lined up.
Very layers.
Okay.
There we go.
Now do I have no cables sticking out in any weird places?
No.
Okay.
So I should be able to try to get some screws back into my laptop and not quite lined up.
Oh, no.
There we go.
Sounded better.
Looks better.
No cables.
Hot or destroyed in that.
Okay.
All right.
What do you mean?
At least give one screw in here to give me some wiggle rail.
All right.
So step push.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Step 28.
29.
While studying the MacBook remove.
So let me do this in reverse.
I guess we'll do the upper brackets first.
Now do this.
So let me.
These are torques.
I guess we sort of want to do it to it.
I guess I don't need to tighten it quite up.
Yeah.
So maybe I'll just do it hand tight for now.
I don't want to.
I mean, I know with the hinges, you definitely want them tight enough.
But I also don't want to.
I just lined up.
So.
All right.
Now.
There's two in the top.
Now for the bottom hinge.
Okay.
We are recording.
All right.
All right.
There we go.
Okay.
So I'm trying to.
Yeah.
Middle bottom.
Let's do two in the bottom hinge.
I definitely going to need to double check these.
Especially the bottom of that one.
It doesn't seem to want to go in all the way.
Which means I should try a different screw just.
I think that's like that.
That's not going in all the way.
You can get my finger tip.
You can get my finger nail under the edge of it.
And I'll try a different screw on.
See?
I mean, it shouldn't matter.
But.
I don't.
It's just going to be the case where you want.
Or is it just mean it's not incorrectly?
I don't know.
Probably going to.
Oh.
Okay.
Well.
I'm just going to put the other one in.
Go ahead.
Hold on.
Easily.
It's like this.
I'm going to lined up correctly or something.
Don't know why it's not.
Just.
It looks okay.
I think.
And it is off a little bit.
Why is I think?
I don't know.
Unless it just happened to be a slightly shorter screw.
In the rest.
See if I can.
Just.
All right.
I need a little more weight on the subject.
Uh.
At the mark.
Where's my.
Let me get it.
Okay.
Let's calm down.
Tensions are running high.
Let's see.
I don't.
Yeah.
It's going.
Let's see.
So.
All right.
It is just tightening in more.
I just needed to.
The screw driver that comes.
It has a little like leverage device.
You can stick out.
You need to stick in it to give you more leverage.
Um.
So I used that.
The tighten up that screw that wasn't going in.
And it went in all the way.
And I'm just going to go back and tighten up the other ones a bit.
Um.
Just to make sure I did have to use the leverage thing to get them loosened up.
And.
Of all the screws on here.
I'm usually very highly go.
I'm not one to over tighten things.
Um, but given that it's a hinge.
I know you don't want it coming loose either.
Just going through and tightening each of these up.
Technically, I guess with a torque, it should pop if it's going to strip anything.
It shouldn't tighten more than it's opposed to.
All right.
That's.
And I get the area over tightening the things.
I'm a little bit more.
And then I'm.
I mean, worst case scenario, like I think I just need to tighten those screws.
I just need to.
I don't think there's.
I just need to take the back cover off, which would be ideal, but it wouldn't be horrible either.
Okay.
And I should be able to close the lid and then reverse the rest of these steps.
I closed these enough.
It seems.
I don't see anything getting.
Looks pretty good.
And I have a closed looks like the regular gap or non-gap with the back over.
All right.
So we did 29.
And then 20, okay, 28.
So now we do us put back the display assembly cable.
So that's this little spring thing that goes back in here and gets screwed in.
I'll just that.
Oh, let me look at this.
Back.
So that should just burn the screw.
That goes there.
So that would go in.
I don't know.
There we go.
Yes.
Where's that go?
Very confused.
No.
Second flipped over.
Got it?
Yeah.
Okay.
That looks great.
28.
No.
Well, where did it go?
All right.
I'm just confused.
No.
That's because 28 is.
Well, that was 29 technically.
I think when I did this.
Andrews.
I've mislabeled.
Okay.
And basically, I think when I did this.
Andrews.
I've mislabeled.
Okay.
And basically, plans.
Even this is now confusing me.
I think these are just reassembling.
It means getting things back in place.
Without the screws.
I mean, like just getting them lined up so you can screw stuff back in.
Okay.
So I'm going to try both sides.
Like that?
Should we hide back out of that?
No.
That would be the other direction.
Like that.
There we go.
Okay.
And use the screws in this way.
Okay.
Unscrewed.
That's 27.
Okay.
All right.
Now we're back on course.
It's a little bit confusing, but I think we're back on course.
That doesn't seem to be going back in quite.
Right.
That's what we'll say.
All right.
What do we need?
We need T3.
T3.
T3.
T2.
T4.
Oh.
Oh.
This is T4.
There we go.
Now we're going to lay it.
Let me see which one says T3, but maybe it's a T4.
I think it was a T4.
Yes.
No.
I think it's actually a T3.
Everything there is a T4.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
There's one.
Well, I'll do a partially, and I'll get the other screw started.
Okay.
Yes.
Now, is it going in?
Seems to be.
Yep.
Tighten it up.
Here's one.
Tighten the other side.
Oh.
Beautiful.
All right.
Just start to simply back in there.
Keeps going out.
Big screw.
All right.
Well, knock on wood.
I probably shouldn't say anything yet, but...
So far this has not been quite as bad as I thought it was going to be.
Particularly given the number of instructions, but I may be jinxing myself.
I guess we won't down until we actually turn it on and see a screen.
Just put that partly in, and then get the other screw and keep wanting to pull away from
like lining up.
There we go.
All right.
I had to use my spoon to hold it in place when I got the screw started, but now it's
going.
I'll take all this stuff.
Okay.
That's in.
Yep.
That definitely is torquing out.
If I didn't just strip it.
Hopefully I never have to find out.
Okay.
I'll call that good.
All right.
26.
I'm moving the antenna cable with some, well, reinst.
Wow.
Is there something?
I'm a double check.
I feel like I'm missing 27.
Did I pop?
When did that pop?
All right.
During assembly, gently pinch the cable bundle together and guide through the hole and
the chassis until the correct position of the board.
If you need to use your tools, I'll guide it through.
Okay.
26.
That's...
I don't know.
I feel like...
No, that's definitely...
Okay.
That definitely goes in there.
This work.
Oh boy.
There we go.
Oh, there we go.
All right.
That's not so bad.
It's actually easier to get it back in there than to get it out.
Okay.
Gently pinch the cable bundle together and guide through the holes.
If you need to.
Okay.
That's back there.
25.
Carefully remove the antenna.
Subway well.
Submit the antenna.
Okay.
I did that.
Unseek the antenna.
And now I need to recede the antenna assembly.
And exactly know how that works.
I'll just press down on it.
I don't know.
I'm kind of pressing down on it, but I don't think...
Oh, there we go.
I just sort of heard something click.
Finding where it is to get it to click is one thing.
The left side and the middle definitely seem better seated than the right side.
I just...
It doesn't matter once I get the screws on.
All right.
Let me consider that done.
I took my clipped in the middle.
All right.
I'm going to assume that's good.
Remove the two-way towards screws securing the two antenna cable.
Feel like something's not.
All right.
What is that step?
I don't know.
I just set 23 and that's the right cup.
And then I order.
T5.
What do I have currently?
I'm going to lay down on my flashlight.
T4.
T5 tip.
Yeah.
I mean, we made here a dog barking in the background.
He's outside.
He's a little noisy at times.
That was what generated that last side.
If you didn't hear it.
Yeah.
I think somebody was walking around.
A dog may have been one of our neighbors.
His dog name is Tula, who they will come in.
Now he's inside.
Okay.
I need to reconnect the antenna.
I only feel like I'm missing it.
These are always fun.
These little antenna.
They have to sort of line them straight up and press down.
Okay.
Okay.
Boy.
These are hard to line up.
They sort of look like they're lined up.
You would think that cables kind of bent back in the right shape direction.
I might be the idiot line.
A pair of glasses for this.
Let's try this again.
I knew this was going to be a pain.
These are always a pain.
It's like you can.
Come on.
It's like trying to get the line up and at the right angle and everything.
It's very difficult.
We've got to practically go straight down on.
I don't know.
No meter.
Target.
Half a millimeter.
Target.
You're trying to.
This is probably going to be the best difficult part of the whole process.
I wonder if getting the other antenna on first will help.
If that goes on any easier.
Of course it did.
Nope.
I didn't just pull it myself.
These glasses aren't particularly out there.
I don't know where it is.
I don't know where it is.
Like workbench.
It's got magnifying glasses that you can set at different angles.
To help work on small, tight pieces like this.
That's what I thought it looked like.
It's just no way to see.
Like when you're lined up and that kind of...
Amazing.
Okay.
It seems on.
The worst thing would be to...
Of course these days you don't have your antenna.
You don't have internet.
And you'd tell me how much of your...
...and the modern world, particularly when it's for a tween girl's life is...
I mean...
There we go.
Not connected to the internet to some way.
We would not be able to play Roblox.
And that would defeat the purpose of having a computer.
Okay.
Wow.
There's a back-on.
Nice.
Okay.
Now...
Okay, so now we're back.
We're back to the screens.
Alright.
We'll do the P2, the 12 of them first on screwdriver.
P2.
Tiny, tiny screws.
Wow.
Those are tiny, tiny screws.
Oh boy.
Alright.
Okay.
Let's look.
There we go.
There's one.
There's two.
Come on.
There's three.
I am putting it back together.
Yep.
I don't know.
I am pressing myself sometimes.
Yes, this has actually been relatively painless.
I probably keep saying something too soon, but...
I gotta go back this direction.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I still get a little ways, but I mean...
This is actually the hardest part is getting this assembly back together.
And then everything else should be relatively...
Seven.
One side done.
I'm doing on the other side of the internet.
I'm looking for this small screws.
Ah, screw two.
I'm just, I guess, screw nine altogether.
Oh.
Oh.
That is unhandy.
Alright.
Well, apparently one of the very small screws stuck to my extra screws stuck to my finger
as I was pulling one out.
And I just fell one down my leg.
Or hit the floor.
Oh, that could be fun to fun.
Get this other screw in first, and then I will look on the floor.
And of course, now I have a cat coming to get one.
Fine.
Alright, Mr. Banks.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to put you out of my lap.
Because a black cat does not help when I'm looking for a very small black screw.
I'm used to the carpet.
I mean, the carpet is sort of blue and white, too.
And hopefully we would keep it from bouncing too far.
Of course, now I have a cat trying to come and be helpful and get love.
That's not very helpful.
Oh, boy.
Let's get the flashlight.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
You got to move.
I'm afraid you're like, you know, I need to be.
I would hope it wouldn't bounce that far.
Pretty short.
I found it.
Don't see it on the floor.
I hope that it shoots not it.
It's very unhandy.
Oh, did it.
Get caught in my cold day.
I'm going again.
That's not like on the ground.
Ah.
Mr. Holley.
Well, one screw left in the club.
And two screw holes.
I think it would not be that difficult, fine.
But apparently, I'm going to go.
Ah.
And that's a piece.
The only downside is, I was sitting in a, like a weaker bottom chair.
So I guess technically it could have disappeared.
It's not the best of shape.
We've gotten down in between.
That would be weird.
Then I'd hit the table.
And now I felt it, right?
Like fall off my finger.
I'm sitting down.
I'm going in my lap and straight down to the floor.
I understand how I'm coming.
Go on that.
Yes, you're very serious, Mr. Mings.
But you're not being very help.
All right.
I'm going to stop the recording for a minute until I can fall.
The screw.
Hmm.
Wow.
Okay.
I was able to find the screw, thankfully.
That is a really small screw.
But a little perseverance.
And the flashlight from my phone.
I was able to find it.
So now let's get back to putting these back in.
See if I can do this without dropping anymore.
Especially really tiny screws.
It's even fun just trying to get them lined up.
So I can get this screwdriver head into the screw.
Okay.
That's an helpful one.
Getting everything lined up is not the easiest.
There we go.
Just like one more.
Okay.
All right.
Everything is done nicely.
Now we need to summit T5, the 4.1 millimeter.
And that is the orange.
That's the solution.
Okay.
Get the other one.
To do it.
Okay.
Now we need the 3.3.
T5.
That goes.
That's what I think.
There we go.
Why?
There's some cables here that just are here.
Like where?
Does that cable and get put back in?
Yeah.
Something feels like I should be connecting some of this cable.
Like I messed something.
I don't think I used to.
I did that.
I did that.
20 or this.
Disconnected.
And I got that.
Put all the screws back in.
Put it up slightly.
That's still connected.
Which is like a disconnect.
Just feel like there's some parts that have...
Like that needs to get connected.
I guess I can do it now.
I guess maybe that's part of the cable.
So it looks like I need to be done anyway.
That's already on on the other side.
Does that have to work?
Do that?
Does that have to camera assembly thing that popped off again?
There it is.
I didn't have it all that way.
I can get this lined up all along.
I don't know what to do.
I don't have to push back.
The other side.
I don't have to put that.
Another one there is where he's sort of going to get it to go straight down.
Okay.
Yes.
Little connectors are a bit frustrating at times.
I think that was the camera one that I thought I'd connected.
I apparently hadn't connected very well.
I'm trying to get it.
Yes.
I don't know.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
All right.
I guess I really should make sure that was in there better before I put all this back together.
All right.
I think it's in there.
It just doesn't want to stay very well.
I guess I need to get that screw on there.
I guess this is the next one.
Wait.
Was that what happened?
Oh.
Nice.
Oh boy.
I screwed the screw in before.
Let's see.
Hopefully that will just bend back enough that I can unscrew it.
All right.
Never quite as easy putting these things back to get.
Okay.
I hope that's in there good enough.
All right.
That's connected.
I don't even know where I am at this point.
Oh.
Screw.
Screw.
Screw.
Okay.
Those are old.
21.
I'm back to 20.
Okay.
20.
Display cover.
All right.
Let's see this.
Push it over.
I think the assembly.
Where?
I like it.
I need to tell which side is up there.
Yeah.
Does it matter?
Is it kind of looks like that?
Okay.
I know this would be fun too.
I like that.
Yeah.
I think.
Okay.
On these also tiny screws.
T3, which I think ended up being T4s.
One of them was a T.
These were the actual T3s.
And the one was the T4.
Let me do the T4 first.
It looks like it's some point there.
There's like a sticky part or something on the one side.
So that's how I can tell which of these covers go on which side.
The T4 went in.
Let me get the T3.
The T3 screw.
Wait.
I really hope.
The T3 starts and everything is fixed.
I don't want to have to troubleshoot this.
I think I should do a two part.
I can do assembly and disassembly.
All right.
Vice versa.
I can't.
Okay.
There's one cable display cable cutter on.
That should also help keep that camera thing screwed tight.
Or the camera whichever connector that I was just having issues with down.
All right.
Make it.
Uh.
Pointing.
These screws lined up on the tip.
A bit of a chore.
Okay.
On the side.
Here's another of the tiny screws which is always fun.
All right.
Second side.
It needs to be in.
Okay.
All right.
2019.
Brian, this looks very straight.
Okay.
So now we're putting that's the one that kept confusing me.
But now I'm putting it back down.
One of the ones that kept.
There we go.
That one's actually fairly simple to get back.
Because it's bigger than that.
I think it's like as wise my fingertip.
All right.
All right.
Oh.
Now we're putting back.
What are we putting back?
There's covers.
The display flex cable cover connector.
Oh.
That is.
Step 18.
Here we come right out of the cup.
And a screw.
These T-3s, yes.
Except I think these under the T-4s weren't they?
This is one I should have been writing them down.
What they were different from what the instructions said.
Yeah.
I think that's a T-4.
All right.
Let's see.
All right.
Let's see.
All right.
Let's see.
All right.
Let's see.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All the word.
All right.
All right.
Let's turn.
Getting this cover back on is turning into a head.
Okay.
It's a bit taxing on the patients too.
I didn't think this one would be so difficult.
They're trying to get the two holes that the covers lined up.
And then actually keep the screw on the tip of the screwdriver.
And then through the cover and into the other reason.
I'm trying to put the screw through the hole in the cover first.
There we go.
Maybe that will make it easier to get everything lined up.
So now the magnetic tip.
The screwdriver head just pulled the screw right out.
Okay.
I'll try it the other way again.
Okay.
All right.
Except now the screw keeps moving.
He's our teeth.
All I do now is...
It's getting very close to you.
They're needing to do a lot of editing to keep this in SWF.
Free.
I think now let me try the T3.
I don't know.
I thought it was T4, but...
That doesn't seem to be helping me either.
There we go.
Got that hole started.
Let me get the other screw in there on the other side.
There we go.
Okay.
I don't want to...
Actually, I don't want to point where it's supposed to be.
Okay.
All of that.
Step 18.
We're going to be going next.
That's 17.
Yep.
All right.
Now we're putting the cover, I guess, on the main display cable.
So let's get another neat little aluminum pieces that go across the two screws.
That's another T3 it says.
That just got...
Oh boy.
All right.
My little aluminum piece just...
Where did it go?
I had to turn the computer over so it fell out of whatever.
That's what it fell into.
Not that there's a lot to go into, but it's found...
Looks like a space maybe around the battery.
Okay.
It's another one.
It's going to be a prickly...
Okay.
Got one side started.
And see if I can get the other side started.
You can do it.
There we go.
All right.
There's T3 in there.
Okay.
16.
These are the hinge covers.
Now I'm thinking maybe I should go back and apply those T8s again just to make sure...
Oh crap.
That's T3.
One thing you should always make sure when you put all your screw heads back in their little containers.
So you know you got the right size on...
Now that must be T4 because I got to T3 in there.
There we go.
Okay.
T8.
Just to make sure it feels...
It's going to go.
I'm just hand tightening it out using the leverage on it.
Maybe I'm not applying enough torque.
I don't know.
But...
All right.
So now let's put the hinge covers back on.
Maybe the hinge covers were the T4s.
Okay.
Starting with the right side and cover.
At least the right side facing me.
There's two.
The other hinge cover.
Okay.
I don't need to waste that up a little bit of the cover and other holes in quite...
There we go.
Shoot.
And I got...
Trying to get that screw back on to the...
I don't know how tiny these screws are until you're trying to put them back in.
Let's see.
There we go.
Okay.
Hinge covers on.
Tighten down.
Okay.
Where?
15.
Gently left a battery power connector.
Just here.
So now connecting that back.
And then I think that's when 14 is the screw.
Yep.
All right.
Ah, step 14.
T5.
Okay.
There we go.
Oh, wait.
It's not touch screen.
It's not touch screen.
It touched pad.
All right.
Fold the battery data cable back.
Now I'm going to run the opposite direction.
Where's this go?
And that goes back this way.
Yes?
Wait.
Something.
Doesn't that work?
Wait.
Where's...
Did I not do something for this one here?
That's because I had...
All right.
This is where I rotated it.
Use it to flip up the small black box.
Here.
Uh...
Is that right?
Right there.
Oh, okay.
Right.
All right.
Now I got to get the battery.
The actual connector back in there.
It's just...
Okay.
I got myself oriented.
So you slide the cable.
And there was a little tapy thing over the end that just sort of folded back.
Now I got to slide the actual connector.
I think that's still up here.
Yeah.
Into...
Hey.
Here.
I think one of these is your own insertion.
It's just all fun and dandy and easy.
We don't see you get them lined up in at the right angle.
It's everything else.
It's getting them to that point.
Do it for me.
Do it for me.
Do it for me.
I'm sure the cables are not all that good.
Flip them.
Flip them down.
Flip them.
Yep.
Okay.
Two of these.
Press.
Press.
The cover down.
Alright.
That was not...
Yep.
We're insert to ribbon.
Now we've got the battery.
That's the cover thing.
Yep.
One more.
Okay.
Two strips.
Okay.
Yep.
Okay.
That's back on.
That was step nine.
Oh.
That's the piece of tape covering the battery connector.
Alright.
Now we're actually to the point of putting the back on.
We're big.
I don't know.
I guess I'll do that.
Okay.
I'm sure this...
Alright.
Move.
Okay.
Oh.
This is that.
I've got to do it sort of in reverse.
I've just lit it on there.
I wonder if I have to sort of slide it on or split it off.
I've got to sort of slide it back on.
This is the part I don't like when they just say reverse the direction.
It's because I feel like there's like always this little bit of extra magic.
Oh.
I just felt something snap into place.
I've heard it.
On the one side.
Of course.
Now I've got to get it back.
Where's that click?
That's not the click I was...
Oh, did it?
Maybe it did.
Alright.
That's not...
I know.
Shoot.
Oh.
That's a little...
It's got this like...
I feel like that shouldn't be showing.
There's a little bit of black in this room.
Alright.
Now I get to pop this.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, that's just because this is the new...
That's the cover.
To cover these lines that sticking out.
I don't think that's supposed to be like that.
Alright.
Let me loosen those up.
What were the hinge covers for those T3s or T3s?
So it looks like the hinge cover, like when I got it positioned,
it's pushed back a little bit and it's sort of over the edge.
And so it's showing when I put the cover on.
And I don't think it's supposed to do that.
And I guess I can go back up and look at that.
Oh, really?
No.
I don't think it ain't.
So what screw size was that?
Hinge covers, hinge covers, hinge covers.
What do you think?
The edge is...
I can not find him to go.
I don't think I don't have any.
T3.
I have two of these.
Well, I wonder if it's because the new cover is slightly...
I don't get it.
Well, how did that come out of the way out?
It's tough.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe I just didn't tighten them down enough.
Try to tighten them down.
So close.
All right, let's see.
Oh, okay.
I'm excited because there's like these little grid things.
There we go.
So I just used my pick to keep the back...
that back-rate corner that wasn't going back for enough.
High enough so that I can push it back.
I think that looks better.
100% more.
It's a question.
Are these going to click in the place?
Oh, there we go.
Something just clicked.
All right.
Let these ask me, then.
I'll see where we are.
All right.
Now we are back to step.
I think it was two, which was taken out the screws.
All right.
Because I'm 0.4 millimeter.
These are all p-bottles.
Okay.
Is this one?
Oh, wait.
No, no.
Okay.
So there should be two of these.
These are the 3.4s, right?
Yep.
Oh, no.
No.
I thought I just dropped a screw on the floor down.
Luckily, these are silver, so they're a little easier to see.
But I didn't drop it.
And that's gone.
No.
That is the 3.4.
Yes.
Okay.
I'm going to get in now.
I was expecting.
And that is not that.
Because it's not pure-rate.
It's not quite lined up or something.
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't eat that.
It's not.
It's not right here.
I don't think this is quite lined up or something.
I just see though.
I think that's lined up.
I just don't feel like they're going flush.
That is definitely not.
I cannot believe they don't have a recessing flush.
That's definitely not a Mac thing.
Just like it's not clicking down in place.
Properly.
There's something.
There we go.
Okay.
I don't think it was lined up.
Not lining up.
There we go.
That feels better.
That still feels a little hot.
But maybe down.
I don't know.
All right. That feels better.
Once that still feels off.
I'm going to go for the other two.
These are the 5.3 and the lower corners.
As you can see, my patience is starting to fade after a couple of hours.
And it's getting to be dinner time.
So I might be getting a little hangry.
But it is almost together.
That's the other problem.
It's like almost together.
That one definitely went in correctly.
And we're going to have smoothly two more.
That definitely went in easier.
It feels right and looks good.
That was the corner I was having issues with earlier.
One more screw.
Oh boy.
Maybe just hit it a little.
There we go.
That one's good.
That one's good.
That one's still just a little bit.
I don't want to strip the screw.
All right.
Turn off the flashlight on my phone.
Flip this over.
Look it in.
Power.
Open the case.
Moment of truth.
I'm going to be able to hear the dwing.
Wait.
Oh.
Wait.
Oh, it's just very low.
Oh.
So the screen works.
It just said 15%.
I saw the little battery thing pop up with red.
And it said 15%.
So the screen works.
I don't know if it's going to start or not.
I figured since the power was,
and maybe it's not charging.
Is that power?
Is that not plugged in?
Is it charging?
Oh, let me do that again.
What's going on?
Do I have the right?
Oh.
Oh, there we go.
I hope you're that long.
And I see the apple.
We have success.
We have a fixed replace screen for microphone.
Oh, I know that may have not
have been the most exciting episode.
