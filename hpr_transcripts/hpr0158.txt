.
Okay, now you can go to this week when I can see the past, the luck, past, the kinds of stuff.
You can't wait for the water.
Okay.
Okay, now you can go.
Now you can stand for this week when I can see the room.
Oh, I'm doing fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
Fine.
Yeah.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
I can see the past.
Look past.
I can see the past.
Who wants to start?
First we're going to do two minutes of the thing.
We go through our room and we'll say who we'll be
whoever we are and when we're никогда last week Ann.
Every one a year.
We'll start, then, have a start rule, okay okay.
We're always on this week because we'll fight for all of your base that needs to be water off度 for today.
So that's, most of the life waiting another base back from that group of last year.
Then it will be a situation here, right?
Right away.
at work. I put on the new ESX I tested that out, so I'm going to sound as good as it was, so I'm going to get to that user for a while.
I'm going to do that later on. I'm going to do this and I'm going to have it in the next one.
How about you?
My name is Colin. I'm a new to be able to play other than Jamesford. I think it'll be an interesting time.
Uh, it's pretty good for me.
I hope I'm going to school, so I don't work at home.
Yeah, I want to school and I want to stay in this time.
Oh, yeah, go out of here.
Go out of here.
All right, I'm Will. I listened to you guys last week.
Really, honestly, not much of a lot of users. I understand and appreciate it.
I definitely want to get more into it.
But I've been mostly engaged with one of those users in the past.
I'm also an open-source software.
How about that?
Where do you find your own software?
I guess our software business is mainly running because it's a software company.
So if you are ready to go to the Linux, it's OK.
It's right in the system right now.
You might need to drop your own software.
You'll have to keep the system jokes down to a minimum today.
You'll have to pick on Fedora or something.
I'm looking to buy a house.
That's in my week.
That's pretty good market to buy a house.
Hopefully it's in a week I'll know for sure.
But we're going to put an offer in on Friday.
A million miles a week tomorrow.
Not a million miles from work.
We have to go to two decimal places in order to get accurate enough for it to even matter.
Just so you know.
Don't tell him.
How many miles from here it is?
Three, four, up our way to us.
See, that was a trick question.
If he doesn't come every week, he doesn't have an excuse.
You have to sell your house.
I don't know if that's out.
But that's pretty much benefit.
It's summer.
How are you guys?
Well, this was a filming week.
I was standing doing a lot of good news.
James swapped out the hard drive on this.
Awesome.
32.
This is that Dell 15.25, which is really I'm not that thrilled with honestly.
But it's okay.
It's light and handy to use.
The main thing I've been doing is I was messing around with Jack.
And I built the Jack tools.
And I'm disappointed in the else of performance.
It may be the sound card.
I can really get better performance out of OSS.
But you can't do as many things with it.
It may be that I have a seat.
You collect a lot of libraries to do it.
And also a QT.
And I don't have exactly all the versions match.
I mean, it's only the last numbers of the versions.
And maybe some of the lack of performance is due to that because I've done everything else.
I changed some things in the memory.
You know, it's basically better to run the audio stuff as root.
There's some problems with that.
So I changed some of the group memberships so that audio belongs and has root access to the kernel.
Without me having to be running is root.
And I also have the temp directory is a RAM file system.
So it's gotten to.
And when I also maxed up the buffer, but it's still not perfect.
I still get occasional little hesitations that I can be.
But it's way better than before.
Have you looked at this setting with the frames per period and the period per buffer?
I don't really have the two settings yet.
For your sound card.
Depending on the sound card, it kind of works on a lowing buffer system where you'll have this any chunks.
I think I have that option.
You increase it to more and you'll increase your latency.
Like you can see the latency doubles.
I want to get the latency down.
If you increase it then that decreases the number of glitch that will occur because of the kernel.
Usually and a lot of times too.
It's because of Matt having a real time kernel.
So that's right.
The kernel that you had really makes it different.
Sure.
It's a generic 710 Ubuntu.
I know Fedora has at the what's it called.
Carmen at home.
They have a real time kernel that they built specifically for the Fedora grading system.
Yeah.
It's a sub-studio.
It's just a bunch of studio.
Yeah.
But if you're looking at the snap of the snap of the snap of the snap.
You'll find it.
You'll find it.
You'll find it.
Oh, OK.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Then you can do that option.
So you might want to try it back.
I will.
Yeah.
There's also, I don't know much about that generic kernel yet.
But I know there's actually some commands you can give to the kernel space that will tell it not to do certain things.
And otherwise, you go ahead and do.
And that's supposed to also increase the likelihood of running into those dropouts.
What is the decrease?
I should.
I don't know.
Did I say anything?
I meant to.
Yeah.
It gets less.
You know, likely to have to.
Yeah.
Good.
One other thing too.
There's some settings that you can set on your PCI.
Sometimes it's in the BIOS.
What?
Yeah.
I think that's what his kernel would just see.
It's the latency of the cards.
And generally you want that set low enough so that it gets priority.
Pretty much what it does is it sets aside.
Okay.
32 ticks.
This card has access if it wants it.
And generally depending on the video card too, video cards will set the bump.
There's up to 64 or even 128.
And what that can do is it can start off the other cards.
Sure.
Because everyone wants to see what you want.
Perfect video.
But if you want the sound, then you actually have to go in and bump the video back down.
And maybe bump the sound card up to 64.
So the sound card gets that throughput.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's up to look at.
And other than that, we're fixing a simple leak.
But you know, when you plump, you better be able to take the day off.
So we put a wrench on it and instead we broke the pipe in the wall.
You know, water was off, but it took a little, like it's a water back on.
Yeah.
So I might have gotten more done with what we're going to.
But I'm going to deal with that.
Did you actually know when it bursted?
My wife just like to loop into the sap mold.
Just to drop off a bag of garrison when we get home in the car.
We just reached to the door and sat down to her noise.
And here's the pipe that broke and then they started letting me in.
Was it an GSF or was it an Marine?
Was it?
Was it a resolved time.
Was it?
MORROW, did you work out?
You unwind my hand.
I lied to you earlier.
It was.
What a problem.
Of course, we were just messing up.
Yeah, something on the lawn in the light was.
I was trying to fit it in.
So this is an I would put a wall in the pipe to buy.
Now come to this place, have this ever been that twice, maybe not anymore, but let us finally
try to listen to us and re-change the directional plan of course every window.
So time below is freezing, and if it stays frozen to May days, it will pass when it pulls
up.
Of course your property is probably lost, there are probably braids, and then with melts, then
melts.
Yes, exactly.
And last time I was actually a summonator, we closed, he had met with somebody privately
here.
People had locked in.
But the good thing is the basement here is so loose, this is a pH 208.
I don't know what that means.
I did some stuff.
I finally got my myth TV box set up with the high death card.
It works great.
I'll know that the cable system here broadcasts all the local stations unencrypted.
So the high death card works with the standard cable.
Was it a hotspot?
No, it was one of those HDTV, the ones that were specifically forliners.
There's actually a penguin on the card, so that's really why I bought it.
You can just plug it into the cable system, and I think there's like six or seven channels
that are...
Is it that many?
Maybe every six channels that are unencrypted.
PBS channels is for.
It's just like little TV programming they like.
So that's the next one.
Yeah, I'll get my talent, that would be...
Right.
But there's a normal box for my rabbit ears, the signal, because we live close to the open,
really weak.
There's a lot of times we get no signal.
And there's a cable that I've heard this before.
If you have a standard cable and you put this converter box in, there's like ESPN and some of the
HD.
And to some reason, cables, not cables are really starting it out.
So you're getting for your $20 cable, you get the $50 Schlaven.
Well, at some point I was able to get paid for use.
If it's not my actual or paid for use, I was able to watch it, but I can't read that anymore.
And they do for a while.
Yes, for a while.
A lot of them were 12 months ago.
And when the person didn't like the bar, and it's forward, faster, it was all.
So I didn't put another tablet.
They had like a bank, like a 10-digit.
I was getting a bit of a photo.
That's what I'm like.
Oh, yeah.
So I'm watching this.
And I'm watching along.
There's an interesting thing, too.
They send the standard definition channels through the digital signal.
So you don't get the high tap stations, but you get the digital.
You can add digital.
So they look significantly better.
The colors are a lot better than you'd get with the standard capture card.
And along with that, I also installed Mythdora 5.
I was on or.
It's got this.
Yeah.
Well, I was using Mythdora the whole way through.
I was using Mythdora 2.
I actually was using Mythdora 2, and I had all problems with it.
And Mythdora released a new version, so I got that.
And it actually worked really well.
I mean, the only thing that was kind of a hassle was setting up the digital stations,
because there's nothing that ties Charger's digital stations to the actual stations that it shows.
Right.
Their cable box translates everything from channel 84-0 to, you know, your channel 720.
So did you have to put them on the frequency table?
I didn't have to put the frequency table.
All I had to do was go in and autostamp for channels.
And then it got all the channels, and then I actually had to go in and assign.
Well, it actually has an option to skip encrypted channels.
So you scan and say skip any channels that are encrypted.
But these are even encrypted.
They actually show up live, but they probably say there's a signal there.
Yes, but they're just not displaying anything at this time.
I didn't see any of those.
So maybe they encrypt everything.
So that was kind of a hassle.
Because you had to watch the, you know, pretty much you turn out at 9 o'clock and go, what news is on?
Okay, well, that's what channel it is.
And then you have to go on schedules direct to look up the XML tag entry for that station.
Because every station is God.
You know, a little XML, like, six digit number that associates the channel with the guy there.
I guess right now you've done the work so you could share it on.
Yes, I could do that.
Now could you test this out?
Which is the ICT?
Or do you have the action installed on the system?
I don't know if they have a live CD or not.
Come on, the channel's all together.
Not very many, so you just get basic cable.
We have basic, basic cable.
So you scan, there's a lot of basic cables.
Right.
And yeah, we could get most of them over the air too.
The digital card also gets the analog.
Actually, well, I've got my old analog tuner in there as well.
So it can actually record two shows at once.
One on standard, one on high depth.
Actually, I got the mail.
Two weeks ago, I got the charger.
It's looked at the realign.
So in my August 19th, I know.
I know, but it doesn't help us.
Here's what I'm hoping.
Here's what I'm hoping.
That they're changing it on the front end and not on the back end.
So the channels say this name.
They're just sending it on some signal to update their set top tuners.
You know, I'm hoping very nice.
If they don't, I'll just go through and do it again.
I've already done it once.
So it'll only take half the month.
It's very proficient.
We had this system used on the laptop.
But yeah, those high depth stations look extremely good compared to the analog signal.
So what cable do you have?
BGA.
Just a BGA.
The bare bones PC that I got didn't have a DVI, otherwise I'd use that.
They don't want to go through HDMI.
Yeah, what is that?
DVI would have been good enough.
Right.
The signal that I'm getting over the cable system.
So I actually had to get a new PC.
It's an AMD 4600X2 giga RAM.
I got a 750 gig hard drive in there.
It's pretty much sitting at 100% CPU usage all the time doing train building.
Yeah, just for the IE part, right?
Oh, yeah.
And 1 hour of 4600X2 giga RAM.
That should do it.
It's going through and doing all the things coding.
Because without trans coding, an hour worth of video is about six and a half gig.
Within coding is 1.5 gig.
So significant space saver.
And you can't tell the quality difference once it's done.
So if you want to have ideas for trans coding.
It depends on how many hours you want.
I mean, I think about that.
I mean, we're recording to four stations a day or three or three or four programs a day.
So that's four or five hours.
We don't watch all of it.
We record it.
We record it.
Six.
Six.
That's pretty hefty.
Well, it missed the lead.
Mythdora has auto expired.
So as it wants to record new stuff, it'll hire things that are the oldest.
And then also has priorities so that if you watch this, it gives it a lower priority.
So it deletes before the stuff you have to watch.
So it's pretty smart about it.
One of the things I found out when playing around with that one is the DBI and HMI.
It's a very limited DBI.
It doesn't pass through all of you.
So it's the most region.
Well, it won't pass through all of you at all.
It's strictly a digital video.
Yep.
It's HMI will pass through all of you.
So I'm going to watch a video turn.
It's also going to work with HMI.
Oh, we're not.
A lot of other HCI cards from what's in it.
And after for the BDI books that I showed you is important.
Yeah, I'll be through it.
On the 2002's and kind of mostly.
On the NGD?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The NGD only has like one card that allows it.
Yeah.
It's like the DBI on the DBI.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So one thing I noticed too, the sound is a lot better quality.
You've been over the analog.
Significant.
Yeah.
Sure.
It's better.
No, it's better.
And you want to come over and watch it?
It's better.
The way I would come.
The offer wasn't for you.
Open.
He's family.
He's family.
You've come awesome.
Yeah.
I could bring the PC and show.
I could be the PC and plug it into that.
It wouldn't be that hard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's my two-hour thing.
Yeah.
That's my two-hour thing.
Yeah.
Okay.
I just worked and tried to get a TV set.
You can't lie.
It's hard.
It's hard.
It's hard.
Although I finally bought them.
Yeah.
I don't know if I wanted it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Maybe I will.
We'll see.
We'll see how it goes.
Okay.
Well, great, great.
Wonderful.
What do they do?
They work with this program.
The QK had it kind of up.
I don't care.
They pull around.
Finally got it all figured out or told so.
Pretty neat.
We have to do that.
Then we got our high-speed Internet.
So that's how you react on the stuff on it, I couldn't think of anything before I saw it.
Then it's summertime, so I don't even think of anything to do with it.
No pikes to the days that broke into the summer.
But yeah, so that's kind of where I've been lately.
Oh yeah, I guess.
Thanks.
I wasn't doing a lot of stuff.
This is what I did in my lesson here.
And I actually didn't sleep for two nights.
I'm not going to look.
Boy, is listening.
Yeah, looking for a homebrew waiting up to our mentor right now.
And I figured it out and it is $50.
And it should make five gallons of beer.
We shall see what qualities that would be.
Everybody's going to say that you could buy some better.
But we shall see.
So that was my thing.
The other thing was I was trying to get personal library
for the software three a day.
And I didn't have very good luck.
So I guess for a bit more I wouldn't call them again.
And then I would say they just asked out the mayor
what to do with all of you to participate.
Or we need to be able to offer him a location
which I don't have any knowledge or suggestions.
But it would be as good location as a library.
If people have an location then they may be able to
still September, right?
It is September, third week in September.
But the universities are open by then.
I've found what is typically what goes on in respect to members
and come in.
Or it is a promotion of the software.
So what you should do, you should register without on a website.
And it is a software free of day.
And you should say this is a team and this is our plan.
And I think first 300 teams they provide with support.
So they send some CDs.
Or they send some t-shirt on the road of work.
But you can do it on your own.
So the hardest portion is how to convince people
if you are giving them CDs that it's an amount of malware.
Some kind of virus.
So how I'm going to make a portion.
I'll always say, if we could say,
if they are going to target Windows users with a free software,
then we need to donate our own CD,
which is what they're looking for.
You're looking for us.
And I said, if I'm just Jack, I'll see you in the information.
I found out one, two, and he's looking at it.
Who's that?
The printouts.
So if you would have a vendor, I think you should know
that you can do it.
You can go there and just say,
who do you guys like to participate?
You know, maybe I want to pay $125 for 100.
Maybe I can move my employer and say,
this is for me, even.
I could put my employer like to participate
and just sort the way.
So if you don't have a venue, you can go in and you can, you know,
run out of money.
You know, pay more support or a little bit of money.
So, you know, we don't do it for money.
Most of the cost is what we want.
So anyway, we're just trying to make more work.
So if you were a musician,
you'd get seen from all that price,
nice little coins per year.
Yeah, they print, actually,
or even they print on my side,
where it's probably going to be.
Like that, dungeon.
You got a selfie?
Excuse me?
It's not a selfie?
It's not a selfie?
I don't think it's...
I get this, if you feel something about the CD,
because it unbalances the skin of the CD.
It's almost a printed one.
Really when we're doing commodity-over,
like $1.
Yeah, they'll just have like the one color or a couple color.
But it has a almost CD to it, not a selfie.
Is it?
I didn't either.
I should have almost seen it.
I thought most of them were that thermal print in film
that they did.
Yeah, I would just be afraid to wait with an Allen's Cassidy when it's too much.
Yeah.
I just write online within these levels and let's just make some stickers and stuff on there.
So, if I can actually, you know, draw up and put it in a library after I've opened it up.
So, I'm going to add some of this up here to use that.
A, which I'm also in a location, or you need to go there every day and say,
where is the person, where is he going to go here?
Is he going to work with me anymore?
Yeah, because I wrote an email and I said, who do you like that of the library?
Who do you partnership with?
Send them a letter.
Yeah, but...
And I was saying, well, all of what you do, you just provide a venue.
And we've sat in it, so I had a chair, and we looked at an empty bed.
And also, in full, the open-air library would have been in the castle.
But there's a lot of meeting spaces at the university level, and I said,
it's huge.
Or, you know, you always used to get there and then about to dance at some meetings.
You know, but it would be perfect.
It's like the university, you know, at the main McIntyre.
And I think the university, if you would have to do it probably on Friday,
covering the workplace.
Is the plenty of traffic throughout the weekend?
Oh, sure.
Because I thought, you know, it's like a coffee library.
There's actually a lot of traffic over the Saturday.
Well, I just can really use problems more at the public library than in the university.
I mean, it's hard to say.
There'll be a lot of students there, but they may be there for what they came to do.
And how much you can pull them away from what they're doing to do something else,
it's hard to say.
But on a weekend, that's the only time somebody used to add it to my university already
could find a place to park.
Yeah, that's true parking lot today.
Actually, my thing is, it's probably more appropriate for the public library
what you're trying to do here.
I mean, you're not really part target in the university community.
Yes.
I don't know exactly where the building is at the university.
Well, that part we can fill you in on pretty easy.
No, I think what your obvious orientation here is, which is a good one,
is that you should stay in a more, you know, o'clair venue
because there's always a separation between the communities there
and the community in town.
I mean, the free net, we tried for a long time to get under the university umbrella
and they weren't interested.
They really were not interested at all.
And we always thought that was a bad move on their part,
but you're not going to gain anything by trying to get yourself noticed
at the university.
It's not going to help at all.
And I hope that the library is doing something for the university.
So let's say here's an annual Cheapot of the Ellen Booktests.
And it is sponsored and also even organized by library.
Do you really want to stay in O'clair?
Because actually we had a lot of the free net meetings
were up at the library in Chippewa.
We just found that we got more people when we went up there.
So I mean, it's, you know, I mean, if you want to stay in O'clair,
I mean, you know, that's one thing, but if you want to go up there.
We split, you know, to make two different groups and one year,
and get one over there.
I mean, typically we would get like 25 to 40 people at meetings here in town.
And we'd get over 100 people at meetings up at the Chippewa Library.
The other place actually we've got some support.
And I don't know whether you've looked into these things at all.
Was it airs?
I don't know why, but they were interested.
Airs in that plastic place, they're out of business now,
over in that new, you know, that as you go to that little sky,
something or another, you know, as you get to the end of, you know,
if you turn by the athletic fields there,
or off a stone boulevard, and go all the way to the highway again,
there's like an industrial, there was a plastic place there.
And for some reason, yeah, we're not there anymore.
And I honestly, it's just, you know,
she talked in eight years ago, I can't remember.
Yeah, airs are so, the surveyors, you know, no, no, no, not airs,
but this was the plastics place, over by 35 there.
But for some reason, I think the guy who was, you know,
the manager there was trying to get Linux stuff going for his,
you know, to run the stepper motors on his machinery and stuff like that.
So maybe that's why he was interested in the Linux crowd coming over there.
But then again, you know, for some reason, airs too,
and I don't know why, but they would very often let us use their meeting areas
and stuff like that for trying to get meetings together.
So you might looking around and see if there's any, you know,
companies here in town that would be interested in somehow
affiliating themselves with the group too.
So let's first do the old library.
Yeah, we're suddenly not wrong with that,
and that's certainly a good place to do it.
They have a nice facility, it's a nice place to do it.
Would you be able to import two different places?
Why not?
I mean, you know, it depends on how much, how much you,
you know, maybe you want to try one this year and do two next year.
I mean, you know, I mean, how much does that mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean, it's certainly in terms of the ultimate direction to go,
you know, sure, why not?
Would we be able to staff through the public?
Oh, you mean simultaneously?
Yes.
I think you'd be better off doing it on two different dates,
maybe fairly close to one another,
but, you know, does it have to be on that specific day?
Yeah, same as one day in a year and so.
It's Saturday.
Saturday.
It's a temporary party.
I would try, you know, always is better to walk before you run.
So, you know, I would try one, you know,
and see how that goes and learn from that, you know,
if you, some things you'd want to do better.
I know that open a library is open on Saturdays
from 10 o'clock in the morning to five.
I don't know.
I mean, it's open.
It must be in the way, you know.
So, between the D there,
let's say like from, you know,
so yeah, there.
If you were taking there,
you could be there from 12 to 4.
It's four hours.
That's probably up.
That's your time.
As well as you know,
they tell you that you need to be in a basement room.
You don't have to be there,
because nobody actually broke down to a basement room.
So, you can't maybe just outside
and play guitars, you know.
Yeah.
So, that's all there.
If I play guitar on front,
you will have people in the basement in that room.
There's a lot of ways.
Well, just strategically placed guitar players
everywhere where we don't want the TV.
And we'll have to tell them,
okay, start playing once the person's past you.
So, they speed up.
They have the book sale every year.
The university has their friends
of the library, I think they're called.
They have their book sale.
It's in the basement room.
People don't seem to have any trouble finding the way in.
But people find books lower.
It's obvious that there's a free software.
Yeah, maybe.
It might be easier if this someplace really public.
Here you go.
Here you go.
You said public library in England,
really in town.
You know where it is.
It's an entrance.
It's like there.
So, you know what I mean?
Yes.
Okay.
It's in this building.
It's not possible.
It's not possible.

Okay, this presentation is on open source licenses.
Now, I didn't go through all the open source licenses
because we didn't want to be here until the next Tuesday.
So, I just went through a couple of the common ones.
And I guess what the license is, there's three main points.
And I don't understand two of them.
So, pretty much, while the two main points,
I meant to change that to or two.
I really do.
The derivative code, whether the derivative code has to be released or not,
that's one of the main points.
And that's called copy left.
And copy left is using copyright law to retain your freedom.
We'll talk about that in a second.
And then the other part is what is and isn't considered derivative code
versus the or with the dynamic linking and static linking.
So, what is copy left?
It is using copyright law to retain your freedom.
So, the copyright says the code, your code has to stay free.
Pretty much what the copy left license says.
Like the GPL or the CPL are two examples.
The GPL being the common one, it says that if you modify the code,
you have to release your changes back to the community.
So, it's using copyright in order to keep the code always free.
And others can sue if you don't follow copyright.
So, it forces you to release your code.
And it's actually more restrictive than something like a BSD style license
because the BSD style license doesn't restrict what you can do with it.
It's not a copy left license.
It doesn't say you have to release your changes if you can do whatever you want.
But, it forces the copy left forces companies to release their improvements to everyone.
But the BSD style, somebody can improve on it and that's it.
You'll never see the code again.
Apple.
Apple or Microsoft is actually BSD code in Windows.
Yeah, I mean, what?
I think they rewrote it for this.
See what I mean? It doesn't fit.
All right, the GNU GTL is sans for the GNU general public lens.
It's pretty much a leading OSS license.
And there are now three versions of it.
Version one, pretty much says vendors distributing the binaries must also distribute human readable source.
And the union of a GPL code and any other code must be released under GPL.
So that's what they're really talking about when it's saved.
The GPL is viral.
It's anything that the GPL touches is GPL.
So if you modify the GPL, if you put two pieces together, the whole thing goes to GPL.
I noticed you were listed earlier.
You got a dynamic inside it.
I think you might be talking about GPL as well.
Yep, that'll be the next one.
Version two, it's pretty much the same as version one,
except for it added a couple of clauses.
And the main one being that the license to the code is revolt.
If you can't follow the GPL, do the other copyright restrictions or other restrictions.
So pretty much it was at DRM and a little bit touching on the patent issue.
If you can't follow the GPL, you don't have a license to use it as well.
And the first one didn't say anything about that.
So it's just more of a clarification.
Right, some other legal requirement.
Like you could put something in the GPL, but you have some license that says that only you can use it.
Anybody who's using that, you know, they don't have the rights to it.
But this allows them to be licensed.
Right.
Now the version two was kind of confusing and there were some issues with it.
So they came up with version three.
And this is supposed to be the app well.
And version two.
Version two.
Yeah, version.
And that's what's going on.
I don't know what that was.
I don't know if that's the case.
Well, however, it won't be all I've written in a while, so it'll start at one.
Right.
So I don't think it's, I think it started on one and then went to you.
A little presentation.
Yeah.
So version three.
Pretty much added a few clauses to try and clean some of the stuff up and make things more free.
Pretty much it added a little bit better compatibility with some other licenses.
And it also clarified something to it even went more in-depth to say that if you cannot follow the GPL through to any other restrictions at all, then you can't use the GPL.
Or you don't have a license to the GPL.
So pretty much it'll eliminate the patented software that you put in GPL code.
If you put patented software in the GPL code, you have to also give a license to you.
A license to use that patent.
An unrevocable, what did they say?
Unrevocable.
I can't remember exact words, but you can't put patents in code in here.
And also a big thing.
Hardware must not restrict users from changing the GPL code, or from changing the GPL code so that you can all run their piece of software.
Pretty much you can't get the Tivo effect where they sign the binaries and you try and put a different binary on there.
That would be against the GPL version.
So the LGPL kind of follow along with the regular GPL.
It's the lesser general public license.
It's pretty much the same thing as the GPL except for the big difference is you can link from non-GPL software to LGPL software.
Otherwise, it's pretty much the same restrictions as GPL.
Now the thing is that has to be dynamically linked.
I've read some.
No, you cannot compile an instant.
You have to.
Right.
Compile by an engine so that if there is a flaw or a change of the program, it's more than likely to know who has to have a role.
Right.
And what I read was that if you're using the LGPL, you have to be able to take that, the LGPL code completely out of the program, or place it with something completely different in a program that's still run.
If you can do that, then you're in compliance with the LG.
And then obviously if you make any changes to that LGPL module, then you also have to release the source code to those changes.
The CPL common public license.
It's very similar to the GPL.
It's not almost the same.
Any changes to your code must be released, so it's a copy left license.
Contributors of patent code must grant a irrevocable royalty free license.
And it's incompatible with the LGPL because of a certain clause that says if there is some sort of conflict, you can only pursue it in this certain court.
It makes it not compatible with the GPL or the LGPL.
Otherwise, it's virtually the same thing as the LGPL.
But just because of that little clause, you can't copy code back and forth.
I believe IBM is the one who wrote it off.
And it's the same thing as the GPL.
Any code that you include into a CPL program becomes CPL.
So it's copy left similar to the GPL.
The Z-lib license is probably one of the most liberal licenses that you can have.
Pretty much the only things that it says is the author can't claim that they wrote the software.
So you can't say I wrote this software and you can't remove the license.
Other than that, go crazy and do whatever you want.
It's almost public domain.
Public domain will be you can claim you wrote it, you can remove the license you can buy anything.
This is the only thing is you can't remove the license and you can't claim you wrote it.
We know what is the issue with the public domain because somebody can take the code and license it under different license.
Yup and say it's there.
It's there.
And it's really something to be released about.
There's some sort of license there.
There's some license there.
There's some license there.
At that point, you know, they can save you.
If you can't claim that you wrote it, but get the original software.
But you don't get how can you prove that it's yours.
So like if somebody called the license group, could they remove the license from it?
Yeah, exactly.
How could you remove it?
So you can't see the data.
It's pretty much on the honors this year.
Well, it's there's really no way that this is on.
It's more of if somebody breaks it, they'll find a way to try and disprove it just for the fact that disproving it.
Because you're doing something with it.
Basically, it has two purposes.
One is it can be used with anything.
It can have every other license out there.
And two, you can't see it.
If you see it, it's probably going to be helpful.
It's going to work in a way.
So at that point, you wanted it to be free.
So the point was you capitalized into something and you capitalized into the department.
And the truth is that to get brought to Chicago,
what you wanted to do, you see that it was very highly used, truncant.
And you just capitalized into something like the department capitalized into something.
Realistically, you could probably say this is public domain.
Very, as well as close to you.
Close as you can get without actually doing it.
And probably the next least restrictive would be the BSD license.
It's generally free to use for whatever purpose you want as long as proper credit is given.
Right now, the current BSD license is referred to as a three clause license.
There's three clauses in the current BSD license.
The redistribution of source code must contain the original license and copyright.
Redistribution in binary form must be accompanied by the license and copyright and auxiliary file or whatever.
And contributors' names cannot be used to endorse products without their written consent.
Because apparently they were having issues with somebody who would write the code.
They'd see the name in there.
Hey, okay, well, this guy says that our code is the best.
And they were just using contributors' names.
So those were really the three main clauses of the BSD.
Otherwise, it's free to use in commercial for commercial purposes, modified however you want.
Close to you.
Assumption.
Berkley.
Software.
It doesn't actually require you to release the source code.
It does not require you to release the source.
No.
You don't.
You have to have the accessory file.
The accessory file just has to have the license and copyright.
Not the source.
That's slow.
Patchy is on the screen.
Patchy is on the screen.
They have their own license.
They have their own license.
It's very, very similar.
They're original.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually, I think I have your patchy license on here.
Another one, the MIT license, or actually X-11.
They prefer you call it X-11, but everybody calls it MIT.
But they say since MIT's got a bunch of licenses, you should probably refer to it as the X-11 license.
It's almost, it is the exact same thing as the BSD license.
But it doesn't have the no endorsement clause.
So it would be identical to a BSD-2 clause license.
So it's got the redistribution of source code.
It has to contain the license and copyright.
And redistribution and binary form has to have a license and copyright.
And that's really the only restrictions on the code.
And there are some modified X-11 licenses that also have a clause similar to the BSD license.
So really all of these BSD-based licenses are kind of muddy.
They'll have like the base license and then they'll have slight modifications that make them just like another license.
So they may say release under the X-11 or BSD license, but they're all generally the same thing.
And you'll have to specifically read that license to get the fine details.
The Apache one is very similar to the BSD license.
So it's a little bit more restrictive.
It includes all the clauses, just like the three clauses of the BSD license.
But it also includes one clause about patented code sections.
It says that any patented code sections must include a license from the patent holder to use those sections.
So it's virtually the BSD with the extra clause it says.
If you put patented code in, you have to be patent holder and you have to give a license.
Creative Commons is actually a group of software licenses.
Not one software license.
And it's actually not suggested to be used for code.
It's more for media.
You could use it for code, but again, they don't really suggest it.
And it's kind of confusing.
There are six different versions of Creative Commons that are in widespread use.
Attribution alone, which pretty much means you can do anything with it as long as you give proper attribution.
There's an attribution plus no derivatives, meaning that you can't modify it and you have to give attribution.
But you can use it.
There's a non-commercial clause that says you can modify it, but you can't use it in a commercial sense.
And there's share-like, which is very similar to a copy-left license, where any changes have to be released under the exact same license.
And then there's combinations of above parameters, where you have to give attribution.
You can't use it for commercial purposes, and you can't make derivatives of it.
Or you can't use it for commercial purposes, and you have to share it with everyone your modifications.
So realistically, the Creative Commons is kind of confusing in that manner.
If somebody says they released it under the Creative Commons, you really have to read into it to find out which one of those they actually meant.
And which one is actually released under.
So it may not be, you may not be able to just use it for whatever purpose you want.
So which license would you pick for recording?
Which license would you pick for recording?
No, not for commercial, share-like.
You can't use it for commercials, and anything you do has to be released.
That sounds like a good license.
Would it probably be that or just a non-commercial promise?
This would be, or like the act of the music itself, you say it?
Yes.
Not soft rocks.
So it's music, or...
Compotals.
You could be the old...
Most certainly electronic content.
Oh, as I mentioned, all right.
Your icon set for your PC.
That's mainly what this license is meant for.
The one problem this license runs into is dealing with follows.
It's kind of a lot increasingly when people are involved in follows.
You don't have the permission of license to license other people's inhibits.
I came up with...
Pretty much everything about lost things at once.
But the user also under create a talent license.
And I feel it was what company was.
Some major company created commercials with photos from Florida.
And it was all they released under the paid pounds by.
So they only had the attribute.
Which they did.
They provided the link.
And information.
What it was somebody else's photo that was posted.
If you had a person, it was the one.
Yes.
The original person who posted it did not have the right to post it on the flicker.
What?
They use as a creative cop.
Or...
Well, even they have a few who do it.
I should not throw some out of them.
There it is.
But...
They don't have the right to license it under a paid account license.
Technically, since flicker is a public site, you don't have the right to put it on flicker.
Because it is a public showing of somebody else's likeness.
You don't have the right to do it without their permission.
I don't think you're a profile.
I say only my body's can see it.
And it's private, though.
Yeah.
And it separates.
Yeah.
And I'll pick them.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Attribution,ssa.
Some show...
Go ahead.
Cut out our heads, make them float around in space, shoot them laser barns.
That's fine with me.
It could be licensed but whatever it will be, rockets, bullets, none of them is worth rice.
Right.
It's a price relies on 6 categories.
styles slightly.

If you want to license it under the creative comments, yes.
You can always put it in the public domain and then just
and then just do what you will with it. You don't have to attribute it or anything.
And this is not going to really work too well.
But I have a picture here of kind of which...
Well, it's got most of the one there.
Which licenses can actually go to which licenses.
You can see the Z-Lib over on the left is really the most free.
It can go to pretty much everything.
And then MIT is a little bit more restrictive.
It can't go back to the Z-Lib license.
And then BSD is probably the next most restrictive.
It can't go back to MIT or Z-Lib.
And then over on the right, you can't quite see that.
But it's got the GPL version one, two, and three.
And you can see this compatible with the Z-Lib.
With three, but it's not compatible with the rest.
Because Apache had that one clause that talked about patents.
Which made it not compatible with version one or version two.
So you can only change something from the Apache license to version three.
Which also with the GPL license, if it's...
If somebody has released under originally the same version one license,
then you can also license them with two and three.
However, if it's really something that's free, then not be licensed under two and a half.
Right. You can't see the arrows.
Right. And then you can also...
Right. You can also see that the CPL is pretty much both the same.
You can go from any of the BSD-style licenses to the CPL.
You can't go from the LGPL to the CPL because of that one clause about the court that you have to...
So the CPL is the installation as well as GPL is the installation.
Pretty much yes.
Once they're in CPL or GPL form, that's it.
There's really no place to go other than that.
And what do licenses need to you?
If you're not a programmer, probably not a whole lot.
Pretty much these open licenses only apply when you're distributing any modifications.
So you can use a program and even if you don't agree to the license,
it's completely okay.
As long as you don't distribute any changes, it doesn't matter.
And pretty much even if you're distributing pieces of software,
it doesn't matter.
As long as you're distributing an unmodified buyer and all the auxiliary files that are included.
So realistically, unless you're programming and looking to put pieces together,
you probably don't have to even look at what license it is.
As far as the open source license, obviously there are other...
So if you've got an idea of the source license, I'm going to push it that side.
Well, and then we'll push it that side.
So into ISO.
The Ubuntu ISO should have all the licensing rate on the ISO.
So by doing that, you are...
Right, and plus, since the ISO is an unmodified binary,
that will also have links back to their sites which have all the source.
You don't technically have to provide the source as long as you provide a link to the source from...
You don't have to have the source as long as it's an ability to state it in some way.
For at the library code, and I was asked to...
or source for...
I don't actually have to hold the source on my side.
You can host the source anywhere that you want as long as it's available.
So if it's a source for each site, you can host your...
the source on source for each and that's sufficient for the open licenses.
Here's the question.
When you program those little micro controllers and use it,
the Linux GCC program,
is that then asked me to release the code you want from the micro controller
not to be more than a product.
See, and there's been a few people who have taken it like that,
and have argued against that,
but the GCC has actually came out with the statement saying that
no any code that's created from the program is not licensed under the license of the program.
It would be the same thing for like an image manipulation program.
Right, so the image itself is not under the license of the given license.
At least with the given license the way it is.
I mean, they very well could put something in the license that is all...
Yeah.
But no, GCC does not...
The code does not go to...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, that makes sense.
So when you go to the local licenses,
I've got something...
I submitted a recording to...
Thank you for watching the half of the public radio.
