I have two up before you and you are going to have a dry cue for a while.
We are making Kima Prada and we have a 45% assembly line.
This is 50% whole week, 50% purpose flour.
We have bread and hot whole week with some dry milk and water.
They are being rolled out.
They are being rolled out.
Flat butter, folded in half, buttered again.
We divide 4 batches into 48 balls.
After buttering and buttering, they are rolled back out.
After they are judged, they are flat.
You take two of them and stuff a bunch of ground spice meat in between rolled and flat again after pitching the edge shut.
Then they are fried on the grill and served with a bunch of hot pastures and hot pastures.
Are you panicking watching this?
I hope these are watching.
I hope they were put away.
These are fresh.
We have a couple that you try to roll them all out and stack them.
That one is rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
They are rolled out.
Are they rolling out?
What is the third year of this?
We have just retake the production line going on.
We have one person rolling them out, one person buttering them, the first person rolls them back out again.
The third person stuffed meat and chicken rolls that cooked.
That was really fighting.
It was one of the big things about the toe
is you have to let it rest.
We did there was so much of it.
You don't let Joe rest it.
It bites you.
The glue is not stretched appropriately.
It becomes a spring step.
I have a little less.
That one rested in there.
A couple of hours.
We are going to use the muscles.
You have to tell that it was fighting.
I'm not going to sit up here.
We will change the process again.
I will be flat.
You put on a fold.
It is going to rest for a quick second.
We have a couple of different things.
We have to see the slide.
I believe that.
I don't know why.
We need to see the slide.
We are going to get it.
We can place something for the guys.
Somebody wanted to...
Where is the slide?
They are there.
I want to have some of you guys to take a look.
I just taking the first tray out.
All those guys sitting out there
with the table.
The faster it's getting first.
Not all of our stuff.
Is this butter?
You know?
It's from was.
Okay.
It doesn't, it's not butter.
It's not the end of the world.
It just doesn't taste this good.
Right.
Yes.
We're doing all this for flavor.
I mean, we could get some of the fat.
Oh, back to give it.
I like that.
This was butter.
I can see that.
Oh, that's fun.
I'm sure it's done with that.
I mean, I eat somebody else like fill and roll.
I've been trying to compliment their pumpkin past now.
It's really hot.
It's a shudder bug and they're back on the original job.
Tankinator.
He was doing a fill and I didn't have two more.
You know?
It's like bringing up just how it's going to work.
It's amazing.
You go to a house and it's like, oh, yeah.
It's fully stopped.
It's like, what's that mean?
What are these yours?
Over here.
Over here.
That's what's here.
Over here.
When you're bringing it this time.
Oh, that's coming in.
Pretty good.
You're going to cut up?
Yeah.
I don't want to do it.
I'm just using my bench scraper and try to make a whole ball.
Seven balls out of eight places.
The best you can.
Yeah, for the listers are.
We had several, several of these little pancake shaped
deals with the doughs, dough balls.
We all rolled out, but then we stacked them for the further processing.
They decided they were too attached to each other.
So yeah, you're going to.
When you stick out of the room, that's good.
Yeah, to do.
It's pretty nifty, though.
What was that mean?
What?
The camera.
That's probably three or four years old now.
They have a couple of neural models.
I have a built-in needle with it.
Expense to upgrade.
But my will send a shout-out to nag laugh.
The last one guy was currently installing camera right now.
Well, the rest of us live out his dream vacation.
2014.
It was in the picture, Jim.
I need some more butter.
I'm in post, though.
OK.
Go on, doctor.
Can I have some more butter?
I just need a butter, this.
When we're done eating, we all need to get together, you know?
Just make sure.
That's my question.
All I'm going to do is put that in really easy.
I guess it is.
I'm so glad I can hear the comments.
And all I'm going to be able to do is put it out.
There's meetings, meetings, and so should we put it straight?
Because everything is in the air.
So we haven't told the HPR audience who we are.
We, uh, we're the group that went to our cash plan at Y for 2014
on the Lord of Day weekend.
And, uh, been all day at, uh, no more amusement park.
We decided not to eat out so we came back.
Everybody with me, real, uh, real roller coasters all afternoon.
But I'm too big a chicken to, yep.
It's not my thing.
So I kind of do my own thing.
And a good time is had by all.
Yeah, that sizzling is going on.
And we're kind of jumping around a bit, but tomorrow we expect to, uh,
visit Centralia, Pennsylvania.
That'll be a fun show.
For those you don't know, this, this was a, uh, coal mining community.
Back in what the 1970s or 60s, something like that.
But the, uh, the whole coal field under the town.
Oh, I switched.
Oh, I switched.
Okay.
Sorry.
We haven't set up a smoke detector yet.
That's not all this time.
Uh, tanker, you even are odd.
Oh, this one.
Yeah.
Plus meat for the last one.
There's not enough.
Cut it down like 30 grams.
Yeah, we're worse than 50 grams.
That better.
Yeah, but it's not too much.
Sorry.
Yeah, the best, the best ally you have in a kitchen,
anything is a food scale.
Now, obviously, if you're doing this,
of course, I think you need to keep clarified butter,
but sort of in the middle of the farmhouse.
I don't have time to wear that butter.
It's to heat up towards boiling and to skim the milk some.
See, we're all eating fat.
I'm literally eating it.
I don't think there's only two people there.
Okay.
Tell me.
It's all good.
You can even use the spices beforehand.
Normally, it's like a multi-stage day where you spice the meat,
and then you...
I don't know.
You spice it.
You keep the oil.
Then you add spices then.
Add the onion and the garlic.
Let me just use any powders.
What?
I've got four balls, three rolled out,
and he's even.
So he doesn't need, because it's two perps,
so I'm actually done with it.
Where's the other one?
Apparently miscounted.
I was expecting a lot of it.
Maybe one of this kind of the blob there,
and it was actually eight perps,
or something like that.
Well, you don't need eight perps,
so we'll do that.
You get it.
You get it.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
But anyway, well,
a breakfast and some trillia,
the colonnate, the ground,
back about 40 years ago,
ignited as it's been today.
62?
Yeah, it's been here.
That's a little bit sick of it.
Almost 50 years.
Is it 16?
Yeah.
It's not trying to go on.
But the point is,
the coal underneath the town
ignited and has been burying ever since,
and the town really doesn't exist anymore.
The government moved them out.
Almost everybody.
And so what's left is an empty asphalt grid
that is being rapidly overgrown with plant life.
And if you can use,
if you can still live there,
there is an ambulance and fire station
that's still there.
And there's an abandoned section of Pennsylvania 61,
which is a wild ground for people.
It has a very interesting remix culture.
You go there,
you come back a couple months later,
and some of the graffiti that was left there,
has been sprayed over,
changed, remixed,
legalized,
people like homeless is there in there.
There's a rich,
you can't really sign your work,
and you can't really protect it.
I know.
People alternate and spray paint shades.
It's sort of de facto creative columns.
But actually,
you're interested in how a road is put together.
It's a fun place to open.
You can actually see it split open from the subsidence.
I don't know if you see any tomorrow,
but,
sometimes there's a good portion.
The coal catch is on fire.
You can see it's steaming.
Maybe I'll roast some marshmallows.
I wouldn't eat marshmallows.
And if this reminds anybody of a plot
for a horror movie,
you may have seen it once.
There's probably an inspiration,
but...
I don't know if I see it,
but two in a pointy half
with people on the sword.
Well,
I can't run very well.
All these people outrun me.
I'm the one who's going to get it.
It's probably fair.
I give it fair.
I give it fair.
I give it fair.
But I'm like,
he learned the last one.
Oh,
wash my hands, then.
Wow, awful.
It!
Wait, what?
What?
What's even on my?
Put it down there.
That's it.
Should I come up, sir?
Put that down there.
Can you put the view on it?
Let's put something in there.
What?
What?
Yeah.
No, no.
Just hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
There's a closet.
Put this me away, because the fridge is so cold.
It's gonna be so cold.
We're fine.
I managed to get it through the way.
Can we put this in the bathroom?
Yes.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...
The most important part of the preparation process is clean up afterwards.
Okay.
You need to be sarcastic.
How do I wash it?
You have wind up having to do it after you play a card because you manage it for several hours.
Yeah.
That would be a fun idea for a show.
A court, a card, and so on.
Oh no, you don't want to record them.
Why not?
You can't be as offensive as somebody has on record.
I never stop eating.
See, I was suggesting looking up the webcam and starting a Google Hangout.
Oh god.
That's just over the top.
Well, that's what's great of people who feel self-conscious.
Should we do something like that?
Let's come back.
Probably right.
Wouldn't bother me.
Someday you'll go in for a job.
You'll be like, why did you play that shit card?
Nice.
That would be easier.
That would be the best outcome.
That's what I would say.
So Ken, no card against humanity.
HPR.
Sorry, I tried to help him into it.
We just talked about it.
Because it's not fun to hear other people play cards.
You want to play wisdom?
Yeah, that's the experience we had on on KPO.
There's a way to do it through IRC that we failed.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't leave the meat.
Can you like this one?
Yes.
It's fun being in a farmhouse with a little automatic ignition.
How many last few minutes I should guard in the water?
Just the front.
We probably about as much as the HPR audience can stand.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, the recipe will be in the show now so you try it yourself.
Okay, so the HPR and Mr. and Mrs. American, all the shifts at C,
we're signing up from Saturday night.
They all have plenty of live.
Memorial Day weekend, 2014.
Pre-30 Peggy and last known guys really should have been here.
