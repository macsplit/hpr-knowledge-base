This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3853 for Wednesday the 10th of May 2023.
Today's show is entitled, creating a prompt for chat GPT to generate an HPR show.
It is the 70th show of Mr. X, and is about 10 minutes long.
It carries an explicit flag.
The summary is, a rushed episode going over the steps I used to create a chat GPT prompt
to generate an HPR episode.
Hello and welcome, Hacker Public Radio News.
I welcome to this podcast.
My name is Mr. X. As usual, I'd like to start by thanking the people at HPR for making
the service available to us all on these here introduced.
Hacker Public Radio is a community-led podcast provided by the community for the community.
That means you can get a bit too.
Why don't you pick up a microphone, a mobile phone, a tablet.
Well, you've got the hand MP3 recorder, anything, and a send in a show.
If I can do it anyone can, I'm worried about it.
We're having short and short recently, and I'm sure you must have something interesting
you can send in.
In this episode, I decided to see if I could get chat GPT to generate an HPR episode about
itself.
I wasn't initially reluctant to do this.
However, since HPR was recently short on shows, and I was short on time and ideas, I
decided to give it a go.
One reason for my reluctance was that I didn't want HPR to flooded with shows generated
by chat GPT.
The other reason being that a great show covering chat GPT was previously provided by the HPR
host DNT, entitled Chatbot hallucinations, referred to HPR 3801, in comparison, my poor
attempt took about 10 minutes to generate, while I was waiting to be called for lunch.
All other steps I used to generate a prompt that I gave to chat GPT, and was to ultimately
generate an HPR show.
You interface with chat GPT by providing prompts.
This just means typing some text into the input field within the chat GPT website.
Here's how I did it.
Keep in mind that the complete process took just 10 minutes.
I visited the chat GPT website at chat.openai.com, then I copied and posted the following prompt
into chat GPT text input field.
The prompt came from a video I found on YouTube, I'll include the link to the video in the
show notes.
So the prompt was, I want you to become my prompt creator.
Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs.
The prompt will be used by you, chat GPT.
You will follow the following process.
One, your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about.
I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations
by going through the next steps.
Two, based on my input, you will generate three sections, A, revise prompt, provide your
written prompt, it should be clear, concise and easily understood by you, B, suggestions,
provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it.
C, questions, ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed
from me to improve the prompt.
Three, we will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information
to you and you updating the prompt in the revised prompt section until it is complete.
Chat GPT responded with, sounds like a fun and collaborative process, what should the
prompt be about.
I replied with the following prompt.
Write a show for the hacker public radio podcast describing the history and use of chat
GPT, includes some examples about what it can be used for, also includes some relevant
web links about chat GPT.
Chat GPT responded with, great, based on your input, here are the revised prompt suggestions
and questions for further clarification, revised prompt.
Could the hacker public radio podcast episode that explores the history and application of
chat GPT share examples of how chat GPT can be used and include relevant web links for
listeners to learn more, suggestions.
Consider including information about the development of chat GPT such as who created it and when.
Provide a clear and concise example of how chat GPT could be used in various industries
and fields such as customer services, content creation and chatbots, highlight the benefits
and limitations of using chat GPT, including its ability to learn and adapt to user inputs
and the potential ethical concerns surrounding its use.
For relevant web links such as the official OpenAI website and articles about the latest
developments in chat GPT technology, questions, is there a specific angle or focus you want
to take in exploring this history and applications of chat GPT, do you have any specific examples
or use cases of chat GPT that you would like to be included in the podcast episode, how
the technical should the podcast be, should it cater to a more general audience or dive
into more technical details.
I replied with the following revised prompt.
Could the hacker public radio podcast, or before I start bearing it mind, a more or less
just copied the stuff up above with minimal tweaking, could the hacker public radio podcast
episode that explores the history and application of chat GPT share examples of how chat GPT
can be used and include relevant web links for listeners to learn more, including information
about the development of chat GPT such as who created it and when.
Provide clear and concise examples of how chat GPT can be used in various industries
and fields such as customer services, content creation and chatbots.
Highlight the benefits and limitations of using chat GPT, including its ability to learn
and adapt to user inputs and the potential ethical concerns surrounding its use.
In relevant web links such as official OpenAI website and articles about the latest developments
in chat GPT technology, the show is mainly aimed at hobbyists, many of the listeners will
have Linux experience and IT experience, some listeners may have some programming experience.
The article should cater for both a general audience while also diving into more technical
details, format the article using Markdown as required.
Chat GPT responded with revised prompt.
The Hacker Public Radio podcast episode exploring the history and application of chat GPT
nattifish intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, the chat GPT has become increasingly
popular due to its ability to understand and generate human like text, this application
span a wide range of industries and fields, and this episode will dive into the deliverance
of chat GPT including who created it and when we will explore the technology behind it
how it has evolved over time.
We will also provide clear and concise examples of how chat GPT can be used in various industries
and fields such as customer services, content creation and chatbots.
For example chat GPT can be used to generate personalities or sponsors to customer inquiries
in real time, create high quality content for websites and social media platforms and power
chatbots that consist of a range of tasks, and this in which we will highlight the benefits
and limitations of using chatbot, including its ability to learn and adapt to users input
and the potential ethical concerns surrounding its use.
As chat GPT can use to grow in popularity it is important to consider the implications
of using AI technology that can generate human like text such as the potential for bias
and misinformation.
To provide lessons with more information we will include relevant web links such as the
official OpenAI website and articles about the latest developments in chat GPT technology.
This episode will cater to a general audience who are also diving into more technical details
for lessons with Linux, IT and programming experience.
The article will be formatted using Markdown as required.
Suggestions.
Consider including interviews with experts in the field of AI or individuals who have used
chat GPT in their work.
The real world examples of how chat GPT has been used in various industries and fields
discuss the potential future applications of chat GPT and whether technology may be
headed.
Adjust any concerns, misconceptions or concerns about the use of AI language models like
chat GPT.
Questions.
Is there a specific length you would like the episode to be, are there any specific individuals
or companies you would like us to feature in this episode?
Is there any particular tone or style you would like us to use for podcast episodes?
I stopped at this point and decided not to take any unborded further suggestions as I
was limited in time.
So I didn't bother offending it anymore.
As I mentioned, the whole process just took 10 minutes, it was so easy.
So I think I've also included in the show a general link to an article about chat GPT
from Wikipedia again.
It took seconds to find, and I also find an interesting TED talk which gives some of
the background of the development of chat GPT by Greg Brockman.
So in my next show, I'll actually provide the episode that chat GPT generated.
So stay tuned for part two.
And finally, if you want to contact me, I can be contacted at MrX at hpr.googlemail.com.
That's MRX, AT, HPR, the at symbol, googlemail.com.
Until next time, thank you, and goodbye.
