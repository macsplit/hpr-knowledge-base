Hi everybody, this is Ken. As you know 5150 is put together a special show with

episode will be aired this Friday, so in order to allow him time to edit the show
if you have not done so already, could you please send in your greeting to
episode 1000 at hackerpublicradio.org. You can record it in any format and just
send it on in. So that's the last chance to get your greetings in for our
special episode 1000 episode. Thank you.
Good day, and welcome to Hacker Public Radio. My name's Jay W. This is my first
song calling the UK line. I know I can send it off by the can, but I just wanted to see
it that it was going to walk around. What I wanted to talk to you today was about
what I wanted to talk to you today about what's the Linux command line. It goes on a new
Linux command reference out to you. The Linux 2G comes up, it's from Frostwire, the
one from Frostwire. They have a little 2G to help you out with all the things, and particularly
it has a good for the toss, so you see, you know, you have a year that Dan, let's go and
Dan, when you want to talk about how this, you can have it. What I particularly wanted to talk
about today was, you know, when I log into my Linux, I manage a lot from the command line
at work, and so a lot of times I'll forget what day it is on that day. And I need to know how
the calendar looks for the month install.com. So day to day, do the time thing. If it's a
Linux system to work, I talk about time to see if it shows how many days it's been up.
And sometimes I need to know what kind of once running out, and it will be, we can do a
run name, minus A, it's a kernel information. And then, if you need to know about the CPU
and memory, you can use CAD, space, clock, sorry, CAD, a forward slash, a
forward slash CPU, info to get your CPU from. And the same thing, CAD, a forward slash
info to get your memory info. Now, your DEU will show the directory of space usage
and your DEU will show the disk usage. If you type free, it will show the memory
and swap usage and everything. Well, this is JW, and if you can contact me, it's
www.p5.com. We all have a great and fantastic day. All righty.
