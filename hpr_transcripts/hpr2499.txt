9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, I've worked you over 16 meters
last year twice, and lovely to meet you on forty quite unexpectedly, a good morning
on this side, Roth. Name Tom, I thank you. I've got that okay already. Anyway, located in southwestern
Delta Lima, look too far away from the city of Stuttgart. So back to Europe,
Victor Kilo to X3 Zulu, Delta Florida to Blue Ocean. Seven, one, six, two, zero, zero.
Okay, very good, very good drop, Victor Kilo to X3 Zulu, Delta Florida to Blue Ocean returning.
And thank you for the five and nine report drop. You're peaking at seven. Speaking in S7,
we're in daylight now by one hour and 50, one hour five zero minutes. So the daylight absorption
certainly is working a bit on us already, but the number list, the signal is still coming through
very nicely from you there, Roth. About 15 meters totally shot here, even 20 is completely
dead. We have a strong geomagnetic disturbance. So with that, all the other bands are completely wiped
out, at least up here in this part of Europe, maybe the Italians and Spanish people might have
a bit of propagation, but up here there is absolutely nothing dead. I'm operating with an icon
Pro3, pushing the 211M, and the antenna here at my end is a Yagi combo. It's two elements on 80
and three elements on 40, two on 80, three on 40, and the antenna is up at around 88 and a half
feet pointed right on you via the long path. A very nice morning, a little bit on the fresh
side, still that we're looking forward to a nice golden October weekend with the afternoon
temperature of 21-22C. The sky is totally blue already and to the sun is shining just that it
was pretty fresh last night. It was just at about four times degrees Celsius, so a very fresh
morning that we had some hours ago. It actually comes to Europe, a Vector kilo to X-ray
Nulu, Delta-Slaury-2 Blue Oceans. We're going to continue the assembly. Excellent transmission
rope, excellent. Vector kilo to X-ray, so Delta-Slaury-2 Blue Oceans. Returning very fine rope and
oil, a half-waste, I will app it, that's already something decent, and so I wonder you're
coming through so nicely considering how much I'm in daylight and what relatively poor conditions
we have today with the Geomagnetic disturbance that are cruising around. The off-air alpha came
back to my call, the 084 German in Lima, Gustavo, but we can check if he is still around by any
chance at Gustavo, Oscar America for German in Lima. Are you still there? No, no, he's not, he might
have gone to bed again. Sorry that you didn't call in, and like VK2S, I read that you just
called in and asked to have a cue with him, I certainly would have been delighted to let you have
this contact with him and make a new country probably. Okay, in any case, Ross, thank you so much
for replying to the call. Very wonderful, very great to work you the first time here on the 40 meter
band, and I do hope to find you on this band a bit more often. I'm a very active 40 meter DXR,
probably my main band of operation. It's a wonderful band to both months throughout the year.
You can work the X in the night and at around sunrise and sunset times, so it's a wonderful,
wonderful DX band and not suffering that much from geometric disturbances it does, but not as much as
20 up to 10. Take care Rob, have a very good evening there at your end, an enjoyable weekend,
and until the next time. Victor Kilo, two X-rays, Zulu, Delta, Florida, two blue oceans. Thank you Rob.
Good morning, Ross. Thank you very much and until the next time. Bye-bye.
What's it again? What's it you again, Chris?
Oh my goodness, you're also way way up into the red now. It's amazing. I'm almost to ours in
daylight here, but you're of course getting closer to your sunset, so that it may be a little bit
more of the essence compared to me being more in daylight, Chris. Go ahead.
Wonderful, Chris. Wonderful. It's sounding just awesome and good time over nine year at my end,
so thank you very much for the have been over the band. It's obviously speaking now into VK
to land, and it doesn't matter that I'm so much in daylight and unfortunately the activity is
very low today, Chris, that there are stations on, but not as many as even during the week, which
is pretty surprising to me. I would have expected on a weekend that there would be way more people
around, but they seem to do something else or just stay away from the band seeing the figures.
Again, Chris, you take care. Booming signal and just a fantastic audio.
Victor Piro 2, show the radio. Delta Florida 2, blue ocean by.
Good morning, Chris. Anybody else from the KZL long past? Delta Florida 2, blue ocean.
Okay, now nobody on there. This is what I said, no activity. Okay, so one more time,
like I said, five minutes ago or so, but morning to everybody still listening.
Have an enjoyable weekend, be it to be all closing down.
Chapter 33, at first line, because of its mother, I have not seen her,
acknowledged his mother, her mother's and children, from the heart of her two words,
they kept your problem. They shall preach, drink up your judgment,
your nature, or your wrath. They shall put themselves between you and
up on a pack of paper, or a cup of water. They'll have to touch them from the
back side of the table. So it's so long for them to round against him,
and I've done it to his hands, so they write it not again.
God bless your graphics there. We'll just show you what it's been doing there.
