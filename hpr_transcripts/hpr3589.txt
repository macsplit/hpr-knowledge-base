This is Hacker Public Radio Episode 3589 for Thursday 5 May 2022.
Today's show is entitled, Sample of My Microphones.
It is hosted by Archive 72 and is about 7 minutes long.
It carries a clean flag.
The summary is,
microphones I have around the apartment.
Hello, this is Archive 72 and in this episode I sample some of my microphones around the apartment.
This one I picked up the Tuzzle T9 and all of these are between 15 and 30 dollars on microphones I've been using.
This particular one is a Bluetooth and I wanted to try it because I've seen people at work that have these same types of earpieces.
I thought it would be good to try it recording on it too.
This earpiece comes with its charging case and connects pretty quickly so it makes it convenient to pick up if I want to listen to a podcast around the house.
Last time I tried to record there was a glitch in the audio recorder that I'm using on the phone and so I lost what I had done.
It was rainy day and it is again and I'm going to see how the nature sounds and I've got some pretty happy birds outside so I'll see how they sound.
Unfortunately all I can capture at 6.45 in the morning is a bunch of traffic in the distance.
This light sound of the dripping of the downspouts.
My next microphone is the one built in to the Moto G power. I got to get this phone after the other one stopped being able to multitask.
I really like the battery on this. It lasts two days on a charge at the longest and that's longer than any phone I've had.
Hopefully this sounds pretty good. We'll see how it comes out.
As with the Tozo earbud I am recording this on using the Auto Recorder app on Afteroid.
So next is my laptop microphone and it's an Acer Aspire Slim and since I don't have a lot else to say about that I'll read the BSD license.
BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software.
This is in contrast to the copy left licenses which have share-like requirements.
The original BSD was used for its name tag, the Berkeley software distribution and as a Unix-like operating system.
The original version has been since been revised and it's descendants are referred as a modified BSD license.
I picked up this next mic in the local office supply store.
Here in the States it's called Office Depot and it used to be called Office Max.
Actually I think that there were two separate stores and they combined.
I think the brand is Memrex but I'm not quite sure anymore.
I'll come back with my MPOW headset and which is the last one shortly.
It should be quieter now. It's about 6.15 in the morning so I'll track because I'm going as much as I was yesterday.
This is the first time I've ever seen a BSD license.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
I think it's about 6.15 in the morning.
There was just a sample from my last headset MPOW.
I believe I got it off Amazon.
That is all I have for this microphone or headset.
I'll leave you with four BSD license clauses.
