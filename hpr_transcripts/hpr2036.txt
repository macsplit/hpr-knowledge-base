Hello hello and welcome to HPR special on an upcoming event.
Now this should be the social event of the year and the certainly north of the board.
And we're going to talk about Pond Crawl Glasgow 2016.
I'm Kavi, joined tonight by Dave, how are you tonight Dave?
Hi Kavi, I'm great, thank you.
This will now be the third year of Pond Crawl Glasgow and in fact last year was your first year, wasn't it Dave?
It was, yeah, yeah, it was, it was fun actually.
It was fun, I tracked the vast distance from Edinburgh to Glasgow, half an hour on the bus.
It's pretty good, it's pretty good.
There's a lot of people who go to and from Glasgow, so there's lots and lots of transport between the two.
Yeah, it was great, it's a really good way to meet people and get out and have a few jars and a chat.
Yes indeed.
I suppose yeah, we'd better start with the what it is, of course.
Well, it doesn't really take too much of a Sherlock Holmes to figure out what Pond Crawl is.
So was that the first Pond Crawl you'd actually been to Dave?
Yes, it was.
Yes, yes, I've never been to anything quite like that before.
Yes, so it is literally aimed, I'm not going to say exclusive, I mean it's mainly aimed at podcasters and also people who appear on podcasters.
So I put, I mean that is maybe local bands, musicians, anything like that.
So yeah, aimed at them and just having one or two island blue, of course, you know, nothing much stronger.
No, I'm only kidding.
Yes, one or two, one or two jars of five days, because every bar we have a policy of, they must sell really ill and they must also, if they play music, it's got to be low down.
So really, if you're in for a raving night on the lager, you know, this ain't your prsina at all.
Well, it's a bit of a relief for me, I must admit, because I'm not that sort of person over it.
No, even in my younger days, I wasn't that sort of person.
I always like to go to the pub for a year and not, I was never one for the whole club, Blancin and the load music, whatever.
You just couldn't hear yourself talk.
Yeah, no, I know.
Much as I love all camp, the social events at last year's all camp, we're in a very, very, very loud sort of club type places and surprise a number of people who just sort of disappeared outside and stood out on the street chatting because it is impossible to hold much of a conversation inside, you know, so lots of people think that way, I think.
The worrying thing is you're probably more encouraging people just to take up smoking as they have an excuse to go outside.
That happened to you.
Yeah, I can't believe it.
So, yeah, so we're going to meet in no surprise in Glasgow. Yes, it's Glasgow City Centre.
And the place we're going to meet at is the State Bar.
And that is in Holland Street.
Now, if you're not really sure where that is, it's in Sochi, it's just off Sochi Hall Street, it's perpendicular to Sochi Hall Street.
If you're heading from walking down from the pedestrianized area of Sochi Hall Street, just keep on going until essentially you see a bar with loads of flags at it.
It's called the campus bars of students, but that's on your right hand side.
It's just a wee bit further down and on the left is Holland Street.
But just in case people aren't so familiar with Glasgow, I did post, I made a blog post about this.
And I put our map on it, which shows where the bar is in comparison to the booth of train stations and the bus stations.
So, to be honest, it's not that difficult to get to from all three.
No, I can vouch for that.
I had no idea where it was when I came in on the bus last year, but it was very, very easy.
Especially with Open Street map on the phone and everything.
It was pretty simple to find, have to say.
Yes, and even if you get to the wrong end of Holland Street, Holland Street is really not that long either.
Yeah, it's a handy place.
It's close enough to all of those amenities.
So even if you were coming in from the airport, you'd probably come in to the bus station, I guess, if you come in from the airport.
So it would not be very far away from there either, would it?
No, there are slightly closer places, but you'd have to kind of know Glasgow.
I would probably recommend if you're coming in from the airport, you could probably nip off somewhere along Hope Street.
Probably slightly there towards the upper end of Hope Street and you can get to it that way.
So, but even it's very, very easy, as I said, and the easiest way is just go to kevy.co.uk
And I put it this way, I don't exactly blog post very much these days.
So chances are there will be one of the most recent blog posts.
Oh, that's useful.
Yeah, yeah.
And having some sort of a guide or a map is good just to get people heading off in the right direction and so on.
Yes, indeed.
So now, of course, you get to the bar.
You may think, I don't know what any of these guys look like.
Well, we've got an easy spot for that.
There's three people now, Dave's chicken died for some reason.
I don't know why, but there's three of us who are going to be waiting t-shirts with the logo, which is slightly different this year.
I went for a slightly different logo.
The logo for Glasgow pod crawl and her names on the back of it and the three people are myself.
That's going to have kevy on the back.
Andrew, who I do tux jam with, he is going to have McNalloo, MCNALU.
And Andrew Gregory is just going to have Andrew on the back of his.
So if you see any of us, there you go.
You know that you're in the right place.
Yeah, I never met you guys before and I certainly found you,
Mind you, you were right close to the door and you were watching out with people and stuff.
And I don't know who spotted who first and when I came in that I thought, those guys look like they might.
Ah, yes, yes, these are, these are them.
Yes, well, I've just realized we've got the, we've got the where, we've got the Horde, but we haven't got the when.
So it is going to be July the 29th, which is a Friday, and it's going to kick off at 6 p.m.
That's in the Steve bat.
That's good. That's good.
Yeah, that was pretty much the time we did last.
Last year, wasn't it?
6, yeah, it was, wasn't it?
Yes, it was. 6 o'clock.
Well, I'm just using that because it's if people want to come along just for one or two, that's fine.
I don't know why you would write enough, but you know, you are welcome to come for one or two at 6 o'clock.
But also, I mean, it's a decent enough nightmare.
I think last time it went on till.
It went on till I think about midnight.
Ish.
And then there was a, we continued myself and McNally continued the party back at his house.
Yes, yes, I was well out of the way by then.
I, my energy is not what it used to be when I was younger.
So I ducked out earlier.
Still a lot of fun, mate.
Well, I must admit, I'll tell you one thing that's killed us off.
Andrew killed us off.
Andrew McNally, that is killed us all off by, we had been to a few different bars.
And then he says, right, we're going to the three judges in party.
It's under Barton Roode.
They have the world's most amazing pork pies.
And I actually, to be fair, I don't actually see that.
He said they had very good pork pies.
I think when I was with a few more beers and it, yeah, these are amazing.
But we had there and they were very, very good.
They were butcher pork pies and they were quite a size.
Oh, my words.
See, after eating these, I just couldn't drink any more beer.
I was so full and my head started to go down with this is crazy.
What's, what's knocked you out?
Not a beer, not a whiskey, a pork pie.
I'm, I'm envisaging something about the size of a small car wheel or something that you two and you went through there.
No, not quite that bad.
It's, it was certainly, you know, if you go and get one in the local supermarket,
you get, there's obviously the mini pork pies.
And then there's the ones that are kind of meant to be like a fool or almost like a meal in itself, kind of.
Yes.
You know, I just, you know, from your description, I had to, you know, like sort of two hands had to have to hold it
and get some help of somebody else to have a thing.
No, well, that's probably, probably, did feel like after all the beer we had.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, that was good.
Did you, did you go to eat before you, before you met at six?
That was one of the things that I was asking you about last year.
Did, did you, did, did you eat before?
Did you eat on the way?
I ate before I went only because on the first year, we were running late myself and...
I'm just going to say, I'll just say, if I'm referring to Andrew, I call him McNally,
there's too many hands this year.
The first year went, myself and McNally ran short a time and we had to race to the bar
and we hadn't eaten anything.
I know after two drinks, we're like, hey, we've got to eat something.
We're going to be found asleep at eight o'clock if we don't.
So, wait, that's...
Yes, this time I had something before going there.
That one good thing about Glasgow is there's plenty of places if you want to go eat.
It's also plenty of chippies and things like that.
You can catch something on the go.
There's, when you come out of both central Queen Street and Buchanan Street bus station,
there is basically am Macdonalds or one of the other fast food joints.
More or less within a hundred yards are you leaving the stations?
Yeah, I had no trouble.
I found a Chinese place just to stop the road towards the state bar and dropped in there for something quick.
There were people restaurants catering for their show and cinema theatre trade and stuff
prepared to give you something relatively small quickly.
That's plenty of that at that time of the evening.
Yes, indeed.
And the other good thing about it is the state doesn't as far as I'm aware,
but a lot of the bars in Glasgow do very good pub grab as well.
Even if you wanted to go a bit earlier, you certainly couldn't get a meal before 6 o'clock.
Certainly plenty of them serve food from basically all day after, from end time after midday.
Yeah, it is.
I mean, it's a sort of city where there will be plenty of all sorts of food out there.
So it's not really a big issue and it's not as if the state bar is far away from those sorts of places.
Right.
No, not at all.
In fact, if I remember rightly, I think that the corner between Holland Street and Sochi Holstead,
I'm not 100% sure if you want to see the corner or maybe the next one.
Am I not sure if it is that should be on the corner because that's from herself and Macnaloo.
That should be two years ago because we just went to the closest place to get something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I think people can just work that I was just wondering if we should be pointing places out,
but that would be a big task, wouldn't it?
Yes, it would be.
And the problem is with me not living in Glasgow.
I obviously, I live in the Isle of Lewis now, so I'm only down every so often.
And places with one thing you find is places that some used to sell good food or sometimes sold food,
sometimes stock selling food.
One of the places we were in the port still, two years ago, we didn't call last year,
two years ago, went to the port still.
And they used to sell good beer.
I said, they still sell good beer.
They used to sell great pub club because I remember been in there one time and had...
I can't remember.
I think it was like a mini mixed grill and I had it with the pie to relay.
And I remember thinking this was absolutely perfect.
But then I went in there two years ago, not the night of the port club,
but that same week I went in there to get something to eat.
Oh, we don't sell food.
And I was like, ah.
That's a shame.
Yeah, yeah.
I suppose it happens.
But yeah, a lot of places do sell food these days.
So as you said, there should be plenty of other places to choose from.
Yes, indeed.
But of course, we're not staying there all night.
So what we're going to do is we're on video social media.
We may even get someone on Facebook this year.
I don't know, I'm not.
But so what we're going to do is we're going to use the hashtag podcrawlglasgo.
So if you're not sure, if you're thinking, oh, Dash, I didn't get into eight o'clock,
hashtag podcrawlglasgo and just do a search.
I will update on Twitter and GNU social.
And I'll try my best for days, but as well.
Although diaspora for some reason lately has been a bit unusable on the.
On a slow data connection, you have to more or less have your Wi-Fi on.
So I will try my best on that.
If somebody's on Facebook, I'll tell them to post.
But unfortunately, just due to the.
What's what I'm looking for the target market is probably not going to be a lot of Facebook users among us.
Yeah, I would imagine that's true.
Certainly not one myself.
So yeah.
Yes, indeed.
So we're not going to stay, like I said, in the state battle night.
Actually, it wouldn't bother me.
It's a good bad.
But I suppose people want to see more than one place.
Yeah, I enjoyed the variety.
Well, as I said, I didn't come with you to all of them.
But the ones that I saw are certainly some interesting places and some interesting different whiskies
that have other tipples available at the different places.
Yeah, that's the fun of it, I think.
Yes, indeed.
Of course, you don't have to be drinking beer on this.
You can, as you said, you can also enjoy whisky.
And there's a whole variety now.
Well, that's one thing I must admit that I would like to see on this year's podcast.
Is more of the kind of more localized stuff.
I'm just meaning just things like, well, there's an Aberdeen company now doing rum.
And there's, I have a funny feeling there's a vodka.
I've been brewed and orchard.
You distilled and scottling there as well, somewhat.
I wonder if we'll see many of those things.
That's interesting.
Yeah, yeah.
I went to a place in Edinburgh called Summer Hall, which is the old veterinary school,
which is now a place where the Edinburgh Science Festival has its venue.
And they have a gin distillery in there that you can get little tours around,
and a wee sample as well.
So, yeah, Anna Brewery, it's got a little brewery as well.
Barney's ails, I think it's called.
So, yeah, yeah, it's great to see all these things happening.
People making all manner of interesting stuff like that.
Yes, that's it.
So, yeah, so if you, you know, if you feel like this could be something,
then we'd love to see you there.
So, so far, the confirmed ones are myself and yourself date, all been well.
And there's McNalloo and Andrew Gregory.
There's a few more, but I'm not going to say any because basically I've not asked the permission.
And I don't want to, I don't want to say something and then something happens.
So, but hopefully there should be quite a good clue there this year.
I have a pal who I mentioned this to last year.
And he couldn't actually come along last year, but it might be available this time.
That it's open to sort of, you know, significant others and friends and acquaintances as well.
I'm sure, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
I mean, we're not going to stop anybody from coming.
I mean, let's be honest, it's anybody who, you know, it's not just for podcasters.
It's anybody listens to podcasts, anybody who's maybe been involved in one,
but anybody who's got a general interest even in the subjects.
I mean, it's really that there's no nobody we would want to exclude.
The maybe accept that a pill pop in teeny raver, but, you know, really,
I don't, I don't want to come to a reveal behind it, which to be honest.
No, no, not with the likes of us.
And it's probably a good thing for somebody who is interested in the prospect of getting into podcasting.
I say that because my pal Tom is quite keen to do something, you know, contribute to HBR
or do something of his own or something like that.
So, you know, it's nothing quite like being able to chat to people already into that type of thing
to give you some pointers in the right direction.
Oh, yes, definitely.
And the one thing I will say to anybody who's thinking of getting involved in it
is that whatever you can think of, it doesn't seem to matter how niche it might be.
It probably already is a podcast somewhere in the world that covers it.
That's true.
You know, there is so many.
So, you know, it's good to actually get a whole variety of people there.
So, if you think you have a great idea for a podcast, you know, please come along.
I mean, if nothing else, it will build up your listener base because you'll already be telling us
about it and we'll be looking out for it.
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.
Yeah, you get an audience to start off.
That would be a good way to head off into that world.
Yeah, great idea.
One thing that is worth noting, and this is maybe to listeners from outside of Scotland,
because I certainly know on the conscience, and even in England,
it's kind of quite normed to a family barge.
Licensing laws in Scotland are quite different.
Children are welcome in some bars, but very often only, I'm still a bit seven o'clock,
and it's only with a meal.
So, although they're called public houses, they're really only public houses for the over 18.
So, I would recommend that if you've got a family, it may be better to get to maybe have a babysitter for that night.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The sort of bars we're going to, and not going to be a particularly child-friendly there.
They're pretty adult-friendly, but they're not really geared up for children, are they?
Well, to be honest, I think that's just generally a lot of bars in Scotland.
I mean, we don't have the culture of the Europeans, really, where it's a norm for the whole family to be out.
I mean, it's still a bit alien to us.
We still, to be honest, it's still actually quite alien to a certain lot of the bars we go to to see too many females.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can believe that too.
That's it.
Straits.
Yeah, yeah.
Although, to be honest, I would love to see some females here this year, because you'd be the first ever females at Podcrol Glasgow.
We've had exclusively males the last two years.
Well, that would be good, yes.
It's a thing that should be pushed against, not that we're exclusive in any way,
but there is something about pub culture in some parts of the world that, you know,
it doesn't seem all that welcoming if you're female, but hopefully we will be very welcoming.
And we will try our best to be as welcoming as to whatever you are.
Just, please be over 18, otherwise we'll make a chuck digs.
Yes.
Well, is there anything else you would like to add? Is there anything I've forgotten?
I can't think of anything else, actually, Kevin.
I think we covered all of the issues that we thought about last year,
and then had sort of extra thoughts about afterwards and so on.
I can't think of anything else to add to it.
Just, you know, everybody is very welcome, and we look forward to seeing you.
Yes, indeed.
And if there are any further questions, one thing I've just told you,
if there's any further questions, then please feel free to contact me.
Now, because we're currently not going to change over with the podcast,
I would normally go to the podcast email, but instead I'll give out my email and lambravia.
It's a K McPhail.
That's all one word.
That's K-M-A-C-P-H-A-I-L at Yahoo.com.
So K McPhail at Yahoo.com, if you have any questions, so please feel free.
Like I said, if you're going to come along, but I didn't would love to see you.
If you come along late, then just check, search on Twitter or get new social,
search the hashtag pod call Glasgow.
And we'll keep you up to date as to where we're moving to.
Well, no, we would be great to actually beat the record of distance traveled
because two years ago, in the very first one, we were joined by somebody from Mexico.
I think it was.
Was he Mexican or US?
He was Marxist vegan on all the identical.
I think he's on good news social as well, though.
Right.
I remember you telling me about this.
I don't remember where I came from.
So I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
It's I think it was he was either it was either he was either American and lived in Mexico,
or he was maybe Mexican and American.
I can't remember which way around it was, but yeah, that's terrible.
I think I comes all the way across and all the way up to Glasgow and can't even remember the exact
but I do remember he's he's at Marxist vegan.
And he wasn't identical.
I'm pretty sure he's now on good news social.
Hello.
Okay.
Hope he can make it again.
Oh, yes, indeed, but like I said, everybody's welcome.
So please, like I said, even if it's just coming along for if you live in Glasgow or live near
Glasgow, you just want to come along for maybe a couple of times more than welcome.
If you think, yeah, sounds good.
Let's go for the whole night.
Yep.
We will shall do that too.
You have been like I said, more than welcome.
Very cool.
Please do come along.
Like I said, it'll be good night.
It's for anybody who's going to invest in whether it's techy, whether it's an interest
you've got anything you think could be for podcasting or maybe you just like to listen to
podcasts.
Maybe you've been involved in them.
Just think starting up your own.
Then you've been more than welcome.
So on that note, I think we shall play it for that tune.
What do you reckon?
Yes, yes.
We look forward to seeing everybody and let's go out and style.
Yes, indeed.
So this is dark man's sounds and the track is be out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
