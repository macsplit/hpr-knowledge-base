MUSIC
Good evening, I'm Trick Anubis and I finally broke down and bought a new microphone.
But doesn't sound so much smoother though, especially on the low frequencies, I noticed
that it captures like the bassy part of my voice a lot better, and that's nice I think.
If you're in the market for a microphone, I'm going to have to recommend this Sure 8900,
that's right, it's just bought, then we just take a moment and tell you about it in case
you need a microphone.
It's fantastic, 40 bucks after shipping from Amazon or whatever, and it comes in a kit
right so you have everything you need to make excellent podcasts, you got your microphone,
you're fitting screw, you actually don't even use that, it comes with this nice little
carrying case, you get the actual microphone itself, of course, the mount, the XLR cable
with the low adapter so you can plug it into a bigger jacket if you need to, you know,
a 1.4 step 1.8, and it's adorable though desktop tripod, so if you need a microphone,
Sure 8900, it sounds great as you can tell, but moving on, there are a lot of people listening,
I've been told the user base, the listener base rather, is about 5,000, I don't know if I believe
it, I'm looking at some of the stats right now, there's nothing that suggests it's as high as 5,000,
but I do believe that it's one or two to 3,000 at least, oh by the way, there are two people
who have, who browse the site, one person uses a palm, it looks like, and one person uses a
PlayStation 3, either one of you people send me an email, because I just want to know what you're
doing on the site that you had to go there with a palm, or PS3, and there's actually, I thought
I saw someone who was using an iPod with, okay, not an iPhone, but an actual iPod with Wi-Fi,
so if you're either of those three people, just suit me an email, just for the hell of it,
because I just want to say aye, anyway, the point being there are so many of you out there,
and I'm really interested in what you have to say, so here's what I want you to do,
I want you personally to come on the show with me, okay, I want you to teach me something
that I don't know, maybe you're really into space, you know, you love rockets and the
Mars rover and stuff like that, that's not my field, come tell me about it, we're doing
any of you kind of thing, you know, and you can just spend as much time as you want,
telling me all about it, I'll take care of all the editing, and I'll make your crappy microphones
sound great, so you don't have really an excuse, you know, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be fun,
you're gonna have a lot of fun, and the idea being that once we get past this first step,
you know, maybe if you actually did have fun, you'll make some shows in your own, okay,
and we'll increase the audience base, so what I'm saying, but we'll go ahead and we'll do one
together, and we'll stop, you know, we'll get rid of all your hesitations about it, right,
I'll show you all the things that I'm gonna do, I'll show you how I edit the show,
so if you want to know how to edit it, you can use free software, you don't have to go out
and buy Adobe Audition or anything, you can use like a, you know, audacity or whatever,
you can make a bad microphone sound pretty good, there's a lot of things you can do,
so here's what you should do, if you're interested and you should be because you're probably a very
smart person if you managed to find this site, and you probably have something very good to say,
go ahead and send me an email, drake anubisatgmail.com, and just introduce yourself, tell me what you
want to talk about, right, go ahead and you know, we're kind of shoot back and forth a little bit,
you can, you know, drafts from a shout-outs if you want, if you just want to, you know,
ball, you know, ball part of it, but uh, wing it, you know, and that's fine to you, whatever you
want to do, it's all about you here, and you know, we'll make some kind of connections, Skype,
phone, you know, I have a phone, it works fantastically, whatever works for you, and you know,
it's like an interview, you just talk about whatever just, you know, floats your belt, whatever just,
you know, tickles your fancy, right, all right, sounds terrific, and you with the, uh, trio,
the iPod and the PlayStation, seven email just anyway, because I just want to say hi, great,
we're gonna get a bunch of shows going with a lot of people, we're gonna start expanding the,
you know, the corresponding bass, gonna have a lot of new fresh stuff, it's gonna be a lot of fun,
I'm really looking forward to it, so let's go ahead and get that ball thrown on that,
and uh, let's see intro, outro music, rather than the boring typical music, let's play something,
uh, God, this is the 4th of July, what do you play for the 4th of July? I don't, I don't have any
country music per se, but, uh, you know what, uh, Seek Pod has never done before,
although that's a Seek Pod, I met 12 of the German music,
oh god, it's only patriotic, uh, no, red, white, and blue,
well, I got very white and blue by Toby Keats, remember that is, okay, happy 4th of July,
god, man, we lit up your world, like the 4th of July, hey uncle, say I'm put your name,
has a top of his list, and a statue, every district started shaking her fears,
and the eagle will fly, and it's gonna be here, when you him of a freedom starter,
ring it or fail, and it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you,
oh, brought to you courtesy, oh, the red, white, and blue,
you
