This is Hacker Public Radio episode 3546 for Monday the 7th of March 2022.
Today's show is entitled HBR Community News for February 2022 and is part of the series
HBR Community News. It is hosted by HBR volunteers and is about 61 minutes long and carries an
explicit flag. The summary is made. Ronan can talk about shows released and comment
posted in February 2022.
Hi everybody my name is Ken Fallon. You listen to another episode of Hacker Public Radio
today. I mean as you use for February 2022. Joining me this evening is live from Scotland.
Aha! Now I know who you're referring to. It's me, it's Dave Morris.
You read today if I was being on a professional level for a second.
I'd also join me for the other side of the pod is it's Rowan in Baltimore.
Oh god. You know if this is a professional show I'd be pressing stuff.
Going back in there doesn't mean it's a lot of fun. We probably get a card to the end of it.
Don't bother next time. Just stick with the script Dave that's all you have to do.
All right HBR as you can tell is a community podcast that releases shows every weekday,
Monday through Friday. On any topic that's of interest hackers HBR Community News which is this
episode within the podcast is where regular contributors just like you come along and give
some feedback on the previous shows and discuss all the comings and goings and stuff that's
been happening in the background that you might not be aware of because after all HBR's community
project. So Dave as a traditional you will introduce the new hosts. Yes and we really do have a new
host this time and whose name I believe is tack of 751. So there we go welcome on board.
So first things first let's go through all the shows from last month and the first one was HBR
3522 and it was setting up robots building lab and builds for $0 robot platform and just by
making good Toronto. Yes it's very cool. Basically took the guts of
privileges and stuff and got quite a lot of harvested for parts which I would always recommend you do.
Yeah I've seen other people on YouTube doing this. You can get some excellent pulleys and bearings
and just nice straight steel I assume rods and stuff if you want to make devices of any sort.
Yes and stay tuned this won't be the last we'll see of that I can assure you.
How so I've found it interesting I think it was this one I know you've got a couple as you
handed but the treats app for you're getting your flux to flow I think was one of the
heads on that one I was like oh that's pretty cool. I'm glad you mentioned that that's actually
quite good isn't it yeah yeah yeah I'm not quite sure what that was was that like pine resin or
something yeah yeah yeah so it's the thing you you use on your bow if you're if you're a
you're a bonus or a gender yeah that's one that's one yep so no comments on that as yet but the
following day DNT do not translate or I need for power as I say in Dutch the compose key for
exgenome and windows and this this I use quite a lot actually I didn't use it quite a lot but
then I suddenly started using it quite a lot don't know if you set that up folks so this one
is is bootmarked now on my computer I can assure you yeah I did this a year or so back and running
KDE I've got it as one of the auto starty things when KDE starts up so yeah I just I don't know
how I lived without it I haven't had a chance to do this yet but it was very interesting I didn't
really thought about the compose key so I think I definitely want to try try some of these things out
so I'll do the first comment and it was by Linux Mint F XFCE thank you very much I've
been working on learning languages with dual lingo but the special characters I've ignored
because I could not enter them easily my notes with them were correct because I could easily map
keys but I had no idea how to do it in Linux in general without entering a bunch of keys that
sometimes conflict with the app so all I had to do was settings keyboards select layout tab
slide off use system defaults on the compose keys select write alt close everything
under settings and then step 2 bi are basically edit file in your home directory does capital X
capital C or MP or C X compose a file that they did not have by the way and then modify it as
shown in the link to the most excellent wiki on the internet well second perhaps arch Linux wiki
on how to configure compose keys then save reboot and you're done and to do might be to add
special keys for repetitive tasks so I would say that's a thumbs up how would you say
I yeah I think I would agree with that it's damn good I would say that's handy because you can
actually add your own shortcuts in there which is super yeah there's not a thing I've done so
that yeah that's a good thing to go and investigate so part do of the apocalyptic robot build
easy for me to say wheel addendum how to reliably attach wheels to a PAR robot platform
and this again was by mechatronic and jd weld was used to give you a spoiler lots of cool
images and show notes and if you have not seen this this hack of a more control car you really need
to go have a look at the picture 11 is a classic of yes yes thing of beauty absolutely yes it
strikes me as something we would use as a movie prop in a like a in a psycho horror film and you know
the the Bruce Melissa's hide me and the coach would have gone and then all of a sudden this thing
kind of comes in beside him to to the couch exploding etc
absolutely definitely captures that host apocalyptic theme that's the idea that is the idea
yes but then this part for confusing proof confusing plurals where Dave tries to teach us
grammar he does so it says and let me see how about Rome can you do zoka sure english
multiple words multiple words in a row i was talking about the horses and cart sign and the guy
that made it left too much space between horse and and and and and cart and they completely
contrived one about had where someone doing a test used had someone else had had however
the examiner preferred had had Smith where Jones had had had had had had had had had had had had had had
the examiner's approval yes yes yes yes okay now do mine where Jones had had was my title hi
thanks for the comment the had had things were a favorite of my late father so they were instilled
into my brain for an early age it's great to be reminded of the thanks smiley face
a DNC said processes now i think we're seeing some people take purls like crises like cries
a crisis crisis okay i'll obviously edit this out not let me have DNT with processes now i think
we're seeing some people take the purls like crisis into any pure word that ends with ease so we're
hearing people say processes cities start talking about processes and i stop listening
do people do that really you better believe it absolutely wow okay fine whatever processes disease
okay and uh wait why not said thanks i learned something new here and we'll listen to other
episodes in the series too and that why not has been spelled w-y in a ut yes we we approve of that
yes indeed so are we trying to do that said i said to DNT reprocesses processes i'm also
reluctant to people finding about with these apparently random singulas and gloros
after all there are some amazingly good resources on the internet that explain unusual words and
where they came from however i suppose you need some sort of incentive to look
i do my other one hope you find the episodes useful why not why not um i think if the english
pronunciation doesn't quite work but never mind or mind doesn't anyway hi thanks for the comment
i hope you find the whole set of episodes useful i said excellent apparently english gets more
comments than textures there you go that's why that's why i think you're with them so there's
obviously people who have the same brain problems i do look at these things go oh no they've
spelled it wrong somebody's wrong on the internet and yeah yeah this is why when people say to the
yeah yeah should have recorded sure but i defaults that yes because you have no idea what people
are going to find interesting you know not saying it was not interesting day by only means but
all right yeah i get the message clear yeah yeah yeah anyway uh community news was the next day and we
have one comment by tray and the government was uh i was sad that there was no comments on the
December community episodes so i had to leave a comment on this one you all do an amazing job
ensuring that every pocket uh for the month receives discussion as in a frequent date for your
country we sure i enjoy comments on my podcast and hear your thoughts surely others feel the same
keep up the good work thank you very much for your comments obviously good thing to uh
supply comments to shores if you can yeah yeah yeah people are waiting for the
sometimes yeah it really does it's good to know that there really is somebody listening out there
so the next day we had my geeky experiment park three where Claudio talks about
upgrading is it is this e pc 901 netbook to updating the ssg and that's and i am very jealous
of his netbook because it's hard to find that form factor you can get the chrome book form factor
but you can't find a netbook form factor with like proper keys and the proper places and stuff
yeah it's it's a nice little machine i've got the the next one up is it the
one thousand and one i can't remember what the zero number is but uh it um yeah it's it's not in
use now but i see is it when i had a small consultancy business that was the thing i took to
to meetings and and visits to clients and stuff great little thing so there are two comments on
that do you guys want to take them for own perhaps first sure uh we have comment one from
when to go uh patta and netbooks my dome mini nine has the same patta interface so it seems like
it was all the rage during the netbook days between that and thirty two bit atom processors
i'm afraid mine is reaching the limit of its usefulness mines regulated to console and frame
buffer apps kudos on getting yours running chromium
klaudio m says re patta and netbooks i hear on extending the lives of these devices nowadays but with
open bsd and fluxbox along with the ssd and adapter it's surprisingly useful
firefox won't build on open bsd stroke xh6 it's synced fault since it needs more memory so it won't
be including id any longer c-monkey is still available but not sure for how much longer
interesting interesting and slackware on a netbook in response to hpr3512
this is art or 72's updates on the build and includes links to several different
plans which are all worth knowing in their own right sensors was a new one to me
yeah i actually use i was like oh i like that sensors command because my my laptop when i'm running
of vm and a couple things going it's been really the fans been kicking up high and occasionally it'll
just like it'll just stop like it crashed like it just shuts down and so i'm i started monitoring
it just to see if it was like a a heating issue using uh the sensors command
it's just surprisingly obvious command that amazes i never typed it before yeah sensors oh yeah
all that information hi yeah i didn't know about that either and you had to do it on a raspberry
pie but on a big big boy machine yeah this pretty nice little command you can even get it
set up to like run like every so many seconds and show you the differences on the uh like what
what changed between the last reading and everything it's pretty cool yeah yeah i've just started
using a conkey just going back to conkey just for the amusement of it and maybe you can configure
in there somewhere hmm cool i'm not uh ignore lead switch things i'm not saying about archers episodes
that tend to be short but they are like you know very distilled down to oh right do you know
that sort of stuff it's it's like the short story of your uh podcast you cut out everything but
the yeses what's up the the yellow cheat notes that people used to get before exams those books
cliff notes that's it but if not it's on exactly fantastic okay next day we
but then it's in laws the two-year plan of the five-year plan problem
sameness shimmies sub promotion of redis presentation at the 2021 mini depth comp
and grumpy olical who are a podcast actually is quite funny guys uh a lot of
playful banter going on between the two yes the yeah the known interview shows are very very
high in banter yes yes so there's no comments on that nor on the next one which was phonemes
and ascii which is uh amazing stuff about the uh basically the old filenames where they come from
asterisk star asterisk etc etc i know you don't like extensions dude but i do
well they they're okay you have their place yes i occasionally used them and then i'm amazed
that the vim says there's an extension on this file i will fire up all the things to do with
bash there you go and i go oh didn't realize it did that it's quite handy didn't it yeah yeah but it's
like it's like having me having to label my my shoes or something it's shoe can you tell what they
are from what they do no no you can't it's like it's like you not putting your labels saying diesel
on the petrol car yeah that's two cars they both take fuel and you have no clue but just by looking
as hot type of fuel they are whether it's electric whether it's diesel or whether it's petrol
you might be able to deduce it early quickly but to just sniff it out the rental process indeed
no i do i do take your point but i came from an operating system i worked with the MS as i said
before about ten years and every file has its own type so you know you you don't need to say
this is a blah blah file because the file itself tells you when i discovered Unix in the 80s or
whenever it was i was amazed how they'd done something very similar with all this magic number
businesses in in files you know there are things that look and say oh look it's got a start
bash thingy you know a hash bang thing so that'll be a bash file then i'll treat it like a bash
etc etc all loose things were done so so i at the start felt it wasn't it was only stupid windows
that you need to tell it what it was otherwise it had a huge sulk that you know it was i've always
wanted to go with that because it seemed like sensible way to handle it so this is the one thing
from my old Mac HFS days with the resource fork because i always liked one that you didn't have
to use extensions but two you could like i mean grand yet use utility but you could
modify a specific file and to tell it which program to open with so like not all your jpegs had
to open with whatever the default was or you didn't have to to pick you could say okay right now
i'm editing them so i could change it to you know gimp or you know at the time whatever the app was
edited but others would open up in the preview automatically okay that's a short bite
oh sorry that's very cool i like that it's cool i had no idea but yeah you need to do a shawl
and that now sorry about that okay i will do that the subject of how operating systems work out
what the hell the file is they're dealing with is quite an interesting one in in general i think so
yes it's a bit scope bit scope there i think possible series gets a cloudy one for
to do the bsds and we'll see how far we go next day we had barrier software kvm and as
as says as yeah sorry as windy go says yeah this is the sort of software that if you need this
you'll love it if you don't need it you kind of go why did i ever want to have this
and i followed into the first category it's absolutely brilliant if you if you know it exists
and you have that particular use case which is multiple computers and you want to use the same
keyboard or mouse on them yeah yeah it's it's cool stuff we um are we tended to when i was working
people tended to have multiple computers in their office and they would have one keyboard one mouse
and then a mechanical kvm between them i still got one in the house somewhere you with the with
buttons on it and stuff that you huge as well yeah yeah are the cables massive yeah
and i must dig that out sometime just to show the kids look at this what do you think this is
and they say it's rubbish dad throw it away but um that's the usual kind of
usual way the conversation goes oh god i just told you i just come back from my fifth visit
tireless and some of that passed away and now we're going through the stuff and this is exactly
to the i think i probably should probably the time to shut up probably it was it was it was most it
was in it was very interesting and there are software kvms there's also raspberry pi kvm i've seen
people talking about so that's that's quite a cool thing as well if you've got multiple raspberry
pies and you set up a bunch of keyboard for the lot of them and then you're using them you know
in your 19-inch rack or whatever that's so that's very very good uh very impressive who turns it to
do conventional idea this one from tray or who's who wants to do uh i'll do tray old school kvms
thank you for sharing i remember being uh i remember taking apart an old mechanical kvm to
train the contacts from more reliable operation i still have electronic kvms floating around but
happened had the need uh in quite some time i definitely need to look uh to use the barrier
keep up the great work yeah good point it's good to know about definitely i had to set up a
work where i used uh uh raspberry pi is the second monitor as a second device without a keyboard
and mouse on it in fact usb was completely disabled on and you could ssh into it and then
pipe um barrier it's equivalent to control if you're a keyboard uh kvia which is extremely
specific i think i even may have to not show enough at one state good good very useful yes
next day we had self-holosting in a small scale episode zero the stammer and the general idea
this is what one uh uh takov 751 our new host came onto the hpur matrix channel and was discussing
this idea uh to which uh i suggested that they were in corbis show and they did see how easy it can be
so i'd like to see uh yeah this idea of run and ducker images i was never a huge big fan of it until
quite recently uh specifically uh when uh tattoo did he show about quickly starting up a ducker
image that downloads it at your own bash and then that's just over that just to me made it uh
made it one step more functionality than you know having a flat pack i'm kind of using some flat
packs now and that makes ducker containers into the same ease of use sort of level so yeah
i'm really looking forward to this sort of thing why i uh suffer when you can make tea
the easy way with the new tea express
indeed indeed maybe i like the misery i'm making tea
i quite like the comment about um home the home automation and home assistant stuff
yes yes and uh i'm seriously looking at setting that up uh at some point um and using
using uh uh docker to do it is is often recommended as a way of uh
getting better functionality correct correct and unfortunately there were no comments on that but
don't let that disturb you and the next day we had a show about porridge literally
about porridge took a tour of to a said interesting porridge is one of those things that many people
probably find very mundane but when you start digging into details you discover a lot of interesting
tidbits like what kind of grains are for animals or what which are for human uh
berries from culture to culture and from period to one period to another and then tray said
steel cut oats thank you for sharing i absolutely love steel cut oats much better than
rolled in my humble opinion looking forward to your next podcast topic so i uh commented on this
one great great show topic excellent show i was listening to this while making porridge for my
breakfast i have some steel cut oats i live in scotland after all but i tend to prefer rolled oats
probably because it's what i was brought up on in england mind you in scotland steel cut oats
are called pinhead oatmeal my porridge gets salt and a teaspoon of honey and diabetics i avoid sugars
but only recently found that honey has a low glycemic index about 50 you're probably so it's
not going to give me a sugar high like sugar wood at least not a teaspoon of it
used to visit the far east each year many years ago and i became quite keen on rice porridge
which is called congee it's very bland but it's eaten with lots of added stuff like pickles and
roast peanuts it was pretty good for breakfast great show i enjoyed the ambience and i
spoke to a lot yep there you go porridge and show us about english this is what our tech podcast
network has to send the two folks so if you're a real hardcore tech now you need to send in
shows on that of course if you got more shows of porridge and more shows of different things about
languages please send them it was off i don't care i keep the shows going tech easy beat porridge i'm
sure yeah and they also speak in the in their languages so there you go some dude indeed
and the following day we had a show about forna vernier calipers which i submitted
and arne b wrote at 66 years old i bought one about four years ago and i'm surprised how much
i used it here is a nice youtube video that shows how to how an even cheap ebay version
works great and the link is included there which is at bigclive.com one which is one that kind
of prompted me to record this episode in the first place along with the fact that one of the guys
and work saw it behind me in a conference call very cool i didn't look at the video yet i should
check it out i have one of the the later ones with a little electronic display thingy on it and
not sure how accurate that is i actually prefer yours but it's it's amazingly useful thing gets
gets a fair bit of use in this house i have two two electronic ones was the eat batteries so i
take the batteries out of them and then by the time i want to put the batteries in and you're
fathom above it then i just i'm able to resolve the mechanical one a lot easier so it's there all
the time yeah i was surprised how quickly the these little tiny settles get eaten up by this thing
just sitting there apparently switched off but not i think the bigclive video the the recent generation
of the ones that really plastic ones are have excellent battery life i recall him saying
boss you should have one in your toolbox don't really definitely a good thing to have yes
it's definitely reminded me i need to i'm pretty sure i have one somewhere i haven't used to
meet it in probably some university but i that's i don't know why it is very handy i think they
were so expensive i always thought the fault of them as a precision tool you know like yeah
um yeah like a regular color preset and then you go to the store room and then you have to
you know leave in the deposit to get it back or at least we did so uh then yeah you but now
they're so cheap why wouldn't you have one in the room okay right and yeah took a tour took a
tour of talks how she's using template hascal to cut down the amount of code she writes
template has hascal of course this made sense when i was listening to it now i'm looking at the show
notes going along that all seems to have flown up my brain again yes yes i i wrote myself a note about
this one i don't really tell you what my notes are but i wrote down this is a tour de force which left
me gasping because there's so much intense stuff in there i get the principle but the world of
hascal is so alien there's just i just came out of that feeling i got it it was amazing
while i was there but yeah same as you i don't think i've brought much away with it other than
astonishment yeah that's some pretty much right there with you the few times i've even like
tried to learn to program with in Haskell i'll start sort of rocking a little bit and then you
listen to an episode like this and you like said you can kind of follow it but i'm like i
have no idea what's going on yes i i'm surprised though that the Haskell
hawks are not like circling hpr for this stuff i really you know there will come a day when
somebody discovers hey there seems to be a whole series of stuff over here on Haskell and how i
do all this sort of interesting things so yes so you matter time folks and if you're one of those
people please drop a comment in the comment section because i know Tukadorito has been chugging
away there for years and could do with some positive feedback please now next day laptop power
problems Andrew McNally as we know him had a problem with his laptop or supply and was messing
with it actually i remember this uh yes it was halaris halaris in that first i did this then
that didn't work then i did this and then i fixed it with this this this is true hacking
though isn't it really just yeah it's some actually active sense now yeah yeah yeah
i don't need that so i never used that sort of thing anyway
to say it was fixed would not be accurate in this case it was a solution was achieved
yes yes which which you could argue is a fix of yes yeah but yeah who's up for doing the comment
i can take it so zen floater 2 so his title was i have a the google geopro chromebook
ago i guess uh had the same problems i assume it was a Russian attack at first it all happened
after one of google's updates i then just unplugged the chromebook and powered it off then i started
the chromebook up again and plugged it into a power source and the entire thing was resolved
i also noticed that slack worth 15 had locked up twice on me after my first boot on different
laptop and the same kind of thing had to be done over there too i have touched with my dell
that if i have the power supply connected then i i only think connected then and i need to unplug it
i think it could be that intel you know they're running a separate operating
minix operating system or something on there that might be kittens uh that uh what is that
caught right i know what you're talking about yeah anyway yeah it sounds yeah sometimes i can't get
my machine to boot so i have to unplug everything turn it off and then i can start it up again
now brine and ohio had getting to blinky with flash forth come forth and flash
though that sounds a lot pervier than i mentioned to be but anyway this uh this was
putting forth on a uh Arduino which in principle i applaud but that's a lot of work
it's it's the the travels that are the fun part yeah i knew if you were a fourth programmer
i i guess it's cool no it's cool it's definitely good we love it we love the chill it's brilliant brine
keep them calm but i but i have hard enough doing point and clicking to my Arduino slot and
flash booting them and stuff yeah pretty impressive i thought it was good to see
um an actual usage um uh the installation of fourth and and it being used to to do things on
the on the Arduino even if it's just switching LEDs on and off so it's a really valid thing to do
and it's uh yeah it's very very cool i think it briefly with fourth but never did anything useful
with it um a long long time ago it's something you really need to dedicate time to i think if you
want to want to get into it but uh yeah good to through to go to follow brine and ohio with this
real engineers language fourth is yeah definitely picks up a few kudos as uh tickets from us here
on the whole these hacker skills front oh cracky and the next day we had archer 72 installing the
tenacity audio editor something which i wanted to do myself and use the show in order to do it
in order to check and see if plug-in was working and therefore i added a comment saying how to run it
and you can run it using flatback space run space org dot tenacity audio dot tenacity
and that was my comment although i recently discovered it just as in the menu so
great yeah yeah i struggled to get it to work personally but yeah it's really useful show um there
was another comment from random linux user sure i come across that person before um
installing tenacity audio editor tenacity is an almost dead project if you take a look at
their repository closely you'll see that all this happening is rebranding very little has happened
there in the past few months audacity has been a work of two guys for the Kameli James Krut
and without them i don't see anyone is capable of adding new features and improvements to it
after all it has been their brainchild their labor of love telemetry is everywhere from kde to
Firefox unless and until it's stealthy and doesn't give you options to opt out it's not that bad
and the last sentence was um why the tenacity for uh for it i think a lot of there was some telemetry
added i don't think it necessarily was the update there was the way it was handled
that people have the issue with yeah yeah yeah it was i'm sure the people who objected had looked
carefully to see if it was just something like a turn off or i'm sure everyone who objects the
stuff on the internet does that day of yes good yeah it's amazingly sensible and uh it's
being English probably and everything okay uh the next day we had Doug de Milo and Alex brown
from the open suzer project i was so annoyed with this show and i'll tell you why
because i was suddenly covered at the time and because i found the show so interesting i put
the two-inch dials in where the one-inch dials should have gone and now i've got four additional
holes on the side of my brand new cover oh no but it was a good show don't do that
if you ever run open suzer i have and what drove me lots about it was the fact that
the configuration overrides your configuration files but that was years ago i think a bit of change
since then i've quite tempted to try i've there was a department in the university i worked out
that absolutely swore by open suzer they had it on everything um but we never used it where we
ended up running red hats enterprise stuff uh on all our our service so it's fancy to just
play around with it a bit quite tempting to do so after listening to this yeah that's the same
the same here i've been uh um like pretty much just devian and then ubuntu based but i've been reading about
yes suzer for years and i don't know why i've never tried it i mean since it's always you know
some version of the style i've been out there but i don't know i mean it's a free
liberal source operation system absolutely no reason why somebody couldn't just boot up a spare laptop
and try it out yeah yeah be a good good thing to try and make a show off yes in actual fact very good
thank you very much that's why i'm paying you big bucks to be on the show keep plugging
to send in the show things hsd component layer modes and for some reason i'm thinking up
heavy goods vehicles there but it's about layer modes in the gimp and again you should go to
uh hukas WordPress to get more information on that no comments also another series that i think
could do with people commenting on yeah although the hukas are always so thorough that sometimes
it's like okay that's great i don't know if i have anything to comment on other than that's great
yeah oh yeah perfect yes yes yes i think that might be nice okay i yeah yeah i think actually that should be
it just i liked the show thank you
okay anyway the next day was one of spoons uh with the case of missing ideas and he poned our
he poned our intro david did you hear that
very clever very clever and an interesting show nonetheless you want to do uh
few blisters there's us there's comment i think it's probably my turn isn't it is because i am not
going to do a language show thank you very much okay uh publius i would imagine says have
constructions and most speakers of western european languages with a more eG German or less eG
english inflected latin serves as the paradigm for inflected languages because it's not anything like
as commonly taught in schools anymore but it's still there in the background serving as the
model against which the grammar of the vernacular has traditionally been constructed
the slav slavonic languages such as russian the paradigm is classical greek in latin there's of course
verb habere meaning to have as well as tenere to hold but it's common to use the
copula or being verb with the dative in other words i have it or it belongs to me is often expressed
as it me est quasi literally translated into english as it to me is interestingly i've read that
in many languages whatever have constructions exist tend to be taken over by the verb meaning
hold or grasp and obvious example is the way that in spanish for example the verb derived from
tenere is used to mean hold while the latin habere has essentially vanished english cognates
such as tenure tenacity and so on also show a movement from the concrete to the abstract
wow cool stuff yes is that not a series somebody does bursting at the seams to do a series on
language sounds like it yeah yeah i think there this person's grasp of these things is
very much greater than mine anyway i did do latin at school i tested it so much that
very very little stuck i had the last year of latin i had i was the first year not to have to do
latin at my school it's good it's amazing how many times i've regressed at that
it it well having gone on to do biology then of course latin is falling on your head all the time
because everything so many words that you use are latin origin but uh i went off the naming
of naming of animals and plants and stuff is all done using latin terms so you sort of pee out
that way but i prefer doing that than sitting through lessons of it how to conjugate verbs and stuff
yeah uh reminded of the one to fight the life of brown what it gets called during the graffiti
where they latin teacher yes yeah yeah oh how do you uh yes other things that i wasn't allowed to do
nissing and that what i have regressed at multiple times yes yes it's so it said that these
boundaries that existed in the past are very strange yes there was um there was a fraction in my
school because i was in the i stayed until the sixth form to it in a bit called the remove
just never very strange english way of handling um parts of parts of learning
we were allowed to to volunteer to go into other other language other other lessons so there was
a bunch of us who um elbowed into the the cooking stuff which was not allowed for boys normally
and uh but we did and we we don't have to make all manner good stuff i'm sure that that helped a
lot us just i mean make so no no sense at all that boys shouldn't be allowed to cook but then
go to another two would work or mentor work which we have extra maths classes
so yeah good stuff yes the worst car i ever had Dave
visa released a 30-year-old frustration about particularly dreadful caring one sort
that said though you can tell listening to him that he was loving it that there was love
there with that car at the same time i was thinking i had a car once that i had the same amount of
trouble with but i loved it it was my first car and it was the only thing i could afford and
like the brew man will think i must have replaced every component of the twice you know
all right we we have strayed straight into March i should point out oh oh dear well just don't worry
Dave i'll edit that out don't you worry we think we have more to do let me just have more to
say stop here so we know there it is there's the embassy mark oh probably yep yep
let's just go out to you of next month so yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll have more to say we'll have more to
say we'll have more to say next one i i was really tempted to write a comment to this one because
or possibly do uh my worst car it's oh of course i can take several that i would really like to
to at least stay still for five minutes so that's a great idea for sure brilliant idea for sure
and so so it is so we'll have a bit more to say about it next time round yes we shall
we might even have our own shows in the queue before then
so nothing else interesting happened in the month Dave
were there any other comments on older shows yes there were
uh Ken Fallon commented on automatically spit albums into audacity tracks by Ken Fallon
saying i'm a bit surprised to find it was myself that did the show is here for my archive memory
module yes yes the answer is yes um let me yeah we had a comment on
glad to show about Yamal basics from windigo who says exactly what i needed this episode was the
explanation of Yamal that i needed i know it's been used since it aired but i used the fundamentals
explained here every single time i opened a Yamal file yes i can't believe that was 2020 he
recorded that i actually need to go back and read that because like yeah planning into Yamal
files at work and it's driving me nuts no go have a go have a listen to that it's well worth it
why guard how to uh by tintimity ken fallon said thanks again just use this again and
tintimony on the replies i think me too glad at least two of us find it useful just setting up a new
to me gen 2 think pad x1 yoga and needed to remind myself how to create client keys
so there you go load it to your yeah um next cloud the hard way by ken fallon a comment
uh by ken fallon wrist and chills each of these could have been its own show
okay i am going insane now but in that episode it was broken down into uh lots of different
chapters there has been five four how to set up next cloud the stalling php during the update
how to set up let's encrypt and it was all how to set up a patchy it was all dumped into one show
so i shouldn't split it up this uh there's a ken fallon reply to a ken fallon show next
i wonder who's going to do that this is uh teresiact
teresiact test are right does that mean something
it's a geometrical figure i think it's where it's a yeah like like a hexagon or something like that
that's hilarious yeah optical character recognition i can never remember the name so yet another one
i was the common loading memory from myself to myself i should i do the next one
jesras show consuming an a q i a p i um we've got thank you from stash a f your podcast gave me
the idea to do the same for my states daily covid updates i was able to find the a p i info
break it out so i could extract my states and counties and zip codes respective numbers
don't have to click through several interactive maps awesome yeah that's pretty that's pretty
neat i'll show i take the next one thank you yep uh so this is uh tepisode uh three five
oh four james web space telescope by Dave Morris it's from clacky how l2 work i attempted an
explanation of how l2 orbit works over at it's on lebronette.de but i'll repeat in brief
you can orbit l2 because earth pulls you the y component of the pool keeps you in orbit around
l2 and the x component cancels out with your centrifugal force from orbiting the sun too fast
there's a proper and deeper explanation launch pat astronomy how james web orbits nothing
how in how james web orbits nothing and then there's two links one on far side linked
individuals watch uh and then a youtube and i'm guessing it looks like it goes to the same place
okay so um clacky comment three on the show says re centrifugal force as to whether centrifugal
force is real or not i will forever refer to and he gives an h kcd reference and says forces
aren't real anyway so yeah well yes it's uh i was hoping and we would comment on this
because he's the real astronomer and i'm just uh just uh this might be the logic but uh yeah
we'll see thank you clacky for those interesting comments yes although clacky he could have been
a show in verse i think we all agree do we all agree he knows he knows i'm sure he knows yes
last month we had a call for shows because there was very little shows in the cube and i got
worried if i got worried yeah so essentially people i need to remind you again yeah if you
met it this far and you still listening then you need to send it to show as there's only so much
suffering you can take and then you can submit to show a next month you can suffer through next
month's episode and hear what we have to say about your show what could be you know this cool
paper playful banter that we do here could be about your show so that's a that's an offer too good
to refuse Dave it's so good i'm waiting to listen for my feedback for next month there you go
yep very good so we do have still quite a lot of slots for before next community news that Dave
and at this point if you could like we have a free slot within the 14 day danger period
and then after that there's only one or two shows posted on this quite a few weeks with nothing at all
so this is this this could be rectified are you doing a series if you've never submitted a show
obviously just introduce yourself thus kind of the neighborly thing to do and yeah send in shows
because it's not like every other podcast that's got regular holes and they're doing it for
whatever the laws this is community sharing uh sharing knowledge sharing stories sharing language tips
or whatever else hackers find interesting there's only so many ways i can say that people
send in your shows that then i won't have to but Ken is persistent and will keep saying it until
there's enough please shut me up by sending in shows so Dave what else was there so under the
any other business heading i hope you're able to say that all of the shows in the the range 1 to
870 it all been uploaded uploaded 120 but there's there's actually three not four that didn't get
uploaded and that's because there seem to be some shows already in the system with the numbers
with the identities uh hbr 0001 and two so i yeah i can see who you can't view them they're just
there and in the way i've tried to contact um was it who was i contacting i've forgotten
uh tech mr text files yeah i can't remember i know his last name is scott but i've forgotten his
first name uh is it jason scott i can't remember yes yes yes yes but uh saying because his name is
attached to them when you you become a are you log in as a as an editor um and you can see that
eight point four years ago he's created so i'd like to know if the that's that's something that
needs to remain or whether i can have the those particular ideas but maybe not so so we're nearly
anyway the whole point i'm waffling um the point of this is that we're uh 99.9% finished with
uploading old shows and uh except these these last two or three haven't been uploaded properly
okay okay but yes excellent work dude sorry uh there were some other stuff that i wanted to
mention i have it here in my text file uh one is we have moved the outcast planters is now on the
bearer so everybody should be aware of that uh the google plus is still in the photo for some reason
and i have a tank marked in here to remove that uh we updated it by a range permission on the website
and uh tattoo i was balacanum for the fact that he sent in an intro then he pointed out that
well the website says to send in an intro so i have updated the website so that there's no
you don't send in through an outro anymore and that's done um you've also done the HTTPS
stuff dude oh yeah i completely forgot about that yeah yeah i wrote a script to walk through all the
shows and find instances of HTTP and change them to HTTPS a little bit of a brutal algorithm but uh
hopefully it won't of course any any issues mostly fixed issues yeah and also i went through all the
webpages you know the pages that generate those so there's the content that comes from the database
and there's the webpages that are just around us php files and those have also been updated so
if you go to which is the original um issued by Chris monochromic uh was that um why are we not
totally HTTPS and the point is realized later that's somewhat even if you do go to HTTPS
site that some of the links point back to the HTTP ones so that's all fixed and then we also
have now fixed all the HTTP ones within the within the content itself so that's kind of cool
there might be one or two left over in files if people have submitted HTML files to sit beside
there they show it yeah so i haven't gone through those yet but uh that's on it's on that to do list
yeah i don't think that's that critical so mostly if you go to the site on HTTP you'll eventually
end up on the HTTPS link uh otherwise you'll uh it's far less likely you're going to get dumped
from the HTTPS side back to HTTP but the site will continue to work on HTTP for the purposes of
the fact that it's not required it's uh our content is public so yes if you want to download it
if you want the privacy use this if you don't care then use the user without yes
yes oh and i want to say uh i've been doing um i don't know along with much longer and go to do it
i've been doing a sort of when the twitter feed and the mastodon feed hit the um hit the feeds
when show it's the feed i reply with
okay when i uh i just comment on the twitter and the mastodon stuff so if you could boost the
tweets on twitter that would also be good uh also on mastodon if you could just you know boost it
or uh post a comment you could also do comments there uh and we might pick them up as well
don't know how we would do that Dave but we should yeah sure it's possible i don't happen to know
how to do it the moment um it's also thinking of putting in a um so many days in the in the q thing
every day tell you what the just tweeting what the when i say tweeting i mean mastodoning but
tooting tooting that's what tooting the amount of um the status of the q many days to a show
and call for shows and that's what you write that that would be pretty cool i think that would be
nice that would be very a very good thing to do i think because it's easy to not to see that there's
there's a gaping hole on a clip we're going to go over very soon and uh to raise the awareness of
that through some route like that would be great i think only when those when shows are getting
lower all the time if it's too often there's a process so i call it just called habituation we
you just stop seeing it so maybe just a sort of emergency thing would be would be better
yeah or maybe like the first of the month or when you post the um the community news just post
like they'd normally post how many days until the next and then if there's if false below a certain
level it just sort of amps it up a little bit yeah might be an idea maybe once a week to blow that
out so don't forget to record your show on the Friday evening don't forget to record your shows for
this this weekend there you go wonder why some people do record the shows is there a particular
is there a good day to record your shows that people do on the weekend or during the week or
