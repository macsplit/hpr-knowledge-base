The home of the Knightwise.com cross platform podcast that makes technology work for you and not the other way around. A place to go for all geeks who slide between Mac, iOS, Android, Linux and Windows offering an essential  mix of hacks, tips, howtos and tweaks spiced up with a dash of geek culture.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat is our philosophy?\nIn our daily lives, on the internet, whether we want it or not, hundreds of new inventions, thousands of websites and millions of bits of information engulf us as the tsunami of progress sweeps along the shores of time.\nYou have the choice:  Be washed away on by the virtual surf  or turn technology into a tool that works for you.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere at Knightwise.com we think that YOU are the most important element in the technology that surrounds you. Technology should enable you and not lock you in to some vendor or product. That is why we focus on cross platform solutions that work on any operating system or mobile device you might be using, making YOU and what you want to DO the focus of our content. We dont believe in fanboys, we dont believe in vendor lock-ins and we dont believe in brands. We cater to the geeks who slide from operating system to operating system, free their data and communications and let technology work for them  instead of the other way around.\n</p>","license":"CC-BY-SA","local_image":0,"gpg":"","valid":1,"espeak_name":"knightwise"},

When he is not found endlessly walking the local streets and ravines, much of Kirbotica's time is spent trying to convince others to get involved in one of his \"great\" new ideas. On weekends, he works early in the morning at the local science centre while listening to his favorite podcasts echoing loudly through the empty halls. The voices of Hacker Public Radio, Late Night Linux, Off the Hook, Malicious Life and Darknet Diaries all keep him company as he gets the exhibits and artifacts ready for the day's visitors. A 30 year veteran in the computer industry, Kirbotica’s artistic sense has been so toned down by ex-employers, that he can only see in 2 bit color without the use of special glasses.</p>","license":"CC-BY-SA","local_image":1,"gpg":"","valid":1,"espeak_name":"Kir botica"},
