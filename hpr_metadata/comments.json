Thanks for the feedback.  I understand what you mean about fixing your pastor's Windows machine.  A few years ago I was helping out (computer-wise) at a local church.  According to Spybot S&amp;R, the secretary's PC had over 24,000 (yes, 5 digits!) hits -- malware, tracking cookies, and various heaps of digital detritus, to say nothing of every system-tray doodad under the sun.  That was well before my Linux days.\n\nBy and large, it seems that folks (pastors or otherwise) are reticent to trust techies (even well-intentioned ones) with changes that take the organization too far outside of comfortable parameters.  There's some wisdom in that.  How many times I've encountered a custom-made, one-off program (say, a database) written for a church; the creator has long since left (for whatever reason) and the organization is stuck with something they can't fix, alter, or use.  After an experience or two like that, you can guess what the response will be to \"Hey, change to Linux!\"\n\nThat said, probably the safest course of action is gradualism.  Linux may be the ultimate goal, but start off with introducing a FOSS alternative that runs in Windows.  MS Office may be another sacred cow (strange that Christians would have \"sacred cows\"!), but the hardiness of Firefox running NoScript might be the first step in the long path to the changeover.  Build on each success by introducing another FOSS alternative.  I can point to a recent success I discovered.  This summer I had the privilege of visiting a Bible college out in the \"hoots and hollers\" of Kentucky.  I was blown away by the server room that two of the graduates-now-staff had put together -- CentOS servers, FOSS phone system, Ubuntu servers.  Wireless for the whole spawling campus, too.  The college board went along with just about everything, because of the tremendous cost savings -- except the board just insisted on Windows 7 and MS Office 2007 in the student computer lab.  Still, it amounted to tremendous inroads made by some really sophisticated, heads-up techies.\n\nI'd like to communicate more at length.  Admin/Ken Fallon has the e-mail address of my alter ego.  Or you can combine what you learn in Psalm 81:16 and 147:14 and make a good Google guess about the name of our website and, from there, how to contact me directly.\n\nRegards,\n\nCurbuntu","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

For me, it's just more ergonomically comfortable.\n\nI am a Podcast and Audiobook addict. In my quest for the perfect method of getting my Podcasts onto my Clip, I have settled upon gPodder as podcatcher and a recent newcomer for MP3 tagging, PuddleTag. I've tried Kid3-Qt, but it just never took my fancy. So , I settled upon EasyTag, but that never had a good method for easily sorting files into my daily listening order. None of these Linux MP3 Taggers did. Until now. PuddleTag has been a revelation. It does everything the others do, plus allows me to rearrange my Podcast listening order, very easily any time I want. \n\nI don't always get a chance to listen to all my downloaded Podcasts throughout the day, and some days there are always a few new ones, that I'd like to listen to now and just give later track numbers to the existing ones. Reordering tracks in PuddleTag is simplicity in itself. Select the track(s) and press Ctrl-+ or Ctrl-- (You might have to go onto preferences shortcuts to get this set up, depending upon your keyboard).\n\nAnyway, something worth looking at:\n\nhttps://puddletag.sourceforge.net/\n\ngPodder's great too as I can sync gPodder between different PC's and if you have a network storage device, you can set a link on each PC to a gPodder folder on the storage device and your Podcasts won't be duplicated, but you can connect your MP3 player to any machine to get your latest podcasts.\n\nKind regards\n\nBadCam","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I am not in immediate danger of having to go camping but this is great preparedness info.  I practice my camping skills (cooking, shelter building, fire for warmth, washing clothes) in my back yard.  Wife thinks I'm crazy, but if it ever hits the fan I want to better my chances.  She lost her job so the inspiration is a little clearer in my head these days. \n\nI agree with you about how living a \"normal\" life really inflates the amount of $$$ one needs.  I have daydreams about living on much less and with much less.  One of those old Chinook microRVs would be neat.  Or an old breadtruck...\n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable begging or misrepresenting my affllliation (ie, greenpeace).  My workaround, perhaps feeble, would be to provide some service (picking up trash in that area?  playing an instrument as you describe?) and putting out a hat for that.  \n\nI will share that I really DETEST panhandling.  Around my area panhandling is an excuse to get up close and size one up for robbery.   I don't mind trashpicking, though.  I have retrieved many useful items from bins.  I always try to leave the area neater, not messed up.  \n\nI once read a tip about diving for food;  said to make sure you could tell /why/ it was thrown out:  expired, damaged, etc.  If there was no clue to why it was thrown out that experienced camper said pass it by.\n\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I like the topic-centric nature of most 'casts.\n\n===call patterns\nCalls from home/work:  I shift \"elective\" calls so I can use a landline.  Time-sensitive calls get made on the cell.  I was originally on Sprint, but was annoyed that I couldn't swap phones when I wanted (GSM FTW!) and the smallest package I could get was 300mins/month for $30.  Way, way more than I need.\n\n===Google voice\nwhat is the rationale for using a separate google account?  Not arguing, I just don't understand the benefit.\n\n===salesdroids and no data plan\nYes, salescritters will go into apoplexy if you talk about a smartphone w/out dataplan.  It's like that movie _Scanners_.\n\n\n===unlocked phones\neBay ftw!  Some of my favorite phones:\nWindoze:  unlocked HTC dash $50, BB formfactor with great kb and hardkeys.  Unlocked HTC Wizard (MDA) $50 PPC.  Unlocked HTC Typhoon?  SDA candybar, dedicated music buttons. \n\nAndroid:  an old G1 would be fine, $100.  LG Optimus-series, $150. \n\n===gps\nI wonder if we're conflating \"gps\" and \"navigation\" in this episode.  The GPS gets a lock just fine.  Would be faster with the aGPS data-enabled tower lookup, but the GPS proper will work fine with no data.  \n\nI use maydroyd offline maps (no nav) and geobeagle for waypoint navigation.  I'm looking at the Copilot site now, but haven't figured it all out yet.  I have a newer/better 'droid phone on the way, and may install copilot then.\n\n\n===Links\nhttps://www.mapdroyd.com/\nhttps://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I was inspired by your HPR to hunt one down. I found one at a yard sale for $2, but I had no cash on me and couldn't find an ATM, so that one got away. A week later I spotted one lying in the grass at the dump. It was almost perfectly camouflaged, so don't ask me how I ever saw it. Anyway, I've had it for almost a year now, and only just lit it. I was looking forward to working on the thing and tuning it up, so I was almost disappointed when it fired right up and put out perfect blue flames. I had only lit it to test it out, but my (12/yo) daughter was so excited, she ran in the house to get a pan and some eggs, which she fried up for us.\n\nOn a related topic, a good friend of mine was \"gifted\" with a half a dozen chicks late last fall (Surprise, here's chickens!). Thanks to your HPR efforts, I was able to help him build a temporary coop, and plan the larger permanent coop.

I agree that someone else tracking by log is not ideal. How many of us only log onto the \"trusted\" networks with status.net service such as the old tllts status.net cloud? The techs there are far superior to many of us normal users and there were numerous problems getting access to the service even outside of many total outages. I would certainly rather have my posts scattered across many hosts rather than something central like facebook. That does obfuscate the logs and make it harder to gather all the users data easily.  Even then, though, the isps would still have logs of the interconnected traffic. My point is this sytem would make more difficult what is very easy for google and facebook and twitter, but it still does not make coallating user usage impossible. This idea reminds me of TOR. TOR does not completely anonymize anyone, it just makes it really difficult to connect one endpoint to another for the purposes of prosecution or otherwise. A lot of people think they are fully anonymized with TOR, but I've not heard any TOR engineer claim that.\nAlso, let's say that anyone running their own social network peer wants to have advertising on their freedom box. To advertise the owner would need to share the log info with the ad company. Then we're back to spying included for free, or at least spying for free to the owner of the box. Nothing is free for the advertiser of course.  Yes it would take a while to build the database, but that just translates to more cost to the advertiser. I'm not arguing against doing this. I just want to point out that this just commutes the problem, it doesn't really solve the problem. I'll be the first to buy a freedom box, but I won't delude myself into thinking \"gee when everyone does this, we'll be truly free at last\". Look into it. It's cool. It's free software. It's fun.

Talking about modems, I remember getting into ascii codes so I could use the c=64 to access the credit bureau via dial-up like I did with the printing terminal at work. (legally of course). There was one company that made a modem that was proprietary non-standard in a patent sort of way. it was faster than most of the 300 buad modems at the time. You had to use their software or not use the modem. We figured out how the software worked and applied the changes to the modem software everyone used. The Geohotz hack of the time. Never got sued though. Their software was crappy anyway with no up to date file transfer methods. I will never mention the modem company name. I remember writing my own modem software so you could do xmodem file transfers instead of ascii dumps. Eventually wrote my own bbs software.  \n\nNo system could read another computer systems disks back then, so moving data was a pain. Not only was the disk formatting different in those days but the way data was represented in a file was also different. The letter \"a\" might be stored as a 65 on one system and another number on some other system. Once rs232 interfaces came out so computers could talk directly to each other without having to use a modem, we used ascii translators to send files between computers for when people were changing systems so the old files could still be used. In fact, I did quite a bit of that for people to move and use the old eight bit (Apple II, TRS-80, C=64, and etc) data files on the pc.   \n\nFloppy trivia: There was a special gadget that cut slots out of the sides of soft floppies to make them flippies so you could get twice the storage. \n\nOne machine that is not talked about very much that was way ahead of it's time was Datapoint.  Datapoint was an octal not a hex based machine, which made things fun. It was networkable via arcnet. in fact the network addresses had to be configured with jumpers on the cards. That would never work today. The os was multi-user though jobs had to be submitted in batch order.

If the desktop itself is dead, than that makes Linux all that much more viable as a desktop OS. Assuming that you are correct about people abandoning desktop and laptop computers; Which OS are they abandoning? I propose that most Linux users are Linux fans, and that Linux fans are not likely to abandon desktop computing. Therefor, assuming you're right about desktops; Windows' market share should steadily decrease while Linux's market share steadily increases, and overall computer usage steadily decreases. \n\nI also will say that Ubuntu was my first Linux distro, and that I left Windows to use Ubuntu. I know another guy of whom that is also true. I owned computers running windows for 11 years before I ever tried Linux. I have two other friends for whom I have built or bought computers, and installed (exclusively) Linux on. One is running Ubuntu, and one is running Mint Debian (a distro which was founded upon Ubuntu, but has switched it's core out for Debian). Thus my argument here is that Ubuntu has done a good deal in my personal experience to switch people away from windows. \n\nAs far as your reasoning to migrate (and migrate our friends, etc...) from Ubuntu to Debian, I fully agree. Debian is very easy to use, modify and live with. It's only slightly harder than Ubuntu to install, though it's a good deal more complicated to (full) upgrade. I have been slowly migrating my own computers, and others' computers that I'm responsible for to Debian, or Debian based systems (like Mint and CrunchBang) for the past two years. I have been happier overall With Debian, and so have the people I administer computers for. I think that Debian as a desktop system is nearly perfect. Tools exclusive to Debian based systems like deborphan, localepurge and module-assistant only help to strengthen that opinion for me.\n\nI don't think that I would agree that we should be helping to migrate people to smartphones. At lease not to what are currently defined as smartphones. I think we should encourage people to use Free software applications, and to save and store their data in Free and \"open\" formats. I think the core of the system is less important in that regard than the user level applications. I'd rather see a loved one using free software applications like Firefox, and Libre Office on a Windows machine than Closed source and proprietary software on Android. At least that way they could retain their own data. Having a Free kernel does not offer as many tangible benefits to the lay-user as Free applications do. (Having both Free is obviously superior to either option)\n\nIf there were a Free smartphone OS that was as ready for the average user as Gnome, KDE, LXDE or XFCE (and perhaps others) are on the desktop, I'd probably concur if not agree with you on that point. As it stands I can not.\n\nThank you for contributing such an accessible and thought provoking show. While I disagree with several of your supporting points, I enjoyed hearing your whole show, and I agree with your overall point of questioning, if not abandoning Ubuntu. It was a good, and fun episode. I hope you decide to do more in the future.\n\nSorry to write a book in response, but like I said, it was thought provoking. :)\n\n-pokey","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Better yet, you should be able to start two instances of Skype Call Recorder and have one slider set to the left to record only on channel and the other instances slider moved all the way to the right, so you can record the other channel separately.

However, it was very difficult for me to listen to the last 2 episodes because of the extreme panning done on the voices.  This doesn't work very well with voice recordings because we don't naturally hear conversations split that way in real life.  Unfortunately, this meant that I had to skip these two episodes.\n\nIIRC, Skype Call Recorder does end up doing this to the recording (I remember going through this with Linux Basement).  The solution for me was to import the audio to Audacity (you can use any audio editor, of course), split the channels, and then pan them accordingly so they were only slightly panned from one another.  I kindly ask that you please consider this in your future episodes.  The quality of the audio isn't much of an issue as it's obvious the content is good, but the extreme panning becomes a distraction from the good content.  \n\nThanks!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I do agree and (although you alluded to it) I think you didn't explicitly mention how really *every application* and programming language also has it's very own package manager (Firefox, LibreOffice, Perl, Ruby etc.).\n\nI've run a fair variety of distros in my time too and this is a problem that also bugged me. That, and the fact that packaging systems often make life difficult. You may need to wait months for the next release until you can install the latest version of an application, or be forced to run an entirely unstable version of your distro even though you only care about one of two applications. Also, if something goes wrong, you can't easily jump back to a working system.\n\nWhile I agree that there are already too many packaging systems out there which do roughly the same thing I've found a system which truly fixes a lot of problems for me and it uses a very different and radical package manager. Amazingly, you didn't mention it in your comprehensive listing, but it's not surprising really.

Much like people believing that everyone runs either Gnome, (Unity,) KDE, XFCE or LXDE and that no other desktops matter.\n\nFirst of all I would say that GUI frontends aren't really a part of the package manager, hence I think those don't really matter in this discussion, and I think it is a bit unfair to count those alongside package managers.\n\nThe problem with saying that there are too many package managers is that it is like saying there are too many Linux distros.\n\nBecause of file system layout differences, differences in init scripts, differences in how current the distros want to stay, differences in if the want to do source or binary packages, differences in if they think it is the role of the package manager to handle dependencies, differences in if they want to do rolling release or separate release versions... and so on every distro would still need to have it's own set of repositories which would negate a lot of the benefits of having a single package manager since packages would still not be cross-compatible.\n\nThis means that as long as there is distro choice it seems impossible to ever make packages fully cross-compatible to the point where a user could install a package on any distro. A lot of packages would work if you put in a lot of user-interaction for where things are on your computer and you do packaging like sta.li where everything is statically linked so there are no dependencies... but it wouldn't work anyway if the package relies on a certain version of the kernel, X11 or a driver etc as statically linking those wouldn't really make sense.\n\nSince there is no one way to structure a Linux filesystem, a Linux init system or a Linux release schedule you will never really fix that issue if you do not want to cut Linux down to one single distro.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I rambled enough as it is, I'd hate to imagine how much more I would have had I brought those up.  yaourt (pacman alternative for arch linux)  has that ability and ebuild also can do that with perl.  It'd be really cool if that was a more standard thing.  Thanks for listening and the comment!\n\nKyashii,\n   There's nothing fashionable about it from my perspective.  I've heard almost noone complain of package system proliferation, in any of the forums, chatrooms,  mailing lists or news aggretators that I visit regularly.  In fact, I hear exactly the opposite on a fairly regular basis.  Someone excited about their project,  a new package manager that either fixes a certain problem in another one or a fun project they have been  'kicking around and have been working on for the last 6 months'  Possibly we hang out in different areas though.\n\n   I don't see packaging as similar to the 'everyone runs GNOME, KDE, ....  argument.  Those are about choice. Please refer to my comments about 'things able to run on the same system'\n\n  I don't believe the file system heirarchy or dynamic vs static libs or system init scripts as unscalable walls.  Are there differences to be figured out? Of course,  but a file that lies on libcups.so.1.2 or libcups.a relies on that library regardless of where it lives.  (use /etc/ld.so.conf)  THings like how the daemon gets started, obviously depends on the particular system, but to say that things like this make it impossible to have one packaging system but still allow multiple distros is something that I don't believe.

They are very dismissive over people's concerns about that feature.  That particular feature of X is one of my favorite things about the current typical Linux environment.\n\nI don't use Ubuntu. I haven't cared for Gnome since all the preferences started moving into the registry.  That's one of my least favorite features of Windows, I surely don't want it in Linux.  I care about the direction Ubuntu takes because they are the leader right now.  There seems to be way more hype around Ubuntu then the other distros combined.

There was a time when \"systems analysis\" was used. You evaluate the needs to solve a problem. If you have a web application where you only have a limited number of users and storage size is not a priority, why set up a high availability zillion multi-node servers for such a project. I.e. student testing lab at a college. Everything is in degrees. Secondly. the notion that a single server especially a linux box could not be secure is ludicrous. Sounds like someone who is inept at linux and wants to make excuses. Reminds me of some MSWindows administrators I used to know. Be that is at it may, considering how the highly touted Amazon services have had so many security issues, I definitely would not consider it a stellar example of a robust system at any level. Do not get me wrong I was a Novell, Linux, and MSWindows administrator for over ten years,  so I feel I might have a clue about all this. If you pay me enough, I will use any OS.\nBy the way, you actually can go from a single server to a multi node set up without taking anything down. The best way is to set up the original server ahead of time with the capabilities, so it is a matter of plug and play.

Also, if you are somewhere in the menus and you want to return to the wps you use the same key combo - home + select.\nAlso, at least on my Sansa e200, you can have it charge from a computer without accessing the disk by holding select while you plug in the usb cable.

","comment_text":"This is a copy of a post I made a while back about Android stuff...\nJohn Zimm  -  Aug 22, 2011  -  Limited\n\"This is my response to Bryan on LAS and his ideas on HP and Linux ect.. I am a newbie to Linux. I have completely switched over to it. So, here I am enjoying my old HP desktop with Pentium 4. Then I learn about the bearded dude, and I loved what he is saying about GNU. So I started to feel like this whole Linux thing isn&rsquo;t fake and is not lying to me. That is important. For example, I got made when I heard new ideas were formulated and High schools did not teach me these new things because they were not what we had been taught in the past&hellip; no flexibility, no courage and no respect for us to change the school books to reflect how history really looked or what led up to it. Or how we are animals ect. ect. You get the picture. So, now, after watching LAS and listening to other shows, I am interested in paying the data plan (for the first time) and getting a smart phone. So, I was really confused when I heard everyone talk about Android this and Android that. I don&rsquo;t give a shit about a cheap knock-off of Linux, or something that runs Linux in the background, or how ever you say it. I wanted to stick with what I just learned&hellip; LINUX. Everyone was talking about how flexible and scalable Linux is, but I can&rsquo;t have it on my phone? So, I moved on. I started to get interested in tablets&hellip; HOLLY SHIT, THOSE RUN THAT STUPID ANDROID, FAKE LINUX TOO. Remember, I am a newbie, so I don&rsquo;t have a sense of where things in Linux came from or started, or how great Android is. Sorry if I don&rsquo;t appreciate Android. But let's get real, The big company Google, didn't fit into my new found ideals. But, I want my Mint 11 on a tablet. Is that to much to ask for. I hate that I am not smart. I am just a geek-wanna-be. I hate that I can&rsquo;t pick one device at a time, (phone or tablet) and make Mint 11 run on it, then upload an iso for everyone to use. So, when I heard Bryan say that about how we should not be relying on other OSs that can be pulled after 46 days&hellip; I am totally , totally totally, on board. I do have other skills, and maybe I can help in some way. Let&rsquo;s get this BITCH rolling. When I used to daydream about this, I came up with naming the device that I was going to invent&hellip; wait for it&hellip; &ldquo;L&rdquo;. And after watching the LAS show, I came up with calling the distro, &ldquo;GLD&rdquo;, for GNU Linux Debian. PS,as I am about to hit share, I see a post below my,that says, \"Touchdroid, Android for HP Touchpad Project Started\". Why not Linux, for HP Touchpad project??????????????????????????\"","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

WebOS is quiet good imo. The homebrew community has compiled new kernels, cli etc. I've got it overclocked. Good stuff. Still they are just shiny toys. Even when i can install a proper linux distro, it will still be just a convienient coffee table device for quickly surfing to get tv listings or watching youtube vids. Oh lest i forget it is a great ereader, though a bit heavy. I'm glad i have one, but i have better things to drop $500 on. One other thing. All these type devices are driven by the apps that consumers will buy. No apps no gadget goodness. Remember BeOS or OS2? Had them both at one time. Both stable and much better than Win3/95, but as a user there just wasnt much stuff beyond the os itself to do.\nI would like someone to make an argument that these tablets are more than consumer trinkets mostly (latest status/ego boost hotness), i'd listen but i don't think it's going to happen.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Episode 0853 :: Pat Volkerding of Slackware Linux chats with Klaatu\n\nI'm not making this exception because it was \"better\", I would find it impossible to make such a call. The HPR community produces a massive amount of content and I have listened to every single one at least once. There has not been a single HPR show that I have not enjoyed and learned from.\n\nNor is it that it was submitted by Klaatu as given that he has submitted 12 1/2% of all shows, I would have written this long before now. Sure today's 'topic' was special - a interview with Patrick Volkerding the man behind SlackWare, the longest continually developed Linux distribution - but we've had other interviews with people of note before.\n\nThe reason for this deviation is simply because it embodies the qualities that I feel define Hacker Public Radio.\n\nIt's about taking a topic and exploring it, looking at all sides, exposing otherwise hidden and unknown facts, it's about events, it's about community, it's about people, it's about technology, it's about music, it's about history, it'a about life, it's about questioning - everything - our very existence - space time - ancient cultures. In short it's about \"Any topic that is of interest to Hackers\"\n\nIf you have never listened to a HPR then this is surely the best sample of what you are likely to find. Sure it arrived just in time to fill an otherwise empty slot, the audio isn't perfect, it might not follow a script, random people wander in and out, there may be tangents from the topic at hand but if you can open your ears to listen you'll hear the passion of the community, our community.

Both your words and actions illustrate the importance of maintaining an open and democratic Internet.\n\nRight now, Congress is debating a few pieces of legislation concerning the very real issue of online piracy, including the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and the Online Protection and Digital ENforcement Act (OPEN). We want to take this opportunity to tell you what the Administration will support&mdash;and what we will not support. Any effective legislation should reflect a wide range of stakeholders, including everyone from content creators to the engineers that build and maintain the infrastructure of the Internet.\n\nWhile we believe that online piracy by foreign websites is a serious problem that requires a serious legislative response, we will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\n\nAny effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small. Across the globe, the openness of the Internet is increasingly central to innovation in business, government, and society and it must be protected. To minimize this risk, new legislation must be narrowly targeted only at sites beyond the reach of current U.S. law, cover activity clearly prohibited under existing U.S. laws, and be effectively tailored, with strong due process and focused on criminal activity. Any provision covering Internet intermediaries such as online advertising networks, payment processors, or search engines must be transparent and designed to prevent overly broad private rights of action that could encourage unjustified litigation that could discourage startup businesses and innovative firms from growing.\n\nWe must avoid creating new cybersecurity risks or disrupting the underlying architecture of the Internet. Proposed laws must not tamper with the technical architecture of the Internet through manipulation of the Domain Name System (DNS), a foundation of Internet security. Our analysis of the DNS filtering provisions in some proposed legislation suggests that they pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online. We must avoid legislation that drives users to dangerous, unreliable DNS servers and puts next-generation security policies, such as the deployment of DNSSEC, at risk.\n\nLet us be clear&mdash;online piracy is a real problem that harms the American economy, threatens jobs for significant numbers of middle class workers and hurts some of our nation's most creative and innovative companies and entrepreneurs. It harms everyone from struggling artists to production crews, and from startup social media companies to large movie studios. While we are strongly committed to the vigorous enforcement of intellectual property rights, existing tools are not strong enough to root out the worst online pirates beyond our borders. That is why the Administration calls on all sides to work together to pass sound legislation this year that provides prosecutors and rights holders new legal tools to combat online piracy originating beyond U.S. borders while staying true to the principles outlined above in this response. We should never let criminals hide behind a hollow embrace of legitimate American values.\n\nThis is not just a matter for legislation. We expect and encourage all private parties, including both content creators and Internet platform providers working together, to adopt voluntary measures and best practices to reduce online piracy.\n\nSo, rather than just look at how legislation can be stopped, ask yourself: Where do we go from here? Don&rsquo;t limit your opinion to what&rsquo;s the wrong thing to do, ask yourself what&rsquo;s right. Already, many of members of Congress are asking for public input around the issue. We are paying close attention to those opportunities, as well as to public input to the Administration. The organizer of this petition and a random sample of the signers will be invited to a conference call to discuss this issue further with Administration officials and soon after that, we will host an online event to get more input and answer your questions. Details on that will follow in the coming days.\n\nWashington needs to hear your best ideas about how to clamp down on rogue websites and other criminals who make money off the creative efforts of American artists and rights holders. We should all be committed to working with all interested constituencies to develop new legal tools to protect global intellectual property rights without jeopardizing the openness of the Internet. Our hope is that you will bring enthusiasm and know-how to this important challenge.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis on legislation that provides new tools needed in the global fight against piracy and counterfeiting, while vigorously defending an open Internet based on the values of free expression, privacy, security and innovation. Again, thank you for taking the time to participate in this important process. We hope you&rsquo;ll continue to be part of it.\n\nVictoria Espinel is Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator at Office of Management and Budget\n\nAneesh Chopra is the U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Assistant to the President and Associate Director for Technology at the Office of Science and Technology Policy\n\nHoward Schmidt is Special Assistant to the President and Cybersecurity Coordinator for National Security Staff\n\nCheck out this response on We the People.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I think I know the answer to your &ldquo;heretical&rdquo; question, &ldquo;why are we not all using a language that is as efficient to run as C and as efficient to write as Python?&rdquo;: It is a lot harder than it looks. Python (specifically CPython) looks terrible in benchmarks, but for many real applications it is slower than C, but not enough slower to matter. Also, lots of smart people have tackled the problem from lots of different directions (C++, OCaml, Java, Unladen Sparrow, etc.) with limited success so far. And change is slow just because being an early adopter of a language is expensive, and being a late abandoner is even more expensive. But take a look at the PyPy project and the &ldquo;RPython&rdquo; language.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The original story was teens but they were supposed to be college kids in the final draft so I don&rsquo;t know what happened there. Major oversight! I also agree with your assessment of the diner scene: I should have included more description on how he found her and got her out. Good catch. Ditto for the bear&hellip; and A.I&hellip; and the chip&hellip; You gave me a lot to think about.\n \nI&rsquo;m glad you would be interested in hearing the sequel, which I hope to finish writing within the next few months, and I do hope you guys are willing to review that one on your podcast as well.

  {"id":464,"eps_id":1033,"comment_timestamp":"2012-07-27 12:16:36","comment_author_name":"Mike Hingley","comment_title":"Alternate viewpoinr","comment_text":"My counter argument to the central point made by your podcast is this : \n\nI feel almost intrisictly opposed to the stock RTFM answer - here are my reasons why : \n\n1. Elitism\nThis may not be intentional - but when someone says \"RTFM\" the subtle message it puts out is \"I know the answer, but I'm not going to tell you because I do not believe you are worthy of my time and energy because you have not displayed sufficient schooling in this area\".  To me - this represents a knowledge elite, where those that can and do,laugh down their noses at those that can't.  One thing I can't stand is elitism especially in the open source community, where access to information and resources is the ultimate leveller. \n\n2. Puts people off\nIt may be that the user asking that question has no background in the computer science aspects of computing, but approaches the use of computers like any other consumer device.  For example : I recently fitted some smoke alarms into my house.  the manual said that the light should flash every 45 seconds - but in reality it flashed every 10 seconds.  I phoned the help line and spoke to a technician who answered the question.  His response was much more useful to me as it answered my question directly.  I now feel much more confident in my ability to work with electronics not only from this company, but from others, as I know there is an element of support.\n\n3. Adds nothing\nIn reality all information relating to Linux is either gathered by reading the manual or source, or through experience with the product.  Therefore the stock answer to any query from anybody could be RTFM, and the chances are that there is a manual page or documentation out there that covers that subject.\n\n4. Makes assumptions about the users\nRTFM assumes that the user that has made contact is indeed able to read a manual.  To make such an assumption based on no information does us a disservice\n\n5. In some instances - inappropriate for the communication paradigm\nIf I contact a IRC help chat channel and all I am told is RTFM, then the channel could be hosted by bots which just respond RTFM.   If the help chat channel offers no help, then it ceases to be a useful tool.\n\n6. Aggressive\nThe use of offensive language in this term makes it inappropriate for use.  I always pride myself that the communications I have made within the open Source community are free from swears  -  I would have no problem with my parents, or grand parents, or little nieces and nephews reading what I have written. \n\n7. Competition\nThe point is that Microsoft, Oracle etc already have this type of facility - where questions can be asked and answered.  We're competing with these companies, and therefore we need to raise the bar.  Making someone slog through a reference book to find out why their network isn't working isn't competing so well.\n\n8. Obtuse\nResponding to a technical query from a user with a technical acronym only compounds the issue.  \n\n\nI want to table something  : I'd like to suggest that we censor ourselves from responding with RTFM - I'd like to ban the term, and instead suggest that we start to write things in plain english. \n\nFor example : \n\nOh - I'm sorry you've experienced an issue with the FOO widget under Distrix.  Let's see if we can't offer some advice.  It looks like the issue is , which means \n\nThere are a number of things we can try : \n\n1. instruction 1\n2. instruction 2\n3. instruction 3\n4. instruction 4\n\nIf you want to learn more about FOO widget, then you can find the man page by going to terminal and typing man FOO.\n\n---\n\nOnce we have done this a few times we can start to formulate strategies to solving the issue, which we can document.  \n\nThe important things I wanted to raise with my suggestion are : \n\n1. Empathy - we are empathising with the user.  This helps to establish a bond, and the user may feel happier that at least someone understood the issue.\n\n2. Information - we are presenting the user with some basic information about the issue they are having.\n\n3. Tasks - we are presenting some ideas that the user can try \n\n4. Further information - we are instructing the user how to get more information about the issue.\n\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I'd like to offer up a couple of suggestions, if I may.\n\nFirst is that your mic is good enough that you need a pop filter. When you say words that cause air to puff out of you, that air hits the mic element harder than the rest of your speech, and you get a \"pop\" sound. Do a search for \"DIY pop filter\" or \"how to pop filter\" and you'll find cheap or free solutions that work well.\n\nSecond is that the name Sean is pronounced like Shawn. It's just an alternate spelling. I'm a Sean Fournier fan too, so I knew who you were talking about.\n\nI think you did a good job of leveling the audio between the talking parts and the music parts.

This is why LGPL seems to be gaining popularity.\n\nI do think more software should be open, but I don't think it's likely to happen anytime soon as very few people are willing to pay money to support software that is free as in freedom since they can just get it also free as in beer. As long as proprietary software pays far better per hour for the developers it will still be there, and as long as it is the case I can't really blame developers.\n\nSo donate as much as you can to your favourite projects.

Maby he is ultimately right. I simply don&rsquo;t know.\nHe&rsquo;s right that sharing is a good thing.\nBut is it really an ethical issue whether or not you get some recipe, construction plans or source-code??\n\n---------------\n\n\nAnalyzing this...\n\nTony wrote: \"If you go to a backery and buy a cake, is it unethical if you don&rsquo;t get the recipe as well?\"\n\nThe analogy between recipe and source code, in the way you present it, is flawed.\n\nLet me explain: the cake is the OUTPUT of the recipe. If a recipe is freedomrespecting (by allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution with out without modification), then this does not apply to the OUTPUT, i.e. the cake. Put another way: the cake (output) is not the corresponding source of the recipe-steps performed. (See https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1116 at tracktime 30:58)\n\nTo fix the analogy. Here's an example of a violation of \"freedomrespecting recipes\":\nAssume a recipe-seller states: \"all my recipes are freedomrespecting.\" You then decide to purchase from him a recipe-executor-black-box, and a number of recipes on USB-stick. At home you plug in the recipes-USB-stick into the recipe-executor-black-box and select \"Grandma's ultraspecial chocolate cake\". The executor-black-box removes some ingredients from the connected ingredients-containers (flour, sugar, chocolate, etc.). You cannot see what's going on inside, but after one-and-a-half hours... out comes a cake!\nSo you tell yourself: well that's great, but I want to bake this cake with my own hands and change the steps slightly. You connect the recipes-USB-stick to your own computer, expecting to find the steps. But low and behold: you find that the \"recipes\" are only in a machine-readable binary format, that you cannot decipher them.\nThis is a freedomrespecting recipe violation!!! If the recipes really were free, you would have received not only the binary format, but the steps of the recipe in human-readable english as well!\n\nNow lets say you have aquired a freedomrespecting recipe for a cake (and here I really mean a free recipe, in that it is not obfuscated or coded; but instead a description of steps). Lets say you have a bakery and sell a customer the cake (baked according to the recipe): do you have to give the customer the recipe?\nNo, since the cake is the output. You are not selling the customer the steps to produce the cake.\n\nBut now you might try and apply this to software and say: \"But look here: the binary program is the output of the source code. So if you pass on the binary program, you don't have to pass on the souce code, right?\"\nThis would be a misunderstanding, since the program is NOT the output of the source code. Instead: the program is merely the output of a compiler. But the binary program is a direct transformation of the source code: The steps in the program, are still the steps in the source code. We say: the source code is the \"CORRESPONDING SOURCE\" of the program binary.\nThus with free software, the software ... in all the forms it is distributed: binary, etc. needs to include the \"corresponding source\", that give one the freedom to modify it.\n\n\nTony wrote: \"If you buy a radio, is it unethical if you don&rsquo;t get the construction plans for it?\"\nThis analogy between construction plans and souce code is also flawed.\nThe construction plans can be free (freedomrespecting). But the construction plans are not the corresponding source of the radio: The radio does not perform the construction steps. The radio does not have a corresponding source, since it is the output of the construction steps.\n\n\nTony wrote: \"If you buy some software, is it unethical if you don&rsquo;t get the source-code?\"\nDepends on your view. You can certainly argue: yes. First off: the steps the program runs, are the steps that are described in the source code. Furthermore: if the program runs on a general purpose computer, then you could easily change it (lets say it is not software that is burned into a ROM for an applianc like a toaster.) Then it is only fitting that you should really be able to make use of this possibility (changing the program on your computer), and that requires a form of the program that is best suited to do that job: the corresponding souce. \nOn the other hand: If you have proprietary software, then - even though you are running the software on a device that easily allows changes - the owner of the propriertary software has deliberately decided to make this difficult or illegal for you to do. Then only the owner controls the program, and you might be called a fool for using it.\n\n\nIf you buy a processor, is it unethical if you don&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;hardware description language&rdquo;-description (HDL) of the processor?\n\nDepends on your intent: do you want to analyze what the processor's logic is doing, and then have the possiblity to make changes to the processor and create your own (with the guarantee that your logic will be on the chip [and not some fab's back-door logic])? \nIf you buy a processor created by a fab with modern photolithography, then you get a chip that you cannot change. In that case you don't need the HDL-description. BUT: if you buy the whole fab itself (oh: so you have those billions of dollars?!), then you have the possibility to make changes. In that case you'd be a fool, if you don't insist on getting all steps, and descriptions, etc. for making the processor chip, and being able to change it, for example if the chip happens to have a serious bug! If you cannot fix the chips hardware-bug, you'll probably be out of business very soon.\n\nIf on the other hand you buy a FPGA (not so expensive: say 500 dollars or cheaper), and the processor is synthesized on that FPGA, then you can change the hardware-description (via the HDL) and load the changes onto the FPGA. In that case, you'd be a fool, if you don't get the freedomrespecting HDL-description (e.g. in Verilog or VHDL code), in order to actually do that.\n\n\n\n\nThe free software definition (of Stallman), applies to the source code and to the binary program. The 2 (source and binary) are linked: the steps in the binary program are the steps in the source code: they are just a transformed version of the same thing. Except that one is easy to change (source code) and the other is incredibly difficult to change (binary program).\nThe source code is the corresponding source of the binary program. Free software gives you the freedom to make changes (that you can realistically realize, since that's what you can do on general purpose computers), by providing you with the corresponding source.\n\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Having watched the entire series your comments seem to contradict everything I got from the show. Even if you seem to think it's a crude historical re-enactment, I am very disappointed that you could not see past that and notice as I did that as the series progresses they each hone their particular skills. Case in point the Oxen and the men develop their muscles and take pleasure and satisfaction from the hard labour so that by the end the humans and animals had formed genuine bonds. \n\nHowever we are all entitled to our opinions so to make it clear, what I was trying to point out is that there is a wealth of information available to you on living with nature and having healthy food from the writings of peoples who lived prior to the onset of Industrialization. While you may mock the historians who like yourself were attempting to recreate the skills lost to time, the information they were basing their actions on was written by people who will have used those skills all their lives. Those peoples left detailed records of their traditions, practices, diets, technology describing how life was lived for centuries. If you can see past the reality show aspects, you might want to chase down the books that they mention in the show which should be out of copyright by now. There is probably an equivalent stock of literature available to you from the Czech Republic.\n\nIn your show you mentioned that the families were inaccessible in the winter, so I understand Weston A Price would have only seen the societies during a time of plenty. He may have seen them as healthy people and attributed it to their diet, which given he was only there for the summer would have been full of rich fatty foods. This would seem to agree with what the historians say the diet of a homesteader would have been in the summer. This would seem to back up your point of giving our children rich fatty foods as the evidence as presented would suggest that this would lead to health.\n\nHowever as the historians point out, during the winter their diet changed radically to the point of starvation. I don't know if Dr. Price took this into account or not but if you assume that he did then the advice to eat fatty foods should be given with the caveat that it should be for a short period of time and that you should also starve yourself for a significant portion of the year. If you wish to eat a pre-industrialised diet, then research that diet and present it in it's entirety with evidence from multiple sources. Sources which this television series proves are available to you.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The evidences I based the whole episode where in the notes, which you or anyone else is free to follow up and research into the actual information given. The food's and habits and hense health was already modified during those periods historically reconstructed in the BBC's series, and many of the practices were actually the start of what we now have and consider normal today. Also many of the practices shown are actually part of the reason why many people could be fooled into leaving the country side, where they should be healthy and happy, to the city from the false promise of an easy and more afluent life without the drudgery and ill health they HAD come to experience in the country side by actual BAD practices in order to sell often what was the best of their produce, cheaply to the city merchants so the country people could buy cheap low nutrient dense and stomach filling foods. \n\nIt seems to me that this is something more personal with you as your childhood background on an actual farm has convinsed you that its a bad way to live, and perhaps how you were doing it it was ?

However when the clever people actually return to the country side, relearn the skills, judge in a balanced way how the old and new can be used together, and more importantly, which was the point of my presentation, actually understand what healthy food is, and educate and share the information to consumers can therefore actually sell direct (no merchants) and get a fair price which would mean they don't have to go down the path of continually cutting corners and chepening the food they may sell.\n\nBefore you quote me yet more things that you think I've not read or don't understand, why don't you follow up on the information I've shared and look more deeply at what is presented, these things I've mentioned are beyound being merly my own opinion.\n\nI repeat, the journey towards industrializtion happened gradually, the cheapening of our foods, even in the coutry also was gradual, and in the societies you mention where documention was made these were subject to those slow changes. This is why the book by Weston A Price is such a treasure as he found and studied 14 groups who were isolated, to you understand the significance of that ? they were actually through necessaty following what they had done for many generations and hadn't been exposed by the gradual pressuers of external trade and merchants expoloytation which if you had the connections to the larger world would have effected all other peoples.\n\nAs for not having enough foods during winter time, you are talking nonsense, what you say may be true in that it actually happened. However understanding food technology, how hight quality foods can be harvested and stored for long periods, if you don't try and buy suger/coffee and other crap from merchants from presure of wifes or apparent perseption of luxsury, then people would/could of had more than enough food for themselves. Of course assuming the crazy burdon of taxes to cripple people and steal from them wasn't also in effect, forcing them to give up their wealth of good foood made from their own labour.\n\nI ask you kindly to actually study the two books or website I mention so you can avoid just sounding plain stupid, as your trying to defend you current life position, which I'm not intentionally trying to undermine. This episode was to upset anyone, just allow anyone make a concious decision based on actual good science. If you look at the foods suggested to eat during religious fasting, for apparent clensing and the times of year these were eaten I can help us think a bit why these rules may have been made, when we understand what those foods actually do to us.\n\nHave you seen yet the 2 hour video I posted in the comments to these videos ?\n\nIf you feel so strongly about this, I'd be happy to talk with you or record another episode with your help, or your wifes, you mention she'd heard of the books. Otherwise I think it would be better to actually study what I mentioned and comment in relation to those things, not trying to proof that its somehow a burdemsom and toiling life with no meaning and something we can't go back to (I think we'd never want to go back to those historyical times presented in the bbc serious) however there is something to learn and change in our current lifes.\n\n/END Rant","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I accept that you are greatly affected by his works but not to challenge the theories would simply be unscientific and would elevate his book to that of a religious work that must be accepted on faith alone. Therefore I want to find a literate people who were isolated in a manner described by Dr. Price and who documented their own lives. By comparing both works we get a fuller picture of the truth.\n\nI am genuinely surprised that you would say that people in the 1600's were already affected by industrialization of the food chain. At the time the only industrialization would have be localized to water mills which were isolated and not available everywhere. The industrialization that you speak of is generally accepted to have started after 1760 a full hundred years after the time period in discussion in the show. \n\nDo you have a specific time period in mind where the type of life studied by Dr. Price would have been practiced on the Islands of Ireland or England ? The reason I focus on those is because those regions are the places where I am most familiar with and it would greatly assist in my ability to be able to call information to hand. I would appreciate it if you could keep your reply civil and avoiding drawing conclusions about other peoples live choices.\n\nRegards,\n\nKen.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

If you consider this or anything I've said religious in some way I'm sorry for you about that, and you still seem to miss the point. Did you watch the 2 hour video I shared ?\n\nThe foods we eat are not only effected by the degree of visible industrialization in its production or pressesing, although that does later effect our foods in a very big way, but more importantly our foods and that which our ansesters ate, even back to roman times or perhaps later ? was effected by your position or status in life what you could afford or what you couldn't and perhaps actually choise to sell the best in order to by a larger quantity of something of less value or other things that might be anti foods in fact.  Industrialization has just made these foods and the effects much more obvious. A choice to eat predomantly low nutrient foods, grain, potatoes, rices, just a few examples and reduce the nutrient dense foods in diets, has happened throughout the ages, for perhaps simular reasons, but I'm not a historian.\n\nSo which that I hope you understand the pointless ness in entering into some discussion, along your line of reasoning, as your missing the point through your current lack of knowlege of what actual food is good to eat, which foods would be preferable sold to markets and therefore depriving a family of the best nutrition no mater which time in history you care to look at. The isolated peoples had plenty, generally had little need to trade or aquire more expensive things at the cost of their valuable and priced foods, and that is the point.\n\nLets have a talk about it more, if your still interested, when you've at least had chance to follow up the links, references, books, videos I mentioned. If they still interest you or anyone else ? I have nothing to proove, or to say which isn't said and stated clearly by more clever and respected people than me and after all the proof is in the pudding, which I and many people are already greatfull to around the world.

I appreciate that is difficult but we should be at least able to determine what the selection criteria was for the sample groups studied by Dr. Price. Can you share with us what definition he assigned to determine that the \"isolated peoples\" were isolated enough. \n\nWould you accept that Ireland in the period of 400-800AD would meet the definition you give of \"The isolated peoples had plenty, generally had little need to trade or aquire[sic] more expensive things at the cost of their valuable and priced foods\". Ireland at the time was outside the sphere of Roman influence and had abundant resources.

So, it may be worth a second look.\n\nOn another hand, Manjaro is a great distribution. I highly encourage you to take a look at it. It is more mature than Cinnarch and look just as gorgeous. The XFCE spin seems to be a bit more polish than the Cinnamon spin, but they are both really nice.\n\nFinally, I can't wait to hear your episode entitled \"I have install Arch, now what?\". I have lots of interrogations regarding the use of Arch, particularly on the subject of how I should manage the AUR... Should I use a AUR helper or do everything by hand?

(Opus' support is already more widespread than speex's is.) If there are no objections, I would suggest replacing the ~28kbps .spx feed with opus encoded at \"--bitrate 20\". This looks like it should be roughly a high enough bitrate that speech quality should be outstanding, while leaving enough bitrate for the possibility for the opus encoder to switch to MDCT mode (\"CELT\") when it detects non-speech sounds occasionally.\n\nThe quality should remain the same or probably even better, while reducing the file downloads by an average of around 25%-30% more beyond what speex already gets it down to.\n\nAlso too, sorry for missing the show recording.

For instance, if I make a fire to heat up with, I put a great big log at the back to deflect heat back at the fire and at me. I also try to keep my burning logs above my fire ring (but below the top of the big log at the back) if I want heat. If I want to cook, or if it's hot out, I'll try to keep my logs below the top of the fire ring. \n\nWhen I really realized to potential of the radiated heat was the time me and some friends were at a really big bon fire (REALLY BIG, like >1/4 acre, and the pit was an unused quarry). we were at least 25-35 yards away from any actual burning wood, and we still all got too hot to stand there unless we had something to \"shade\" ourselves with.

Also having a stock of Raspberry PI loners helps.\n\nI would argue that there are times when discussing free as in freedom can be used to good effect. I have used the argument when someone couldn't open a document on their word processor because the proprietary format had been updated.\n\nI have found the frugal argument to be more of a hindrance than a help. Namely the \"you get what you pay for\" or \"pay peanuts, get monkeys\" spring to mind. So rather than saying it's free, you can explain that large companies pay for support. Or, that you will be expected to contribute back in some way once you are up to speed. It usually say that in a Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando accent.\n\nKen.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

For photographs, the geolocation is always assumed to be \"where the photographer was standing when the picture was taken\" and there aren't too many cases where any other interpretation makes much sense. (In a telephoto of an obvious landmark it might make sense to geotag with the location of the landmark instead, or for an image of a map, it might make sense to geotag the center of where the map represents). As far as I know, photo geotagging only supports a single geolocation per image as well [not necessarily counting geoTIFF], so options are limited.\nWith vorbiscomments explicitly designed to support multiples of all tags, the way I think of it is you put in a geo_location tag for any location that is relevant to the recording: imagine that someone wants to generate openstreetmap (or Google Maps or whatever) pages with markers that go with the audio files. The way I figure it, the geo_location tags should provide the locations of all of the markers that the hypothetical link-maker would want to show. (It's probably worth proposing a \"description\" addition to the geo_location tag now that you mention this, though: something like \"geo_location;35.1592;-98.4422;;Nowhere, OK used as example location\"\n\nAlso, thanks for teaching ME something - I usually tend to think of playback as something that doesn't need an internet connection, so I feel stupid for only thinking of web links to relevant pages (what I used the \"chapter###url\" tags for, e.g. the id3v2.3 chapter's URL should have been a link to the specification online) and somehow completely missed using it to pull a slideshow from the internet while playing. Now I have to try that... (For me, chapter marks are more about having convenient \"jump to:\" points in the audio.) It's worth noting that doing \"fetch pictures from the internet\" like that also makes it a way to put \"web bugs\" in audio files...\n\n(Finally: I should say I don't necessarily disagree with your contention of how one SHOULD use the \"artist\" tag...well, actually I do but less strongly and not because that's not what the specification says. The cases where it matters seem like they wouldn't come up TOO often in practice. The examples that come to mind are mostly things like \"Darryl Hall and John Oates\" and \"Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel\" and \"William Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan\", all of whom are so well known as duos that \"Hall and Oates\", \"Simon and Garfunkel\", and \"Gilbert and Sullivan\" are practically all single-word names (kind of like that \"colladoody\" video game people were going on about...) and makes sense as a \"singlet\".  On the other hand, there's \"Ebony and Ivory\" (Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney?), where I think it would definitely be more appropriate to follow the specification and give each \"artist\" their own tag. I just think it's more consistent to use all of the tags the same as per specification, and more people using the tags correctly will encourage playback software to support it correctly.)","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Everything else should be included in a separate file that itself is dedicated to hold the metatadata. That file might include locations for where other item might be found, eg, a url to the poster location, or a link to the wikipedia article. \n\nThe main reason for this would be to keep the complexity of the playout device as simple, and therefore as cheap , as possible. Your argument that there is enough space in a media file to hold all the metadata breaks down, once you start adding metadata in multiple languages, or extending it to add reviews, sleeve notes, wikipedia articles, reviews etc. At that point the text begins to get very significant indeed and runs the risk of been outdated very quickly.\n\nFields like, Title/Artist/Album/Track Number/Length, should be included as they are (usually not always) the same in every language, and give playout devices enough information for to display something useful, while another another more compiles, independent, process gathers the richer metadata from all over the web.\n\nIn an ideal world a single additional field with a global unique identifier would be enough to identify the work to the player, and allow it to go out an locate the metadata file, which in turn would link to other sources of information.\n\nKen.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I know that you are going to convert to ogg, mp3, speex and possibly opus, but still a 16-bit input file should be more than adequate in 99.999 percent of the cases.  Only when music is involved might it be necessary to use 24-bit, but even then, unless the source is recorded @ 24-bit it's really un-necessary.\n\nAlso, I was surprised there was no effort made to do noise removal, or level the tracks.

You are of course correct that the celcius scale is equally arbitrary, but at least there is a known reason for it.

The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point. The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0 &deg;F. \"\n\nNot that seems to support your point but then we have \"The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface. This was assigned as 32 &deg;F. \" - Which begs my question why pick 32 degrees for that ?\n\nContinuing \"The third calibration point, taken as 96 &deg;F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.\" So he may have been using a multiple of 32 but why ?\n\nAlso - you owe me a show :)\n\nKen.\n\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The switch cost between versions of Linux is much lower than the switch cost from MacOS or Windows.\n\nOn not being an ass-hat.

Proprietary software isn't evil, it's ineffective for a particular set of desired outcomes.\n\nOn command-lines. Really, Aq? It's a bug if there's not a GUI to do everything the user wants to do? Interestingly the CLI way of doing most things is the same for several years, if not eternally, but the GUI changes with the wind. Linus gave the GNOME project hell over this very thing. Stop breaking user-space without a good reason, and I'll stop teaching people to solve their problems from the CLI whenever possible. CLI's are powerful, so are chain-saws.

Moreover, things aren't as segregated as some may assume when they hear the word \"chroot\".  From the end users point of view, you can just run programs and not worry about where they originate or how it works under-the-hood.  If you want a web browser from one distro, steam from another, a window manager from yet a third, you can just do that and they all play along together as though they were all from the same distro.

We needed something simple at work to keep sales quotes in but we are quite a small company so a full CRM would be overkill so I thought a wiki might be a good idea. I looked at LOADS, but decided that didiwiki (well ciwiki) was simple enough that everyone could use it with around 10 minutes training. We have been running it for around 3 and a half years now and a quick \" ls .didiwiki | sed '/.prev.1/d' | wc -l \" shows that there are 1137 pages in our .didiwiki folder. I've found that the built in browser search ctrl^ f works better when searching through page titles. Also backing it up is a piece of cake! I just have a script that runs at 4pm everyday which gzips the whole .didiwiki folder and emails it to me.

I would first like to strongly disagree with the section where you discuss LibReSSL before adding another suggestion.\n\nYour Ad hominem argument against Theo de Raadt (10:23:00) was unmerited, and while people may criticise his tact, he has a long history of producing and managing secure projects.\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt: \"He is the founder and leader of the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects\". \n\nTo address your other points in that section.\n1. \"I would stick with OpenSSL and give LibReSSL a pass, at least until such a time as they show a long track record of success\".\nThe developers of LibReSSL have a long track record of success as they are the same people that bring you OpenSSH. They are noted for been able to produce secure software. So much so that Linux Torvalds said of the team, \"I think the OpenBSD crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys, in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them.\" From a practical point of view everyone running any Linux Distribution is more than likely already running and trusting OpenSSH.\nFrom https://www.libressl.org/: \"LibReSSL is primarily developed by the OpenBSD Project\". \nFrom https://www.openssh.com/: OpenSSH is developed by the OpenBSD Project.\n\n2. \"A good general rule in security is that new code is much more dangerous than code that has been around for a long time\"\nThe whole heart bleed issue proves this to be false. The rule itself is based on the premise that if it's around a long time, many people have reviewed the code and many bugs have been fixed. This is a rewording of \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\", Linus's_Law argument which you yourself criticise in the episode. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law \n\nMany people skip the caveats in the formal version \"Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone\". The heart bleed code was caused by not having a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, and yet this is exactly what the OpenBSD Project brings to the table.\n\nFurthermore LibReSSL is not \"new code\", but rather it is \"forked code\". They are fixing old existing bugs on OpenSSL and nothing is preventing OpenSSL from implementing the fixes they discover.\n\n3. Your argue that removing code and \"stuff they don't care about\" doesn't look good.\nI would point out that that is not a bad thing and was widely supported when LibreOffice forked OpenOffice. Michael Meeks celebrates this by publicising 38,714 known unused methods in LibreOffice. \"One of the unfortunate things that LibreOffice inherited, as part of the several decades worth of unpaid technical debt, is unused code that has been left lying around indefinitely. This was particularly unhelpful when mingled with the weight and depth of the useful code we have around the place.\"\nFrom https://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2012-01-09-unused.html \n\nSo finally I would suggest that \"Mono Culture is bad\" should be added to your list. Having (cooperating) competing systems, is not a bad thing as it encourages development, and innovation. Over reliance on any one piece of software is a bad thing. We saw that in the fields of Operating systems, web browsers and now in Security Libraries. ","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The OpenSSL code worked well for a long time until a very subtle error crept in. So the question is whether we will more quickly get to a more secure state by developing a mature code base or by throwing it out and starting over. In general, I maintain that fixing the mature code is a better practice.\n\nSecond, announcing almost immediately that that you have thrown out 90,000 lines of code (the number I recall) does not tom e suggest careful thought so much as a hack-and-slash mentality, and I don't like that in security. Calm deliberation usually works better.\n\nThird, from the reports I read one of the things that was discarded as an unnecessary feature was Windows compatibility. Even though I support free software, I recognize that we need to share the Internet with a shit-ton of Windows machines, and I would prefer that they be as secure as possible.\n\nI totally agree on Mono culture, and I hope that LibreSSL provides good competition. I did not mean to imply that LibreSSL should not exist, only that Iwould be very cautious about adopting anything unproven.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

They started with the existing OpenSSL code and worked from their. So they are using the exact same \"mature code\" and any issue they find are also issues in OpenSSL. Once fixed they are added to LibReSSL and _remain_ in OpenSSL. However, Do not mistake \"old code\" for \"tested code\". It was not tested, which was your third point \"Bugs are not shallow if the eyeballs are not there.\" Now that people *are* looking at the code bugs are been found. Case in point the new team brought on board by the Linux Foundation to help fix OpenSSL reported on 5th June 2014: CVE-2014-0224: \"a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server.\"\n\nSo let's look at what was actually removed in the first week. arstechnica have an interview with Theo de Raadt and he describes exactly what they removed.\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/\n--------------------------------------------------------\nde Raadt said there were \"Thousands of lines of VMS support. Thousands of lines of ancient WIN32 support. Nowadays, Windows has POSIX-like APIs and does not need something special for sockets. Thousands of lines of FIPS support, which downgrade ciphers almost automatically.\"\n...\nThere were also \"thousands of lines of APIs that the OpenSSL group intended to deprecate 12 years or so ago and [are] still left alone.\"\n...\nDe Raadt told ZDNet that his team has removed 90,000 lines of C code. \"Even after all those changes, the codebase is still API compatible,\" he said. \"Our entire ports tree (8,700 applications) continue to compile and work after all these changes.\"\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo to summarise the facts:\n90,000 lines of *unused* or *obsolete* code is removed from the LibReSSL code base.\n90,000 lines of *unused* or *obsolete* code remains in the OpenSSL code base.\n\nIf the Industry Average is 17.5 errors per 1000 lines of code*, and there are 90,000 lines of code, we can calculate that the OpenSSL code has 1,575 MORE errors than LibReSSL\n\n( 90000 / 1000 ) x ( ( 50 - 15 ) / 2 ) = 1,575 \n* \"Code Complete\" by Steve McConnell. \nBlame Charles in NJ if my math is wrong.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The episode and show notes are excellent, and you even made *some* progress in convincing me that a linking table may be needed. I would have liked a more detailed explanation as to why it's a bad idea to use a comma separated list backed with actual processor utilization tests to prove this. Even then I'm willing to argue that the choice of a more inefficient method, is better if the system can be kept simpler. Remember that HPR is a volunteer run effort and we cannot guarantee that we will always have DBA's available to help out. I am more than happy to select a less efficient process if it means that more people can understand it.\n\nDon't forget that the purpose of the database is to support the distribution of shows. The shows are primarily distributed using RSS and therefore we do not have a choice in the data model, as that is imposed upon us. While a show->host may be better modeled in a Relational database as a many to many relationship the fact is that in a RSS Item element it is a 1:1 relationship. As in: there can be only one //item/author element in the feed, so what we are trying to do isn't even possible in RSS 2.0. In the Atom syndication standard it is possible to do it using either multiple atom:author or atom:contributor elements. However even in that case it is still a 1:n relationship and not a many to many. A show is an independent item and has 1 or more authors or 0 or more contributors.\n\nAlso the use of an RDBMS is a legacy of our history and could change in the future. As DeepGeek suggested a long time ago, it should be possible to run the entire system using XSLT to merge XML fragments. This is now well supported by Atom (atom:source) and HTML5 (html:article). In this case the back end could conceivably not even have a database.\n\nAs Dave is aware, I may change my mind over night and accept your vision but today I'm still not convinced. \n\n- https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltauthorgtSubelementOfLtitemgt\n- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#page-24\n- https://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-article-element\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database\n\nKen.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

A big drawbig of XML is it is stuck with representing top-down, tree-like structures.\n\nWhat you are doing by putting a comma-seperated list of values in a single column of a table is turning another table through 90 degrees.  The problem, apart from the obvious one of there now being data items in this table that are not identified by the key, is one of scalability.  How long is the field? 1024 characters?  What happens when it runs out of space?\n\nI know that in this application you are not exactly writing a multi-user client/server database application with many concurrent users and transactions happening every few tens of milliseconds, but compromises should not be made in the interest of programmer comfort with the SQL.  That ultimately leads to performance compromises.\n\nBut even with the largish number of shows to date and the number of hosts, it doesn't represent a big dataset.  But a system which can support something big from the start will not need tearing down and re-hashing as things grow.\n\nI guess your hands are a bit tied if you don't know the future platform resources, like whether you will always have a sensible RDBMS back-end available.\n\nMy show was pretty theoretical.  I'm more used to large systems.  In the past I have worked on e-commerce systems for big vendors, and on world-wide client/server stuff.\n\nI usually take the attitude that a heavy-duty solution can handle small-fry without breaking into a sweat, but the reverse is not true.

I would expect it to be a descriptive string, perhaps one already used in a system, or maybe a new one. Usually you'd want to refer to existing tags when tagging an entity in your database I imagine, so you can see if the tag is \"open source\" or \"open-source\".\n\nIn your interface, if you wanted to re-use a tag for a new entity then would be good if your system offered it in a menu or a list or let you start typing it and generated the matches as you type (like Google does in browsers). To do that you'd need a searchable table containing one tag per row.  If you were typing in a tag and you made a typo the error would be more obvious in such a scheme. (You'd need Javascript to do this in a browser though.)\n\nThen a tagged entity associated with many tags would have multiple entries in a cross-reference table. You'd probably want to store your tags with a case-insensitive variant or build a case-insensitive index too.\n\nYou wouldn't want to store the tags in a comma-separated list in the entity (no idea why I thought of that design) since you couldn't then implement a rapid lookup as you typed. Plus you'd have duplication, couldn't easily build an index, etc, etc.\n\nDoes that make sense? Mike can probably explain this more clearly :-)","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

MaryTTS on the other hand is bloated and the voice I have heard is not very much better than I am used to with eSpeak.\n\nSpeaking as a blind computer user, small footprint and fast, crisp operation is far more important than the sound of the voice.  I fail to see how I could write a long text document on a modest machine and expect MaryTTS to keep up with the fact I have been typing for thirty years.\n\nAnd I am speaking as a blind person.\n\nWith one or two notable exceptions, possibly the use of a TTS engine by children with print disabilities other than blindness, nobody need look any further than eSpeak, IMHO.\n\nWhere something like MaryTTS _might_ win, is in the creation of static wav files for repeated use, but for on-the-fly tts, nothing beats eSpeak.\n\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

As someone who started programming on the ZX81 and Atari 400 I can appreciate compact code. \n\nThe eSpeak voice is intelligible, and so I'm lead to believe, can still be understood at high speeds. \n\nThe eSpeak voice is generally not aesthetically pleasing to those less familiar with TTS. I think Ken was looking to the MaryTTS voices to find something more appealing to the general listener.\n\nHaving had a little more time to play with MaryTTS I can now appreciate that although seemingly more natural some elements of the voices are less intelligible at times. This may be the clipping you referred to on the mail list (I don't know because I don't really have a vocabulary to describe TTS voice quality). What I have noticed is that there are two types of MaryTTS voices,  conversely to expectations the ones with the larger data-set appear to be less intelligible. \n\nWhich if any of the Mary voices are the clearest/cleanest?\n\nThe goals of eSpeak and MaryTTS are somewhat different, the Mary project appears to be a university research project. Having had a bit of a dig around in the MaryTTS code, I've found that it includes a lot of tools for recording and creating voices. There is also a whole range of effects processing and other tools to amend the vocal output model. Its definitely not a light weight TTS solution, but I don't think that was ever the intention.\n\nI did notice that eSpeak can create static wav files using the -w switch so it probably wins there too.\n\nWhere MaryTTS or similar projects may win out over eSpeak would be to provide a more suitable voice to those who rely on speech synthesis to be able to speak. I recently heard this TED talk. https://www.ted.com/talks/rupal_patel_synthetic_voices_as_unique_as_fingerprints . The voices featured here appear to be a great improvement over MaryTTS, but I don't know what software they are using or if it is open source. ","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

This was not clear and may lead someone to assume that VNC in itself is secure.\n\nhttps://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/vnc/sshvnc.html\n\"VNC uses a random challenge-response system to provide the basic authentication that allows you to connect to a VNC server. This is reasonably secure; the password is not sent over the network. Once you are connected, however, traffic between the viewer and the server is unencrypted, and could be snooped by someone with access to the intervening network. We therefore recommend that if security is important to you, you 'tunnel' the VNC protocol through some more secure channel such as SSH.\"\n\nEven the \"reasonably secure\" statement is challenged here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing#Security\n\"By default, RFB is not a secure protocol. While passwords are not sent in plain-text (as in telnet), cracking could prove successful if both the encryption key and encoded password are sniffed from a network. For this reason it is recommended that a password of at least 8 characters be used. On the other hand, there is also an 8-character limit on some versions of VNC; if a password is sent exceeding 8 characters, the excess characters are removed and the truncated string is compared to the password.\"\n\nI have also seen VNC security questioned for not requiring a username and password.\n\nRecommendations:\nuse the -localhost option so that only local (and tunneled) connections are allowed\nuse ssh tunneling\nuse the maximum size password allowed","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It has meant a lot to me.\n\nThere are lots of problems with FB, but as you say, communities are made of people. That a corporation should be the intermediary is not nice, but FB can be a very useful tool.\n\nAs long as one doesn't put all one's (\"social\") eggs in one basket.\n\nTake care\n\nMikael a.k.a inscius\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I would like to make two additions to your explanations.\n\n1) Unison in fact does *not* need the GUI installed. To set up the profile, you can also use an editor with the help of the (admittedly longish) documentation. And if used with the options -auto -ui text (it may select -ui text automatically, if no GUI is installed), it will show you the file list on the terminal and ask you for input there if needed.\n\n2) To be more flexible in what can be synced (and to address your problem of capitalisation), I use the following trick:\n- Create a new subdirectory in ~/.unison for each profile (I call them \"-links\" with  being the ssh hostname for the remote sync partner). This subdirectory becomes the root directory for your profile.\n- Fill that subdir with symbolic links to the items you want to sync. E.g. cd ~/.unison/laptop-links &amp;&amp; ln -s /home/myname/Documents docs\n- That way the directory to be synced can be called whatever you like, as long as the two symlinks have the same name on both sides.\n- This also allows me to sync single files within a directory (e.g. ~/.vimrc) but not the dir itself, and also to sync directories that don&rsquo;t share the same root, such as ~/docs and /mnt/data/music.\n- Lastly, to make it all work, you must tell Unison to follow the symlinks you made. For this, add this to the profile config:\nfollow = Regex [^/]+\nThe Regex (regular expression) simply matches any character that is not a slash, hence everything on the topmost directory level (until the first slash).\n\nCheers.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The Bread Bible. New York, NY: WW Norton &amp;\nCompany, inc.\n\nISBN 0-393-05794-1\n\nRecipe is on page 232.\n\n\nNeeded equipment: (not in recipe, but it'll save you time)\n\nRolling pins, 1 per person is best\nClean counters or cutting boards\nTea Towels or Oiled plastic for covering dough\n        We usually go with the towels to cover.\nBrush suitable for use with butter\nSkillet (cast iron or nonstick), bigger is better\nAn extra skillet &amp; spice grinder if using whole spices\nTurner suitable for use on skillet\nCouple of mixing bowls\nMeasuring spoons\nStand mixer or food processor capable of mixing dough (or by hand)\nFood scale\n\n\n\n290g (2c) Whole Wheat Flour, as fresh as possible\n(alternately, equal parts Whole Wheat &amp; Unbleached All-Purpose Flour)\n6.6g (1t) salt\n11.7g (1.5t) dry milk\n177g (3/4c) water at room temperature\n\nThis makes one batch of dough. The filling recipe below fills two\nbatches of dough. (We made 4 batches of dough as you may recall.)\n\n(It is possible to swap half the water with scalded milk that has been\ncooled back to lukewarm. We did not do this; we used the dry milk.)\n\nThe recipe itself calls for a Food Processor or to do it by hand. We\nused a stand mixer, so this is somewhat from memory.\n\nWhisk together all of the dry ingredients first until well-blended. Then\nmix in the water. We mixed for about 5 minutes or so (the food processor\nsays 45 seconds; the hand method says 10-15 minutes). The dough will be\nsmooth, soft, and very slightly sticky. You should be able to handle it\neasily.\n\nLet the dough rest for 30 minutes to 3 hours.\n\n\nMEAT FILLING\nWe ended up using a lot more ground spices than whole spices. This is\nthe unmodified recipe in the book; it's more complicated than the\nsimplified version we used. Substituting ground &amp; dried spices is\neasier and more portable (we pre-mixed) but you lose flavor.\n\n28g (2T) of your favorite frying fat\nbay leaf\n3 whole cloves (or equivalent amount ground)\n1 cinnamon stick\n~142g (~1c) 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n2cm piece of ginger, peeled &amp; minced\n3 medium garlic cloves, minced\n1/2T coriander seeds (no weight noted)\n1/2T cumin seeds (no weight noted)\n1/2t ground turmeric\n1T plain yogurt (we often use strained (\"Greek\") yogurt)\n1T tomato sauce (we often use paste)\n\n454g (1lb) beef, preferably chuck (85% lean, 15% fat).\n        Too lean and the mixture is dry; too rich and you'll have to drain\nout flavor.\n\n1/8t ground mace\n        we substitute allspice, even though it's not similar at all.\n        You may just wish to double the nutmeg.\n1/8t ground nutmeg, preferably fresh grated\n5g (3/4t) salt\n1/2t cayenne pepper\n        recipe calls for 1/4 to 1/2. We recommend 1/2.\n1/4c water\n\n\nWhile the dough is resting, start the filling. It will keep 3 days,\nand this makes enough to fill TWO batches of dough.\n\nHeat frying fat over medium heat until hot.\nAdd bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and cloves.\nFry until the bay leaf gets a bit dark.\n(if not using whole spices, skip this step and jump right to the onion.)\n\nLower the heat (to low), add onion, ginger and garlic; saut&eacute; &amp; stir.\nIn about 10 minutes onion will darken to medium brown.\n\nWhile this is going on: Dry-roast coriander &amp; cumin seeds over medium\nheat about 2 minutes. They should smell fragrant. Allow them to cool,\nthen grind in your spice grinder. If not using whole spices, ignore\nthis section.\n\nAdd coriander, cumin, and turmeric to onion mixture, saut&eacute; for 2\nminutes; stir constantly. Add yogurt; stir 1 minute. Add tomato sauce;\nstir &amp; cook 3 minutes.\n\nAdd meat, raise heat to medium. Saut&eacute;, break up lumps with your\nspoon/spatula/turner, until meat is browned.\n\nAdd mace, nutmeg, salt, cayenne, and water. Lower heat to lowest\npossible setting. Cover. Simmer for 45 minutes. If all the water\nevaporates, add more a small amount at a time. The mixture should be\ndry when you are done.\n\nLet filling cool, then remove the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and cloves\n(if you used whole spices. They are a pain to fish out; we tend not to\nuse whole spices for these three.)\n\n(Broam's note: also the cooking time is a bit much. We didn't let it\ngo 45 minutes; we cooked it on low until most of the water evaporated,\nthen let the mixture cool.)\n\n\n48g (1/4c) clarified butter / ghee\n        (Broam sez: You can substitute regular unsalted butter, or you can\nattempt to clarify it yourself, which is a bit labor intensive. Don't\nuse vegetable ghee, unless you're a vegan.)\n\n\nShape Dough:\nDivide dough into 8 even pieces; roll into balls. (The recipe has you\nroll into a long rope, then cut. This is not strictly necessary). Work\nwith one piece of dough at a time lest the others dry out.\n\nWith floured fingers, flowered rolling pin, and a floured surface,\nflatten the balls of dough and roll into a 12cm (5\") circle. Flour the\ndough lightly if it sticks. Once rolled out, brush the excess flour\noff. Brush the dough lightly with clarified butter, fold over, and\nbrush again. Fold over one more time.\n\nAfter all the balls are buttered and folded, roll them out again. The\nrecipe says that you should be able to roll these into an 18cm (7\")\nround but we have never gotten our dough that stretchy.\n\nPlace 1/4c of the meat filling on top of the dough. Take another piece\nand place it on top of the first piece. Fold the edges over 1cm (1/4\")\nand press to seal in the filling.\n\nFlip the filled parathas over and use the rolling pin very gently. The\nmeat should not come through the dough.\n\n(Broam says: Do not stack the parathas when finished. They'll stick\nand it's a *nightmare* to separate them.)\n\n\nFRY The Parathas\n\nHeat large skillet over medium-low.\n\nBrush pan with remaining clarified butter.\nPlace paratha in (you can cook a few at a time if they're small), fry\nfor 90 seconds. Brush surface with butter. Flip. Fry 60 seconds.\n\nThe dough may puff up a bit but will deflate when it's removed from\nthe heat. (Broam says: ours never do. YMMV).\n\n\nSERVE the Parathas\n\nCut into 4 wedges. Keep finished parathas warm in a low oven (\"warm\"\nsetting) covered with foil while you cook the rest. (You can stack\nthem here.)\n\nCan also be eaten at room temperature. Will keep overnight.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

So thank you for recording it.\n\nIn the podcast you discussed what it might take to have audio drama become a viable paying outlet of \"content\". You seemed to focus particularly on making audio drama a first class citizen in the existing marketplaces (e.g. Amazon or iTunes). That is certainly one way to go. However, those places are just retailers, and they retail what is already popular. I don't think you can actually count on them to innovate in this space.\n\nI wonder if a better way to develop a market for audio drama is to build your audience and provide an easy way for fans to pay for content. Crowd sourcing patronage seems to be getting some traction. Patreon, for instance, provides a platform for creators to reach their fans directly and for fans to directly compensate their favorite creators. Snowdrift coop is a platform that might suitable for creative commons style work (assuming it launches successfully). \n\nIt's still a heck of a lot of hard work, but if you followed a patronage model, the the hardwork of building a fan base won't get filtered by the business models of the retailers whose interest don't necessarily align with either the creators or the fans. Additionally, a patronage model can provide a base for successful creators to make inroads into the more traditional (mainstream) marketplaces.\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It was entertaining to listen to you doing every single step and seeing you do it before my minds eye. I'd never thought about describing it in such detail, but you have a point there. Surely there are a lot of listeners just starting out with this stuff and you pick them up right at the beginning, to lead them further on.\n\nThe 3V3 are sorted out by Mike, so let me comment on the \"speaker\". It's worth noting that whenever you say speaker, you actually mean \"buzzer\". The buzzer includes already some electronics to generate the tone, so we hear the beep. With a speaker (or headphone,...) on its own, you only will hear crackling sounds the moment you close or break the circuit. Due to the low resistance of the speaker coil, there can be a high current flowing, which might damage it. So when using a speaker, please add a series resistor or capacitor. \n\nRegards,\nMichael\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I also listen at variable speed using Rockbox on my iPod fourth-gen. So I don't really need the variable speed to be built into the audio file, but I am intrigued by the silence truncation thing.

I agree about the scores, although you can get just about any public-domain scores for free in PDF format from the IMSLP website. The cool thing about these new scores is that you can get the source code and edit it. For example, near the end of the semester I grabbed the Musescore file for the fugue that I talked about in this episode and converted it to Lilypond code, then added a bunch of analytical markup in the code itself, things like text boxes, labels, and different colors for the noteheads to show where the fugue subject appeared, tell what key it had modulated to, etc. With the PDF the best that I could've done would be to scribble all over it. When you have access to the source code you can do this kind of analytical markup much more elegantly. I've also taken bits of these scores and use them to create the midi examples in my counterpoint book. Great projects all around by Kimiko Ishizaka!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Yes, doing so may ultimately increase the expected lifetime of the drive, but you're missing out on the greatest benefits of the SSD by doing so. SSDs are extremely fast for random access patterns, but for sequential operations (such as reading or writing large files) they aren't significantly faster than spinning disks. The parts of your system that perform the most random access operations are likely to be swap and /var.

I can intuitively see why it works, but want to think of how I could prove it.  One could put a start and endpoint to the maze in that case.\n\nThe traversal algorithm through a maze generated like that would probably just be a right-hand-rule variant since the walls would be a single connected component.  The purely random generation that I mentioned in the podcast does not guarantee that of course meaning the right-hand rule could just lead the mouse in a circle forever.\n\nTwo ways that immediately spring to mind for ensuring the mouse always makes it to the cheese (barring running out of energy, eaten by cat, etc..) are:\n  * scan the maze and mark the connected components and ensure that the mouse and the cheese land in the same connected component\n  * scan the maze, mark the connected components and then take pairs of independent connected components and break walls between them to connect them until the maze is a single connected component.\n\nYour generation approach produces a much more sane and generally pleasing looking maze.  I'm wondering if there's a good way to then take that and \"shake it up a little\" to allow for disconnected wall segments, and such while retaining much of the pleasingness.\n\nOf course there's another possibility:  add the notion of \"teleporters\" to the maze.  :)\n\nThanks for the insight and the algorithm.

I am considering using a pi to serve my HP LJ-2200 printer to my home network.\n\nThe DEC LN03 uses RS-232/RS-422 for the serial connection.  You should be able to use a USB-to-serial converter.  I used an LN03 with PC clones and was able to run the serial link as fast as 19200 baud.  User manual will indicate how to set serial parameters via dip switches near the data connector.\n\nI suggest verifying the print engine still works by printing a few test pages before trying to connect to a computer.  I think there is a small square white button on the back that initiates printing of a test page.\n\nIt is probably difficult now to get toner or replacement parts like feed rollers for the LN03.  When a nylon gear inside my LN03 fractured, I finally ditched that printer -- after about 20 years of use in a home office.\n\nBe aware that there are a few different LN03 models.  Mine was a rare \"image\" printer that would only accept postscript.  The model will determine what driver and settings you need to use.\n\nThe LN03 always keeps the fuser unit hot.  This is a big power consumer and harsh to the mechanics that transport paper and the photo-sensitive band.\n\nThere used to be USB to parallel converters available for purchase.

If this gas cools it just becomes liquid water again. When you let boiled water cool down to drinking temperature it has a peculiar flat taste, which I think is because it has less dissolved air than fresh water from a mountain stream.

Both the UK and the USA variants of English have been evolving in their own directions for hundreds of years. Spelling gelled in Britain earlier than in the US but the French variants became popular on this side of the Atlantic. Thus cheque/check with the French spelling being ch&egrave;que. There's a tendency for both \"sides\" to tell the other they're wrong. I try to resist this personally.\n\nThanks for the explanation of \"duplex check\". I don't think anything like this has existed here. We simply note things like the date, payee and amount on a stub which remains in the cheque book after the cheque has been torn out, and tally them up from there.\n\nIn my case I use electronic transfer for almost everything these days.

Yes, I think the definition of 'fountain pen' extends to cartridge pens.

Thing is, fountain pens really need to sit in individual spaces so they don't rattle together. That's what my cheapo leather case does, each pen has its own elastic loop. I know that this verges on the obsessional, but after spending &pound;100+ (or possibly a lot more) on a writing implement you'd want it to stay in pristine condition.\n\nYes, 'fetish' is the word I was trying to avoid!

Disassembling them and leaving them to soak in warm water with a tiny drop of dish soap is the recommended way to loosen the dried ink.

I still have it and am just in the process of resurrecting it.\n\nThere are various opinions about \"wet\" pens (I've heard them described as \"juicy\" too). A broad nib needs plenty of ink to be delivered because it deposits more. Finer nibs conversely need less. However, much lower-quality paper doesn't suit wetter pens as the ink tends to sink in and \"feather\" or bleed through. On the other hand, a drier pen can be frustrating as the ink feed often doesn't keep up with the writing. Many factors to consider!\n\nI'm glad you're enjoying the Metro. I'd love to see the Sheaffer - we need a show on your experiences :-)\n\nAnother aspect of fountain pen usage you might enjoy is the huge selection of inks that is available.

It was fine for a while but then after a time, the shows were not been released as often. This is why there are only 2308 shows rather than the 3780 shows you say there should be. Around October 2010 there were a few months with very little activity, and people were saying that HPR had podfaded. \n\nI suggested we should either end HPR or continue it.\nhttps://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2010-September/007639.html\nThis was prompted by a lostnbronx show \"hpr0560 :: Old soldiers\", which was an essay about how to gracefully end a podcast. \nhttps://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0560\n\nFollowing discussions the promise was made that we would continue as a community podcast. So that when the community decides it's time to finish the project, we play all the shows we have and close it down with grace and dignity.\n\nThis is why we have the text on each and every podcast. \"We are a Community podcast network that releases shows every weekday Monday through Friday. Today's show, like all our shows, was contributed by a HPR listener like yourself.\" \nhttps://hackerpublicradio.org/theme.php\n\nSo no shows - no HPR.

However, these are being sold as suitable for the Pi 3, though I imagine this is more to do with the size. Seems odd though.\n\nThe Pibow cases are made of quite thin acrylic - 2.8mm thick according to my digital callipers. Some layers have quite narrow pieces which wrap around items on the board like the USB connectors. Also you have to remove a protective film from each layer, which can put strain on these narrow parts as you peel it off. I have nearly snapped them on occasion, but the trick is to be slow and steady as you peel and support the weaker pieces. Once assembled the layers above and below keep everything nice and firm I find.\n\nHi JWP!\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with Nano, it's simple to use and does the job. I used Pico (on a VAX Cluster running VMS where it was the editor for the Pine mail client) for many years. However, it was a tremendous relief to move away to a more powerful editor like EDT and TPU on the VAX, then Emacs and Vi/Vim on Unix.\n\nFinding myself presented with Nano is a shock when my fingers and brain are trying to operate in Vim mode, so I want to install Vim as soon as I can - preferably with my own .vimrc and all the plugins I normally use!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Very simple, very reliable.\n\nI'm not sure I followed the rationale for booting from the attached SSD, given that you still have to have a microSD card in the Pi.\n\nWhichever way you connect, a Pi + SSD is a great low-cost server solution.

I used '%s' because I'll be using the prompt string as a format definition for printf, and '%s' means \"substitute a string of arbitrary length here\".\n\nThe use of printf to write the prompt string allows  the format to be defined when calling the function. The way it's laid out is:\n\nprintf -v prompt \"$prompt\" \"[Y/n]\" \n\nbecause the '-v prompt' saves the result in variable 'prompt' (rewrites it).\nThe  \"$prompt\" is the format string like when you do:\n\nprintf \"The answer is %d\\n\" 42\n\ngiving:\n\nThe answer is 42\n\nIn this case however, the text to be substituted for '%s' is \"[Y/n]\".\n\nNone of this would work with:\n\nprompt=\"${prompt} [Y/n]\"\n\nIn my example function call above you'd get 'prompt' containing:\n\n\"Do you want to continue? %s  [Y/n]\"\n\nNo substitution would happen.\n\nOf course you could redesign the function to simply append the \"[Y/n]\" to the prompt in the way you did.

I'm sharing the awk series with b-yeezi this time since we're both keen to talk about it.\n\nYou'll have noticed that I like writing long detailed notes. I got into the habit of writing explanations of things when I started working in IT and kept a journal of stuff I'd learnt. It probably followed on from my science education where we were encouraged to keep a lab book of what we'd observed.\n\nSoon after I started running an adult evening class in Pascal, and wrote a series of handouts for my students that grew into a textbook at the end of the course. It was intended as a resource that they could refer to and learn from outside the classes.\n\nThe workflow I use to generate show notes (producing HTML from Markdown) allows me to turn on an ePub generation stage. I tried it out for some HPR episodes but wasn't happy with the results. I could look at improving this if anyone is interested and could recreate ePub format notes for the sed series for example. It's not a textbook as such but should be a comprehensive set of notes about the episodes that could be read on a PC or tablet.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

However, I still don't want to call it a \"German word\". It is an English word, or derived from it, that is used by Germans. There is the matching word \"Projektor\" in German, just no one is using it to reference to a data projector. \nAlas, it is so common these days to call things by, what some people think might be, the English term for it.

If nobody is online at the moment, your message will be lost in cyberspace, and you may or may not be told that this happened.\n2. If you have several clients online, they have priorities set to determine which client should get the messages delivered to it.\n\nSo what these XEPs do is that they add the ability to:\n\n1. Store-and-forward, so that the server holds any incoming messages, and delivers them when you get back online.\n\n2. Carbon-copy, which means that all clients currently connected will get any incoming messages, rather than just one of the clients.\n\n3. Message storage, which I'm not sure how it's handled, but I suppose the server can back-fill a connecting client so that any messages received since last time will be sent to it, even if other clients have already received those messages.\n\nI'm just inferring this from comments and from the titles of the extensions, I haven't actually used them.\n\nNow, talking about \"naked XMPP\" is probably not fair, because these extensions are supported by several XMPP servers, including the original ejabberd project and the rather popular Prosody project.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I don't want to spend too much time going into it, but in general, I don't agree with the notion that just because the you can't expect to have total privacy on the internet, and that so many companies ask for so much of your information, that we as consumers should just throw our hands up in mercy and say \"take it all\".\n\nWe should be able to make informed decisions about exactly what and with whom information is shared. Many people, myself included, don't necessarily disagree with sharing some of this data, but huge EULA's and Privacy Agreements that Google and the like create make the transaction of information for services almost impossible to understand. Also, the closed source nature of their products do not allow users or experts the ability to validate the claims made in the aforementioned agreements. \n\nIn summary, I do not object to Google or any other company making the consumer the product. I just wish they were more forthcoming with their business practices, and therefore am selective on which services I choose to use.\n\nIt does make a thought-provoking conversation, so thanks for that!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Well, there is always Doppler shift on the uplink and downlink frequencies. Up and down are separated by using different frequency bands of 2m (VHF,145MHz) and 70cm (UHF,435MHz). As Doppler shift scales with frequency, it is obvious that the effect is thrice as severe on the 70cm frequency as opposed to 2m. Amsat Oscar 85 (AO-85) has a U/V transponder, which means the transmit direction towards the satellite is on UHF and thus experiences the greater Doppler shift. Some other satellites have V/U transponders, where the bigger shift effect will be seen on the output of the satellite. \n\nAnother entry for the list of things to explain, in a separate show or the amateur round table: \"What is this Doppler shift all about?\" The best way to demonstrate it would probably be a recording of the telegraphy telemetry beacon, many of the birds have, where you can easily hear the pitch of the tone changing while the satellite passes.\n\nBTW, I was not even aware that there was an AO-85... I have to keep more updated on this. :-)\n\nRegards,\nMichael","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Also a bit of experience making a couple of database-backed web sites.\n\nI like the idea of the third design of tags.\n\nI would also change the HPR episode intake process to make any new tags in the new format - have a cutover date/time after which all the new entries in the database use the new tagging scheme (populate the new tags tables and not the old tags fields.  In fact, even remove the old tags fields to avoid confusion about which set of tags is the \"right\" set).

You could keep a copy of the old site (and update it) for a while until confident the new site works properly.\n\nI don't know how the HPR web site is served, I got the impression from your series that it is static pages generated from a DB.  Perhaps you generate a new set of pages when a new episode is added to the DB.

That way the ideas are all fresh in my mind. I use the notes as a structure but mostly ad-lib the audio. Reading the notes is a big mistake as far as I am concerned. Since the first HPR show I did I do not rehearse.\n\nYears ago (late 1970's) I used to teach evening classes in an Adult Education centre (Pascal, BASIC). I evolved a similar style there, and constructed notes which became hand-outs for the students. Amusingly they were printed on a line-printer, and I'd written my own text-processor to generate them (think early but less convenient Markdown).\n\nAs to audio editing, I do edit. I hesitate and 'um' and 'er' a lot and I deal with these by (light) silence truncation and removal of a proportion of 'um/er' patterns. I can edit a lot faster now than when I started, but it's just a personal foible.

I may have said this at some point, but maybe not: I was primarily using it to demonstrate how expansion was working. I don't use it in that way to view directory contents and so forth.\n\nExpansions like the ones here are used in many contexts, as you know. Back in my early days of using Unix (we had Sun, HP, DEC, Silicon Graphics and Apollo systems around at various times at the university I worked at), with a variety of shells. I think As an aside, I hated csh and tcsh the most!\n\nThere were time when I'd type something like:\n\nrm *.msg\n\nand get back an error like \"too many files\". That was because the expansion of '*.msg' resulted in 'rm' getting maybe thousands of file names, which it couldn't cope with. I got in the habit of doing stuff like:\n\necho *.msg | wc -w\n\nto warn me of such potential problems. Maybe even 'echo' would fail sometimes with \"too many files\" (or similar), but I don't remember now. Maybe 'ls' would have been a better choice back then. However, for this series I felt it \"got in the way\" a bit more, as it were :-)\n\nYour points about printf are well taken. I did mention it earlier in this series, and showed its use in various contexts. However, it probably deserves a show all of its own!\n\nYes, I had discovered:\n\n$ printf \"%s\\n\" *.msg\n\na while back and was surprised it printed out its arguments one per line. Some other 'printf' implementations reject such things because there are more arguments than format specifiers. The Bash 'printf' behaviour is better in my opinion.\n\nBetter stop - Ken will accuse me of wasting another show opportunity!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Secondly I find that I need to change the screen background colour and font to be able to read the coloured text. Admittedly, this might be my eyes, but if a filename is basically a blur I don't get a lot from the feature! (I have similar problems with other commands that generate coloured output, so I don't blame 'exa'.)\n\nPotentially the Git interface is useful, though I don't know what the symbols mean. The whole thing needs documentation - ideally in the form of a well-structured manpage. Also I was puzzled to find that:\n\nexa -l --git db_*\n\ndidn't show the Git details for the matching files. These are only shown when there's no file argument.\n\nMy final nit-pick is that my favourite 'ls -ltr' can't be written so simply in 'exa'. The equivalent seems to be:\n\nexa -ls modified\n\nI'd like to see a way of setting defaults (like sort by modification time), through an environment variable or a configuration file. As Jon says, using aliases would also be a solution.\n\nI shall be intrigued to see how 'exa' develops. It does have promise.

I was confused by the fact that Magnatune offer commercial licenses by subscription (see https://magnatune.com/info/licensing) but the license for non-commercial use is Creative Commons by-nc-sa, which I now understand is perpetual.\n\nThe subscription model has changed. In the very earliest days there were several, and you could buy individual albums, including on CD (I have a few). I think a monthly \"all you can eat\" subscription followed that: I was a monthly subscriber for many years. Finally, about 5 years ago they changed to only offering a lifetime subscription. I imagine this significantly reduced their overheads.\n\nThere's a blog where their business model has been discussed, for example: https://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2010/03/new-business-model-for-magnatune.html","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Exercise isn't a weight loss tool per se, it's excellent for health and is probably the best single thing that you can do other than stopping smoking to improve your health.

  {"id":2101,"eps_id":2361,"comment_timestamp":"2017-08-23 14:00:37","comment_author_name":"ClaudioM","comment_title":"Fantastic!","comment_text":"What a fantastic episode!  I found myself nodding my head so many times during this episode on what was said about exercise and weight loss.  I started my journey into fitness after so many years of not exercising and failing to keep it up after attempting to do so.  Initially, you have to start with a change in your state of mind.  I began to look at fitness as a long-term process of milestones, not as a means to an end or a \"goal\" in a determined period of time.  Once I did this, making it a routine was a lot easier for me to keep up.  I started with \"baby steps,\" doing 20-30 minutes of simple calisthenics.  After some time where I felt comfortable performing those exercises, I would push myself a little more each time, eventually increasing my workouts and the intensity.  While I didn't focus too much on the scale, I gradually noticed I was losing weight when I did weigh myself.  If I didn't lose weight that day, I wasn't disheartened because I had already set my mind that this was a long-term process and that I would lose it eventually, and I did.\n\nYou also need to think that you are doing this for _you_ and not for anyone else or any particular reason that isn't for you.  A better, healthier _you_ needs to be your motivation.  Once I started thinking this way as well, it gave me the enthusiasm to keep on going.\n\nI also changed my eating habits over time.  I found some information online stating that one should focus on eating foods with \"simple\" ingredients, meaning that it should be as unprocessed as possible.  The less ingredients shown, the quicker the body can process it and use it.  The more ingredients listed, the longer it takes and, depending on your intake, can end up being stored as fat.  Using this as a guideline, I moved away from a lot of the processed stuff to more natural foods, especially vegetables which I already loved but wasn't eating enough of.  If it had to come in a box, I made sure that it had as little ingredients listed as possible.  Sometimes, I'll eat wheat bran flakes or Honey Bunches of Oats, the former having less ingredients than the latter.  While both have less ingredients than other popular cereals on the market, I always choose simple oatmeal with some cinnamon and honey.  I also have eggs with spinach for breakfast, and sometimes even for dinner (this is my favorite plate thus far).  As far as sweets, I am taking in less sugar now than I used to.  I still have my coffee with cream and sugar at times (and very little at that), but I'm also drinking it black more than before.  All of these changes along with my exercise routine have worked together to aid in my weight loss.\n\nI have been taking vitamin supplements but really it's just a simple multivitamin daily that you can get at any store.  It has helped boost my immune system and given my body the nutrients needed that I may not be getting naturally with my food intake.  I have added a couple of others that aren't included in the multivitamin supplement but only because I don't get enough of them from the foods I eat.  Remember, as the name implies, they are to _supplement_ what nutrients you are taking in daily (in other words, what you're not getting because of allergies/reactions to certain foods or availability of those foods).  It's also important to talk to your doctor and get informed on what you can and can't (or shouldn't) take when it comes to supplements.  In certain instances, certain vitamins/minerals can actually be harmful in large quantities.\n\nhttps://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/bodybuilding-mom-dies-from-too-much-protein-and-urea-cycle-disorder\nhttps://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/supplements-that-work-and-ones-you-should-skip\nhttps://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/best-foods-for-natural-health\n\nRegarding Ken's comment about weight gain and eating more, this is true but it needs to be taken in context.  As you continue training and working out, you are building muscle mass as you burn fat even though it's not visually noticeable.  This will affect what you see on the scale depending on your progress.  If you are weight-training or doing any high-intensity workout, you will notice that your appetite increases over time (this happened to me as well) and you may find yourself hungry after a workout even if you've eaten prior.  This is normal because your body needs to replenish itself accordingly during the recovery process after such workouts.  The key here is to eat foods that are as healthy as they can be with as little processing as possible.  Carbs and protein provide energy before and after intense workouts, but they have to be healthy carbs and protein.  Fats are also good, but they must be \"healthy\" fats (unsalted roasted peanuts, avocados, etc.) and _in_moderation_.  While the video covers this near the end, it does so poorly in my opinion in ways that can be easily refuted as mentioned above and some of the examples given leave a lot to be desired.  Then again, 5 minutes can't cover everything.\n\nUltimately, this is what has worked for me and it was an \"evolutionary\" process in my fitness journey.  Everyone's different and every strategy will be different, but the core mentality and process is pretty much the same.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

That was around 2014. I believe they have got a little bit cheaper since then but they remain a \"last resort\" option for all but the deepest pockets.\n\nHi Frank\n\nI can only speak from my own experience. Since the system was installed we've had winds of > 70 mph, thick fogs, thunder and no shortage of heavy rain, but the connection has been unaffected as far as I can determine. \n\nThe network nodes all transmit with a multiple of the minimum power theoretically required to provide the service. That enables the signal to \"blast through\" bad weather. \n\nPerhaps where your brother lives there is a greater distance between the nodes which weakens the received signal.\n\nI've just returned from Spain where I noted large numbers of internet service transceivers mounted on houses and apartments. I've since discovered that outside urban areas it is pretty much the default delivery method.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

For example it common practice in European hospitals to run expensive equipment like MRI machines 24/7 to reduce the overall cost. \n\nIt is also possible to increase human utilization by concentrating skills in facilities dedicated to a given specialism. This is been done to great efficiency in India and there are facilities dedicated to, for example eye surgery, or heart treatments. This has proven to be extremely useful in attracting the best specialists from all over the world, because they are guaranteed to have a high throughput of patients in their dedicated field. This allows the facilities to train up many more specialists as there is a constant utilization of their skills.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

College Course Numbering","comment_text":"Regarding \"101,\" 102,\" etc.\n\nIt is common, but by no means universal that U. S. colleges use this means of numbering courses.  Generally, 100 refers to Freshman (first year) courses; 200 to Sophomore (second-year) level courses, up to 400 and above for advanced or graduate-level courses.   Generally, the more advanced the course, the more narrow and in-depth its focus.\n\n\"101\" is usually a basic intro course, \"102\" the  next intro course, and so on.  A first semester U. S. History course would be History 101 (say, colonization to Civil War); the following second semester course would be History 102 (say, Civil War to Present).  (As an aside, judging by what's happening domestically in my country, I have concluded that those courses are no longer taught, but that's another matter).   History 412, just to pick a random topic, might be an exhaustive dive into the Early Federal period (roughly 1790-1832).\n\nAgain, this is not a universal system, jut a very common, perhaps the most common system.\n\nI do not know the origins of this system.\n\nHere's a more detailed article from Cal State--Northridge:  https://catalog.csun.edu/policies/course-numbering-system/","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Much of what you all said about the status of women before prohibition was reflective of this.  I'm old and I can remember when, in the USA, a woman could not get a loan, a mortgage, or a credit card without a male cosigner, if she could get one at all.\n\nAnd, as we can see from current history, many men still view women as property, indeed, as playthings.\n\nIn addition, as a lifelong reader of Playboy (and at the risk of starting something), I must, with some trepidation, question how   Playboy pictures can be conflated with pornography, unless the conflator believes that nudity is inherently pornographic, a position I do not share.  I would argue that said person, at the least, has never seen a copy of Hustler. nor an image of the Venus de Milo.  \n\nWhy for that matter, do you think the great masters of painting have painted so many nudes?  I guarantee--as Justin Wilson used to say--it wasn't solely because of an abstract appreciation of color and form.\n\nOnce more, an excellent discussion.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.\n\nOpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.\n\nOpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. Autocad DXF files can be used as the data exchange format for such 2D outlines. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

However, as I understand it, considering OpenSCAD an alternative to things like Fusion 360 and SolidWorks and others, is a bit tough. The open source world also has Blender, with which you can do 3D modeling too. But again, as I understand it, the way these options work is a lot different and they lack many of the features present in the commercial products.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there are a few 3D modeling options out there that are not open source, but do work with Linux due to the fact that they are cloud/web based. OnShape.com comes to mind.\n\nSo, while there are alternatives, sort of, Fusion 360 seems to be becoming the software of choice in \"Maker\" circles.\n\nI am a beginner at this, so these are mostly just my perceptions.

It took a lot of time to find the music, and Klaatu assisted with offering up some content for it also.  I found that it was really time consuming, and Terry F took over for a period of time until it fizzled out. \n\nThe main idea that I had was to get more OGG content out there, to help expand the awareness of the OGG format, due to restrictions of the MP3 format, and that many MP3 Players didn't support it.  - Today, most people are listening to content on computers or Android devices, most are able to listen to the ogg format, if they wish. \n\nIf my ol' memory serves right, even Mark Shuttleworth has stopped worrying about the MP3 format being a real problem, even tho' it's still a closed file format. Granted it's not open, but the threat of being sued doesn't seem likely after nothing happening after all of this time. \n\n- FWIW, when I AM online I'm easily found over on G+  aka randynose.com  Also over on Mastodon.Rocks @randynose. \n\nThanks for reminding me of some good times years ago...  \n\nAll hail the Juiced Penguin.   :)","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Possibly because I was a bad student at school in my teens, I have never properly understood the whole issue of grammar, parsing sentences, past participles and all of that. However, I have always had a fascination with words, their meanings and their origins, and I think it's English that has led to that interest.\n\nOther languages also have their problems. I learnt French at school (and did a few years as an adult too) and never got to grips with the genders of nouns. Why is a table (furniture) feminine for example? How is it possible to remember them all? I still enjoy attempting to speak French nevertheless.\n\nYou point to the deficiencies of English with regard to the meaning of \"free\". Absolutely. That's a shortcoming. However, many other languages have their own idiosyncrasies. I worked at a university with a campus in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Bahasa Melayu, the local language, has a very different grammar compared to English. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_grammar for some aspects of it. I remember having conversations with Malay speakers, suggesting a English way of expressing a thing, to be told that that was pretty much impossible in their language. This led me to believe that English might be more subtle; though perhaps on the other hand it's more suitable for circumlocution, evasion and indirectness!\n\nAt school my French teacher was also an advocate of Esperanto. I wonder if that sort of language was what you had in mind instead of English? I don't know enough about its benefits to judge, but I wonder if a constructed language can really be as rich as a \"natural\" evolved language - even with all of its clutter and detritus.\n\nThanks for your comments - they really got me thinking.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

By applying this to the contents of a document library the database was used to populate a \"search by keyword\" system for that library.\n\nPopulating the database from several hundred Word and PDF documents took only a couple of minutes.

It's unwise to feed a 'while' loop thorough a pipe because the 'while' runs\nin a separate shell which can lead to problems\n\n2. Never use 'ls' to get a list of files for consumption in a script. Unless\nyou can be completely sure that the 'ls' you are using isn't adding suffixes\nlike '@' for links, and '/' for directories and isn't adding colour codes to\nthe names, don't do it. Much better to use 'find'.\n\nMy test with this pipeline returned colour codes which 'ffmpeg' didn't like,\nand it failed that way.\n\nfor i in *.mp3;do ffmpeg -i \"${i}\" \"${i}.wav\" 2&gt;&amp;1;done\n\nThis doesn't use 'ls' it simply uses file expansion therefore no additional\nfilename garbage!\n\nDid I mention: don't use 'ls' as a way of feeding filenames to a loop or\nwhatever?\n\nThe first example would have worked if you'd written:\n\nwhile read i;do ffmpeg -i \"${i}\" \"${i}.wav\" 2&gt;&amp;1;done &lt; &lt;(find . -maxdepth 1 -name \"*.mp3\")\n\nThe '-maxdepth 1' option prevents 'find' from going into sub-directories. The\n'find' is inside a process substitution which is redirected to the 'while' so\nthe 'read' inside it can obtain what is produced on its STDIN channel.\n\nAlso, if it had been me I'd have written:\n\nffmpeg -i \"${i}\" \"${i}.wav\"\n\nas:\n\nffmpeg -i \"${i}\" \"${i%mp3}wav\"\n\nto avoid the output files being called 'xxx.mp3.wav'.

I always wonder how other people make similar things I like. \nAs it happens, I just made crepes yesterday. \nI have no idea why my Texas mom started making crepes, but I just remember having them at home as a kid. \nI don't know if what I do is technically called a crepe but it's very crepe like, or maybe more super thin pancake like. \nI'm not much of a measurer. I typically start with 1 to 1.5 cups flour and add a couple table spoons to 1/4 cup of sugar depending on the day. I also add lots of cinnamon. 1/4 teaspoon to a half table spoon. Again depending on the amount of flour, the sugar and cinnamon increases. \nThis is basically a dessert crepe.\nAfter whisking the dry together with a 1/8 teaspoon of salt or or less, I add 3/4 cup of milk. If the mix isn't watery enough, add more milk until pretty thin. Then add an egg and beat in completely. \nI have a gas stove, so I put the flame on to just above as low as it can go without going out. I let that heat a stainless pan for several minutes, while putting the other things together. More flame if you know what you're doing. You want the pan to be the right temp before putting in the first drizzle of batter. \nI like to use a cake decorating bottle to put the batter in the pan. Get the bottles at Ross, a discount store, or at the dreaded Wal-Mart. You could probably enlarge the opening on one of the $.99 ketchup/mustard squeeze bottles, but they are not clear like the decorating bottles. \n\nJust before putting the batter in the pan, swirl around then end of a stick of butter just enough to wet the pan. Start at the center of the pan with a splash of batter making an ever widening circle until you cover 2/3 of the pan. If the batter is thin enough it will spread itself. Otherwise you can pick up and jostle the pan to flatten more. I generally cook until the edges curl and the top starts looking less wet, then flip and cook the other side 10-20 seconds to firm up top side.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I'd like to offer a different view. There is lots wrong with capitalism. First thing is that capitalists believe their system is the only answer. The hangover after our last industrial revolution gave us shorter working days, safety rules and employee rights at work. Currently there is lots of demand out there for sabbaticals or people taking a break. so hell yeah, give me a robot who does my job so I can recover from stress, spend time with my children or travel, do volunteer work. Why do we doubt Basic income? currently those breaks are only available for the rich or singles or childless. Have you seen a happy cashier? Have you heard a mine worker  shouting: yes - let's continue ruining my lung instead of giving me proper training so I can work in a solar panel farm. and for the doctors! I have met so many who were an utter waste of my time. yes, give me the Watson system. I had to retrain in my job 3 times over the last 6 years. it has been hard. it doesn't have to be! As you say, Robots give us an opportunity to focus on the things that matter in life. We dont have to run anymore all the time. Robots guarantee a basic level of productivity. We can find better and creative solutions to provide proper pay for people who work in the care. We can focus on figuring out why our society still struggles with all kinds of abuse, why we do not trust anyone, why we feel the need to destroy our beautiful world. we have a universe to explore and the complex systems in our world. and if there is the odd person not willing to work, then that's okay too. People have reasons! Capitalists only know the word more. When will you read all the books that keep accumulating on your bookshelf because you shouted MORE.

Tangential to the main topic, I was intrigued to learn you are paid cryptocurrency.  You did not mention which type, but given the volatility in the better known cryptocurrencies, I&rsquo;m curious how that might effect one&rsquo;s income.  I&rsquo;m sending this to your e-mail referenced on the HPR website, but I&rsquo;m also posting these questions to the show comments, so any listener who gets paid in cryptocurrency can weigh in.  I&rsquo;d rather hear from community members whom a significant portion of their income comes in the form of cryptocurrency, but maybe someone who makes extra money from a hobby or side project can contribute their tales of fortunes won and lost.  At this time, I&rsquo;m not asking for stories from miners or people who lost their stash do to alleged  malfeasance (i.e., Mt. Gox).\n\n1.  You said you were paid in cryptocurrency.  Is this in the form of you get the equivalent of X Euros (replace with relevant national currency) a week based on the current exchange rate or is it fixed at Y units of cryptocurrency?\n2. If the latter answer to #1, what happens if the bottom drops out of said cryptocurrency?  Are you under contract, stuck working for nothing?  I guess the corollary would be what happens when cryptocurrency goes so high the company can&rsquo;t afford to pay you?\n3. Has volatility in the cryptocurrency market effected your financial status.  In other words, have you ever made plans based on a sudden uptick in your cryptocurrency savings, only to have them dashed when the bubble burst?\n\nAlmost a year ago, my non-techie friends started asking me about Bitcoin.  By that time, Bitcoin was in it&rsquo;s first stages of it&rsquo;s upwards ramp.  I really hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention, but suddenly Bitcoin was all over the news as this magical money tree that no-one knew existed.

I did some basic repairs on the player, and learnt to solder when the leads and plugs needed fixing.

With books, you have the physical sensation of a paper book...The smell of the book, the feel of flipping pages. Meanwhile, with music, not only do you have the spinning tape reels and the movement of the tonearm, but more than that, analog music has more depth and richness, and is generally a warmer ambience than digital music.

PCs would originally boot off the floppy drive, which was always A, and for convenience, a second floppy drive was often added and it was always B. So the hard drives started with C.

You said that you can't write documents or make presentation on Linux and that is a perfectly valid reason for __you__ to dump the linux desktop.

I do not want that responsibility.&rdquo;\n\nMy two questions are, 1) What exactly is the nature of the two remaining clips whose inclusion is problematic? and 2) what would &ldquo;being held responsible&rdquo; mean in practical terms?\n\nOn the first point, how long are the clips and what are they of? Music? Broadcast footage? Do the clips comprise the entire original work or do they amount to a minor quotation?\n\nIn the US, Fair Use is an actual legal limitation of creators' rights under copyright law. The US also has the DMCA, which effectively allows providers to host anything, and if a copyright holder has a problem with their stuff being included somewhere they can file a takedown notice and the provider handles it by simply removing the content in question. But this is not the case in other countries, particularly the EU where there has been a lot of, shall we say, new development in this area recently.\n\nIf the answer to (1) is \"the two clips are actually entire Beatles songs\"&hellip;then there isn&rsquo;t really a legal defense no matter what jurisdiction we're talking about.\n\nBut even if the answer to (1) is \"They are fifteen-second excerpts from an hour-long lecture given at a public university\", &hellip;If the answer to (2) is \"we don't/can't know so we are acting out of an abundance of caution\" I can respect that.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I don't think either of them have a need of, or have any experience using accessibility tools. Would we even be able to trust their assessment given that their inability to use them could simply be down to not knowing which key to use to enable support.

For example Regolith Linux uses the i3 window manager, which is a dead loss for accessibility.\n\nSome distros are a disgrace, like the interview Ken gave with the lead developer of Mint a couple of years ago when the dev declared \"we're not interested in accessibility.\"\n\nBut just take thirty seconds or so to answer a11y fundamentals.\n\nIt is very annoying when so many distros are Debian or Ubuntu derivatives, but have stripped out the speech from the installer","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

This one was great!\n\nAs to your reflection on the pronunciation of the word \"solder\" I have a few remarks:\n\n- The word is derived from the Latin \"solidare\" - to make solid\n\n- Yes, the British do generally pronounce it to rhyme with \"colder\" and \"folder\". This seems to make sense given that its form is very similar. Pronouncing \"folder\" as \"fodder\", even in dialect, would be very confusing, for example.\n\n- The French equivalent is \"souder\", which sounds (to my ears) like \"sooday\".\n\n- I have seen it suggested that the USA pronunciation is derived from the French.\n\nLanguage is fun!

Assume, the original track contains tones in the 10 kHz range, these become 40kHz tones in the sped up version. When playing the quick version to record them on tape, the player has to correctly reproduce those high pitched tones and the recorder has to be able to bring those to tape. Depending on the frequency response of this chain, I expect this to be the bottle neck. When playing at quarter speed, the highest pitch you will get is only a fourth of the highest frequency the recorder could handle.\n\nRegards,\nMichael","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

So to say that I don't know what tools are available is perhaps a little unfair as I did state in the episode that I'm limiting myself to busybox builtins.  Imposing that limitation on myself is perhaps a little silly, but, it is a fact that I would have to install _something_ to get the additional functionality you reference, and that may not always be possible or desirable in embedded applications.\n\nActually, I wrote the above so I'll leave it there, but I decided to double check.  I usually refer to https://busybox.net/BusyBox.html as a single page reference to the builtins and shuf isn't listed but /usr/bin/shuf is indeed a symlink to /bin/busybox on one of my Alpine devices, which is a little annoying.  When I work on a script like this one, I usually do it on my laptop that has all the full tools on it but I double check against the busybox page to make sure I'm not using a command or an option to a command that busybox doesn't support.

If one is not supremely carefully, ie: wash thoroughly ( more than a minute) and then sanitize, you can spread Hep A to your self and your loved ones very easily. \n\nFortunately, Hep A is not fatal, mostly just uncomfortable, with a mild fever that passes and diarrhea for up to 30 days or so.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I took him to mean that this particular episode had helped to provide an insight which assisted with his understanding.\n\nIn my reply I pointed to the series that b-yeezi and I had done on awk where we'd tried to introduce people to this tool and had made many many references to the gawk manual along the way of course.\n\nThere is no contest with the gawk manual itself, if that is what you were implying. The manual is obviously the most comprehensive and definitive resource on the utility and the language. The resource which b-yeezi and I had tried to provide was simply a way into concepts which may have been daunting and somewhat inaccessible to some.\n\nOur role was one of supplementing the manual itself, not of superseding it in any way.\n\nI hope this clarifies any misunderstanding there may have been.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

The only consumer hardware I know of that supports anything close to physical write protection is the CD-ROM, and even most CD-ROM drives keep their firmware on a writable flash chip. \n\nMost of these are advanced attacks that average person will ever have to worry about, but worth keeping in mind.

I have no problem with anyone else choosing to have them though, and in some cases I admire the choices they have made.\n\nI have never voiced this opinion to my kids (as far as I know), but neither of them were keen on the idea of having tattoos when I asked!

There are no definitive statements from anyone on Covid-19.  As you've pointed out, they've already proved some of the statements made about some of the treatments being talked about have been proven to be wrong and biased.  \n\nPart of the blame lies in their bad record keeping.  Hospitals will make an automatic $12,000 for every Covid-19 patient they log into the system.  And therefore, just everybody had Covid-19 damage, even in you had terminal cancer or were hospice before the entire thing started,,, they file you as a Covid-19 death.\n\nGreat Britain has recently admitted they have discovered the same thing happened over there and thus their statistics and record keeping have been skewed badly.  \n\nWe do not know for sure that 200,000 Americans have in fact died from Covid-19 this year so far.  The data on deaths recorded every year in the United States has varied so widely over the past 50 years, it's truthfully uncertain who many we could attribute toward Covid-19.   \n\nMore on next buffer.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I mostly use MyTinyToDo list (see hpr1899 :: MyTinyTodo List), which I have installed on my virtual private server and can access from any web browser.

Really enjoyed your show. \n\nIf you look at the representation of the black community in the wider community of Linux/FLOSS then I think you are definitely on to something. However, there are a great number of non-white contributors to FLOSS projects all over the world - particularly on the Indian sub-continent. It would, I think, be a shame if anybody new to Linux and FLOSS felt there may be any kind of bias against, or any favour of, any racial group - not that I think you were suggesting that there is.\n\nBecause communication between contributors on projects often takes place using text-based messaging, for the most part we probably have no idea what the people we correspond with look like, or are like as people. Everyone is as good as their contributions, which is just as it should be.\n\nYou made the point that if you had not told the listeners of your racial background nobody would likely have known from your voice or accent. Absolutely right, so it's entirely possible that could be the case with a number of other HPR contributors.\n\nWomen, though, have far more distinctive voices so I think it's indisputable that of 3000+ HPR shows, the number submitted by women is pitiful. Diversity takes many forms, so I think there is at least as big an issue with gender diversity in Linux/FLOSS as there is in ethnicity.\n\nTo think in terms of a diversity \"problem\" hints at there being conscious efforts to attract or exclude certain groups. I honestly don't think that is the case in the Linux/FLOSS world, but there can be no doubt that broadening its appeal as widely as possible across society can only bring benefits at every level.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It sounds as though you've done quite well for yourself and you have a strong community around that cares about you getting ahead in life.  That's awesome and we all need something like this in our lives.\n\nThanks for sharing your back story about you and your family.  I do appreciate someone talking about something else other their newest laptop, or the latest distro of their favorite operating system.\n\nThis is a podcast and like most podcasts there's lots of rambling and lots of pundits.\n\nI think you are making some broad generalizations about People Of Color (POC) in America -- even though you are a member of that community.  I know you stated - this is from your experience.\n\nFor instance, you state you feel the reason that POC are not vocal in the Floss community is because they're somehow afraid. I don't believe this at all.\n\nI think many POC are unaware of many FLOSS technological tools...but so are lots of other people who are not black, brown, or women.  Being ignorant or unaware of something does NOT make you afraid !\n\nI'm sure your family was apprehensive of being part of that Great Migration; but they did it!  So did millions of other African Americans. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29\n\nPOC consume a lot of technical information just like any other folks in America. They use computers, cell phones tablets...etc. Additionally, they spend lots of money on tech related items. \nTech companies want POC communities (all communities for that matter) to consume their products. They have no interest in these communities participating in its implementation.\n\nFor instance, Are we to believe that Apple couldn't hire a POC as part of their QA team for their watches ??\nhttps://thegrio.com/2015/05/01/apple-watch-dark-skin/","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

These days, the Windows license key (at least the OEM ones, meaning those that are imposed on you when you buy hardware) is usually tied to the hardware, i.e. the BIOS or whatever chip. I don&rsquo;t think It will be accepted inside a VM.\n\nYour best use for the drive would be to pop it into an external case and use it as mobile storage or as a backup drive. (Or leave it bare if you have a hot-swap adapter) That&rsquo;s what I did with the HDD that came in my Thinkpad. When that arrived 5 years ago, I only did a short boot-up because I was curious about Windows 10. So I had my first (and for many years only) contact with that.

This means you can apply different policies on say /bin/sh depending on the chain of execution leading to it (kernel -&gt; init -&gt; getty -&gt; login -&gt; sh VS kernel -&gt; init -&gt; sshd -&gt; sh). While this is also possible in AppArmor it is quite a lot more manual work and more difficult to reason about.\n\nTOMOYO also has much nicer tools than either of the more well known MACs. SELinux has given MAC a bad name as being hard and laborious to manage. If instead of SELinux people would be first introduced to TOMOYO they would probably be much more inclined to implement a MAC.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It is relied upon by thousands with visual impairments, and those with reading disabilities - myself included. You must be new to HPR as we have been using espeak for years, and were only recently able to negotiate a contract with Lyn (text2wave/festival) after her noncompete-agreements from the lottalinuxlinks.com podcast expired ;-).\n\nUnfortunately the site you posted left me wanting when it came to hearing the other side of the story.

Be sure to mention we only use Free Software for the recording [5], and that we can release it under the CC-BY-NC-SA[6] if desired.

That is not the case with RMS with regards to the FSF. He will forever be associated with the free software movement and, by implication, the FSF.\n\nOn that basis engineering his resignation on the strength of his comments on social and political issues did nothing to protect the reputation of the free software movement. All it achieved was to salve the consciences of the other FSF board members. How damaged was the free software movement anyway?\n\nMost people outside the FLOSS world have never heard of RMS so his sometimes distasteful, but sometimes thought-provoking views would have no bearing on their decisions to adopt open source software.\n\nPeople in the FLOSS world know RMS for his eccentricities, along with his visionary genius. I suspect that while many publicly feign shock at his outbursts, for most it is just \"RMS being RMS\" followed by an attempt to get any images conjured up by some of his ideas out of their heads.\n\nIf the FSF fundamentally stands for anything it is freedom, so to sideline somebody for exercising their right to personal opinions and free speech seems a bit incongruous. Given that getting rid of RMS was never going to distance the FSF from him, they would have been better to have taken the view - even in the form of public statements if necessary - that other FSF board members abhor some of his views on non-technical matters but totally support his right to hold and express those views. In these days of \"cancel culture\" when people are dismissed from jobs or prevented from speaking in public for fear of what they might say it would have been a refreshing change to see an organisation defending the right to free speech instead of just taking the path of least resistance.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It doesn't violate any free speech value to say you can believe whatever despicable things you want, you can advocate for any despicable thing you want, but nobody else is obligated to support you or be allied with you. It's not cancel culture. It's being responsible for the ignorance he spews culture. \n\nAs for how the FSF is damaged for it, look at how many organizations have pulled their support. Nobody is bigger than an organization unless the organization allows itself to be subsumed to a cult of personality. It rarely works out well. Part of the reason that the FSF is useless is because they have allowed themselves to be so beholden to a useless repugnant toad like Stallman who pushes a majority of people away. If you want an idea to grow, it helps not to be led by somebody who intentionally spews reprehensible nonsense that pushes everybody else away. Stallman is a toxic excuse for a human being.

The free software community as it stands has good and as discussed well guarded principles with no compromise. While this is admirable it is also what is killing the movement. \n\nLike language all movements must eventually morph or evolve over time or they die off, it is completely acceptable to maintain a core set of tenets of course, but having a figurehead who uses the internet in bizarre and arcane ways makes free software like more a paranoid nest of conspiracy theorists than it does to make technological progress by freeing the user from the constraints of mega corporations. \n\nFree software is inevitably political but the mocking and jeering of people who still use proprietary software scared off companies and created the open source movement, which if anything made it easier for mega corporations to profit off of the collectivised free labour of programmers who cared enough to donate their time.\n\nTo me the free software stalwarts were the progenitors of their own worst enemy, which is open source. They allowed it to happen themselves and fostered the likes of Google and Facebook. The FSF concentrates too much on acting like a single-state communist party with it's attention focused on creating a cult of personality around Stallman. \n\nI agree the roots of the movement today should reflect more social needs, creating software for the good of the people even if that makes software socialist.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

When performance matters, or when the dataset is very large, you might want to use `np.select`. For instance, when using `np.select` on your example here, the output was 10x faster on my PC.\n\n```\n%timeit df.apply(Scorelevel, axis=1)\n\n448 &micro;s &plusmn; 2.88 &micro;s per loop (mean &plusmn; std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\n```\n\n```\n%timeit np.select(cond_list, choice_list, default='Require Activation')\n\n55.6 &micro;s &plusmn; 440 ns per loop (mean &plusmn; std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\n```\n\nIn many cases, the readability can trump the need for speed, but just wanted to give a counter-point.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I was a grad student in Arizona working with the gamma-ray group at SAO's Whipple Observatory (just south of Tucson). My first task was to develop a tracking system for the 10m Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope. We used Forth running on a Z-80 daughter board hosted by an Apple II. This same hardware was used to control a 24\" telescope. That system was developed by a fellow who had worked for SAO's Satellite Tracking Program. In fact, several other staff members at Whipple had traveled the planet installing, operating and maintaining the Baker-Nunn cameras used to photograph satellites and determine their orbital elements.\n\nThe amusing thing is that a couple of years after I graduated they replaced the Apple II with a PC and tried to reverse engineer the Forth code. Given that the tracking code wasn't all that complicated this was sheer insanity. My experience with Forth is that even your own code became rapidly inscrutable.

However, pwd is also very handy for scripting. Bear in mind that scripts don't have a prompt. ;-)\n\nPretend you are in directory A, and the script is in directory B. So in the terminal you enter B/script to run it. Now within that script, the variable $0 contains that calling string, i.e. B/script. But if you call pwd in that script, it returns A(!). So if you use ./ as path for your dump files, that means that the file will be created at your pwd.\n\nI often write quick-n-dirty scripts for one-off tasks and they tend to use relative paths for simplicity. In such cases I use the following line at the start of the script:\ncd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"\nThis changes the script's current directory to where it is actually located. The quotes are there to handle spaces in path names and they are a good habit to acquire. (I'm kind of a language purist and don't like filenames riddled with underscores.

For fiction it doesn't really matter, but as you discuss, page numbers from the physical books are still pretty important in academia where we are expected to cite our sources.

Organisers would often apologise for their apparent shortcomings and make sure he got a good seat, freebies and even a free ticket for a forthcoming event.\n\nAn episode dedicated to this often overlooked and rare skill could be particularly popular - as long as listeners don't get too inspired and wind up behind bars!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Where were directions on prevention and treatments?   CoGo mentions Vitamin D.  This parallels my findings on prevention; zinc also turns up in my research.  Big pharma is making big dollars on this event.  And as mentioned in this episode, an even more nefarious agenda may be happening than mere $ profit.

Many of the vaccines use methods of delivering\nor generating the spike protein in order to \"teach\" the immune system what to\nbe alert to.

Yes, anaphylactic\nshock can result from an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself - as it can\nfrom peanuts, eggs, insect bites or seafood for example.

One of the best accessibility features of ebook formats and ebook readers is the user's option to change font size.

Of course it's not anything like as commonly taught in schools anymore, but it's still there in the background, serving as the model against which the grammar of the vernacular has traditionally been constructed. For the Sclavonic languages, such as Russian, the paradigm is Classical Greek.\n\nIn Latin, there is of course a verb \"habere\" meaning \"to have\" (as well as \"tenere\", \"to hold\"), but it is common to use the copula or being-verb with the dative. In other words, \"I have it\" or \"it belongs to me\" is often expressed with \"id mihi est\", quasi-literally translated into English as \"it to-me is\".\n\nInterestingly, I have read that, in many languages, whatever \"have\" constructions exist tend to be taken over by the verb meaning \"hold\" or \"grasp\". An obvious example is the way that, in Spanish for example, the verb derived from \"tenere\" is used to mean \"hold\", while the Latin \"habere\" has essentially vanished. English cognates such as \"tenure\", \"tenancy\", and so on also show a movement from the concrete to the abstract.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

How you express them is where courtesy comes in. There is a world of difference  between \"If you look at the online manuals you should find the information that will solve your problem\" and \"RTFM!\"\n\nYou'll probably be aware of the controversy about Richard Stallman's ejection from the FSF and subsequent readmission. This was a result of his expressing what most people felt were distasteful ideas. Very little of what followed was criticism of RMS' views based on rational, level-headed argument. It was all about personal insult and trying to shut RMS down, saying he shouldn't have expressed his views. There was no respect of his right of free speech. Much as I similarly rejected most of what RMS had said, the episode demonstrated to me that even in the world of \"free culture\" that we claim to support the adherence to the right of true free speech is as tenuous and conditional as it is in wider society.\n\nI have asked many questions on free software forums over the years and generally found nothing but help and courtesy. However, every now and then I've come across respondents whose primary aim is to show how clever they are and to belittle my relative lack of knowledge. They are the people who give FLOSS a bad image. On the plus side, though, in the same way as you, me and everyone else come to realise that these jerks don't represent the majority I think most newbies will as well, provided they don't encounter one on their first ever request for help.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

A few observations if I may.\n\nThe show focused on the concept of freedom of speech from a US centric perspective. It's important to remember that other (democratic) countries have their own laws\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country\n\nHaving time to consider your points, I feel it's fair to say that the Linux Foundation should be running Linux on their computers. Would Steve Jobs be seen in front of a Windows computer, or Bill Gates a Mac ? It's' just bad business to not run your own products.\n\nFurthermore the \"Shur Mac is Unix\" ideology is dangerous and can be shown to be damaging to the community by focusing people on convenience over moral values. Case in point. Despite the fact that so many \"Linux\" developers run Mac Books, it is still one of the most under supported platforms out there. I tried to get Linux to run on a MacBook with the same specs and release date as my Dell. While there were many issues with the Dell that have been fixed over the years, it's still not possible to get a MacBook to run Linux. This is a direct quote from a developer I asked for help. \"I actually gave up on Fedora on my macbook, too many things are broken (wifi, audio, webcam).\"\n\nI also do not agree that we should welcome developers of closed or even open core applications. This is akin to McDonalds expecting a warm welcome in a vegan club because they put lettuces on a Big Mac.\n\nDevelopers and the community have a right to a belief in Free Libre and Open Source software, the Commons and related views. It is valid that they should not be welcoming with open arms developments that run against that belief. Provided of course that it is done with courtesy.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I keep meaning to get deeper into it but haven't yet.\n\nI'm surprised to hear that VAX Fortran was the recommended language. We took delivery of a two node cluster (both 8700's I think) in 1987. This came with a fair bit of training in Reading and West Gorton (in Manchester), and we had some consultancy available to us to get us started doing the stuff we needed to do. The cluster came with VAX/VMS version 4.x I think.\n\nOne of the consultants recommended DEC Pascal for our system-level projects, and wrote us some example code to get us up and running. That's where I got the impression that Pascal was their most complete language at the time (other than low level stuff like BLISS, which we hadn't bought). We did use Fortran too, and I drew the short straw and ended up teaching it to various students - we ran service courses in the early days.\n\nJust as an aside, one of the then Digital consultants lives a few doors away from me. I have tried to get him to record a chat with me about the DEC times, but I haven't convinced him yet!\n\nAh, the manuals!

What a nightmare! I basically had to remove everything to get to the keyboard, and even then I wasn't able to replace the keyboard because the board with the ribbon was glued on.

I have given talks where there are attendees that are only there owing to having been told that they must be there (typically by their boss).  Body language usually gives these people away.  Once they are recognized as hostile, they can mostly be ignored, allowing the speaker to focus on the people who indeed have chosen to be there.  However, the hostile attendee is very rare.\n\nI have found, when including humour, it is best to avoid a pause after the humour is delivered.  There is a tendency to pause to allow the audience to respond with laughter, however, if the humour does not succeed, the pause will be very awkward.  It is much better to go straight to the next statement after the humour.  If the humour worked and there is laughter, a pause mid-sentence (post humour) is fine.  Start the interrupted sentence over when the laughter diminishes and all is good.  If the humour did not work, the lack of a pause allows the audience to continue listening and often not even notice that there was a unsuccessful attempt at humour and the speaker does not suffer the embarrassment of appearing to try to be funny.  Pauses are good, but tricky when they follow humour.\n\n\nJust some thoughts from listening to this very good episode.  \n\n\nCheers!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

They don't have any of their own towers. \n\n2. Claiming that Google is throttling your connection because YouTube is fast and transfers from your home server are slow is a pretty big leap. YouTube content is served from a massive CDN which has peering agreements with ISPs all over the world. That content is going be served blazing fast to almost anywhere. Transfers over an ssh connection from a little desktop on a residential connection to a Chromebook tethered to a cell phone will never be comparable. \n\n3. 2FA has little to do with vendor lock in and everything to do with security. I don't own any Android devices. My iPhone and iPad can both be used as the 2nd factor for Google 2FA without issue. \n\n4. Google has nothing to do with QR codes at all. \n\nI could go on but I think you get the point. I don't want to see fact check banners on episodes and I don't want to see posters censored.

I miss the vast quantities of those independent websites such as Geocities that you mentioned. I almost forgot how poor coded they were.  I&rsquo;d sometimes see text overwritten with graphics on top or other text.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to complain on that issue, as my own personal website might not be written much better, but it&rsquo;s mine and I&rsquo;m learning as I go along.\n\nThose small sites though, far less common than days gone by had a vibe that is far from the mostly corporate based sites today. It was nice when you&rsquo;d see a description of what people were doing from their point of view.  A recipe from a grandmother, a hike along a favorite trail, a little known but much loved music group, games, stories, poems.  Many graced with gifs such as dancing flames on a torch, dancing animals, or fantasy castles and dragons perhaps copied from elsewhere. Many had background music from midi files with their electronic tones.\n\nAs you stated about &lsquo;modern&rsquo; sites tending to talk and not listening a lot.  I totally agree.  A problem that I encounter is when doing a web search looking for information the sites often are not a good match with my search terms any more.  Few of the sites offer quality information, most instead being geared for sales (hear them talk).  It&rsquo;s like entering a library to find that it is not a library, but a department store.\n\nSomething I&rsquo;ve recently noticed is that if I look for a particular website (let&rsquo;s say comparing Linux Distros), I can go to several websites and a few of the sites will have identical descriptions &ndash; word for word.  It&rsquo;s a shame to visit site after site to find information not similar, but identical.\n\nWell, thank you for the podcast, Klaatu.  And thanks to HPR\n\nhammerron","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I've had to replace a cell three times recently from the 20 cell battery that I've been using about a year.  \n\nThe spot welding is harder to take apart, they come that way in factory made batteries and you have to pull or cut them off, which usually leaves some metal still attached.  For this reason it is better to use solder for older cells in my opinion.\n\nAs for safety, I am tempted to clamp my solder iron to a cell and leave it on maximum heat for 5 minutes to see what happens, probably nothing spectacular.  I only heat for about 10 seconds or so max because I don't want to damage it's capacity.  The metal of the cell itself acts as kind of a heat sink so it doesn't get as hot as a small component would, and soldering irons are built to melt solder. I've done over 100 solders on to bare cells without mishap or loss in capacity. \n\nThe main danger is cutting yourself while taking apart a battery pack, the conductor strips are thin and very sharp when you cut them.  Other hazards are shorting stuff out with your metal cutter and seeing bright sparks. I once punctured one of the flat cells by accident and it started to get hot and smoke and smelled awful, but I can't see that happening with 18650s.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

I had never thought to speed up podcasts before. I have the opposite problem when listening. I am always missing things, or wanting to pause to take a note. I will try speeding up some of my podcasts using Change Tempo.

I think I will give it a try again after your description of the workflow.\n\nI also use Audacity to mod podcasts. I am doing it for slightly different reasons. I like to cut out commercials, and segments I don't like. I am not sure if Limiter is a standard Audacity effect or a Ladspa or Nyquist plugin, but it is a great substitute for Amplify/Normalize. When set to \"Soft Limiter\" it acts like a fast riding volume control. It increases the \"power\" massively without clipping like Amplify does.\n\nA typical starting point for settings for Limiter would be something like:\n\nType: Soft Limit\nInput Gain (mono/Left): 3.00dB\nLimit to: -0.1\nHold (ms): 1.0\n\nI separate my automated steps, and do Limiting manually for good results (I like to get MAXIMUM VOLUME because I listen to a lot of podcasts in the car with the windows open).

It's an excellent little player.\n\nSpeaking of the preprocessing, there is no need to do that if you install the open source Rockbox firmware on the player, https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SansaClip. It works great and has a lot of features! There is a control to increase/decrease pitch and speed while playing; you need to enable the Timestretch option to change them separately (https://download.rockbox.org/daily/manual/rockbox-sansaclipplus/rockbox-buildch4.html#x7-640004.3.3). It took me years before I figured out it was possible to separate the two.\n\nAlso great for podcasts are: auto resume from the previously paused place, and the ability to make the left/right buttons skip N seconds instead of to the prev/next track.\n\nHave a good day!","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Great show and very thought provoking. \n\nYou missed one type of friendship that applies to me and, I dare say, many others.\n\nI grew up and went to school in London and became one of a group of 7 \"mates\". We never used the term \"friends\" in case we were deemed \"soft\" - crazy I know. Over the years we have all moved away from each other, in one case to the other side of the world, so we often only meet one another once or twice a year, sometimes not even that, and don't even converse by phone or messaging much in between. Despite that we all know that we can totally rely on one another should the need arise, and when we do meet the intervening months or years simply have no relevance.\n\nApart from my immediate family, of course, these people are closer to me than anybody else but the need to be in constant contact just doesn't exist. It's the polar opposite of people who are constantly on Facebook communicating with \"friends\" they've never met, and really know nothing about with any certainty.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Where have we heard that before, right? \nSeriously, if you are an adult having a problem with the fact that people exchange nudes in their sexual discovery journey then that is just your own moral problem, do not project that on the rest of the world please. People have done that about sex, drugs, music, religious believes, cultural habits, and pretty much everything we humans design to entertain ourselves and to carry out our identity into the world. Saying \"Don't do that\" really is totally random moral stance since what is found to be offensive in your part of the world might be totally innocent behavior where I live and vice versa. \nSo, again, because repetition seems to work for Coca-Cola: don't project your own random moral objections onto the world.

A big cause for this confusion is that Windows shows amounts based on binary calculation, but writes out the ten-based unit names, i.e. it says \"4,37 GB\", but it should say \"4.37 GiB\".\n\nThere is also a difference between lowercase and uppercase b.

The motivation is jealousy, greed or even just posturing by a leader to look strong in the eyes of his own population.\n\nAt a non-governmental level, of course, collaboration and information sharing is much more productive than competition.

That means, indeed, going where a potential audience might be, and shouting about HPR.\nTikTok, YouTube and SnapChat are where the kidz hang out, as well as Discord as you rightly pointed out.\nGiven limited resources, perhaps we should drop LinkedIn and Facebook in favour of one or more of those more zippy platforms? Ken already has plans for YouTube, I see.\nWhile anyone with a few minutes could post episodes to those 'channels' (see how down with the lingo I am?!), I think that automating the process would be a good starting point. That's beyond my skill set, but I would bet that there are some listeners who could manage to knock something together?\nAs a community podcast, it's a community responsibility to get out there and engage, actively, where we can, to bring in new listeners and therfore contributers.

We are indeed &ldquo;present&rdquo; on X, Twitter, Facebook and Youtube, but are we &ldquo;active&rdquo; there?\n\nWe spend easily 90% of our time working on community engagement in some form or another, and I would conservatively say that we have invested thousands of hours into it over the years. Each community requires a tailored approach because it is not realistic to expect the same approach on LinkedIn to work on TikTok. Therefore we actively engage to a level and extent that is appropriate for a given platform, as dictated by the terms and conditions, the behavioral norms and operation rules of the community there, while keeping in mind the return on investment each platform delivers.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that some channels do not lend themselves to providing contributions. As an example, FaceBook and LinkedIn have zero engagement. The feedback I get from people I tried to engage with on LinkedIn is that they don't want their employer to know they are associated with a project with the word Hacker in it's title. While several Facebook groups responded to my request with a one line link to some of the more unsavory shows we have hosted. We maintain a presence as an avenue for contact.\n\nWe have been on Twitter since August 2008 and have more than 10K post there with 1,019 Followers. To this day we comment and respond to every show, and actively follow up on engagement. To my knowledge we did not get a single new host via Twitter. \n\nCommunity building takes a lot of time and it can be years before you see the results of your work. So please don't just setup an account on a service if you are not willing to maintain it for the long run. It's one thing to not have a presence on a platform, it's another to have a defunct inactive presence.\n\nBy far the best way to engage is talking to people about HPR and asking them to contribute. This applies to online interactions, but is especially true of in person contacts.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

One could be forgiven looking as the software choices we use, and are getting engagement on, that we are bias towards FLOSS platforms but what you are seeing is \"Effect\" and not the \"Cause\". Starting out our policy was to use existing platforms as much as possible, we were not afraid to use and pay for proprietary software. However in our nearly 19 years of operation we saw that companies come and go. With proprietary software you are left high and dry while, with FLOSS software you can find someone to host it. \n\nThe show focused on our IRC channel, and while it's true we did have a thriving community there for a while, that stopped when Freenode got taken over. We maintain a presence on IRC, but most people have moved to Matrix where the contributions and feedback has been very good.\n\nYou suggested (possibly ironically) replacing IRC with a BBS. From 2005 each show was automatically posted for discussion there. Unfortunately that community was abandoned when the corporation producing the software stopped support. It was shut down after it was compromised, and then the site got over run with spam.\n\nOur comment system was a third party application running on cPanel. The corporation producing the commenting software stopped support, and after it was compromised the site got over run with spam. For a time the entire HPR domain was blocked as a spam site. Dave and I were able to salvage the database, and put in very robust checks on code that is now released undo AGPLv3.0. Since then cPanel upped their prices to such an extent that we migrated to a static site also available under the AGPL, but we were able to just move the MailMan operation to a service which we pay for.\n\nIn 2011 we jumped on the Google+ bandwagon and did get a lot of contributions, until it was shut down in 2019.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

So keeping in the spirit of \"freedom\" we might want to focus on Mastodon (and if possible a link with Threads).

This way we can encourage them to record their own show\n\n4: TALK about HPR in non HPR podcasts: Do we ever have hosts that are guests on other podcasts ? Talking about a podcast \"anyone can join\" is a great showtopic for other podcasts too.\n\n5: Record a Youtube tutorial on HOW to record and upload a show.

I've been thinking a lot lately about the exploitation of workers and what kind of economic systems could provide everyone with a dignified standard of living (as a layperson, my very loose understanding is that Universal Basic Income is a frontrunner in that space). Thanks so much for giving examples of other writings on this topic. I'd love to hear more.\n\nI do think there is a second problem with generative \"AI\" that, while less urgent than the first, still matters--burying good work in a flood of bad harms both artists and audiences. At least for some artists, the hope that the work finds an audience is an important motivator. For audiences, encountering a work you love and knowing it was made by a person with a perspective affords the opportunity to find more works from that person and better appreciate that perspective. The ability to create low quality works coupled with systems that prioritize clicks (search engines, engagement-based social media algorithms, etc.) are a recipe for dramatically increasing the difficulty of finding good art.\n\nAs a small aside, I discovered one of my favorite visual artists only because they were commissioned to create a logo--something that might never have happened if generative \"AI\" had been pervasive ten years ago.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

We had to take my father to Buffalo General Hospital for tests. But it turned into an all day event.  I was sitting in the waiting room, when I discovered that the hospital was having a used book fair.  I went, and picked out a book \"Danny Dunn and the Anti-Gravity Paint\".  I had no money, and the cashier gave me the book for free.  The book drew me in, and I was hooked on science fiction.\n\nI also remember trips to the Buffalo downtown library.

If it were up to me all shows would go into one queue, and they'd get scheduled following some set of transparent rules, automatically if possible. Reserving a date would be only at least 1 or 2 months out. Then you could do things like ensure new hosts always get the nth slot from the day they upload. The only issue is we'd lose the psychological effect of the reserve queue as a buffer between today and the end of the project. The problem with the current way is that, since we talk about technology and hosts are always learning more things, it is nearly impossible for a show to be evergreen enough to sit in the reserve queue as long as they usually do.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

On several occasions I was strongly advised by locals not to help anybody in distress who may require hospitalisation. The reason was that if the patient could not afford to pay the bills (which almost certainly they couldn't) the person summoning an ambulance would be held liable for all costs.\n\nHealthcare at the time was supposedly free, but it was so ineffective that the patient would be long dead before a public-sector ambulance arrived, hence resorting to private alternatives.\n\nBecause of the \"entertaining\" standard of driving, car crashes were regular occurrences, but rarely would you see any bystanders do anything more than just look.

This was read sequentially. The key was followed by a long integer which was the file pointer offset in another file containing the actual data - again one for \"A\", \"B\" etc.\n\nFor fixed length data I was amazed at how fast retrieval was, but it was impractical for anything else. An update that altered the length of just one record in the data file required recalculating all the file pointers in that group.\n\nAlso, the lack of a flexible query mechanism limited its use. \n\nI recall that VAX/VMS used indexed files, but the index and the data were somehow combined into a single file. Super fast retrieval but, again, no query mechanism beyond the record key.\n\nIt was an interesting exercise but I've found SQLite to be the ideal way of handling data in standalone applications.","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Thanks for the comments on the show. I guess I should have been clearer when I compared the synchronization features of Tmux to that of ClusterSSH. While I could have done the commands using ClusterSSH, I preferred leaving the multiplexing to Tmux on the FreeBSD box with the single SSH session from whichever client I was using to perform the duplication. The other reason I did it this way over using ClusterSSH is because I don't always need to SSH to the box since it's in my office, and doing it my way allows me to log in to the box directly from the console and then pull up the Tmux session to see the status of the duplication or even begin another session after swapping out the USB flash drives themselves.\n\nAs mentioned by Ken, scripting this is a possibility, but we all know not to treat dd lightly as that can be a recipe for disaster. I was thinking of hairylarry's technique of using abcde, but since that's only for ripping CDs, it won't work here.

I kept using it when we started using MS Exchange. I think from the earliest time Thunderbird had a mechanism for deleting messages based on their age or the number in a folder.\n\nI filter all my email arriving from several mail services into a number of inboxes into a hierarchy of folders. For each folder with transient messages I right click on it, and select the 'Retention Policy' tab. There I either set a date-related deletion policy or a count-based one. I always enable \"Always keep starred messages\".\n\nThis seems to be a good way to handle message deletion - for my needs anyway. Some of my filters add stars to messages (as well as sometimes tagging them) before saving them in folders with deletion rules, because I really want to keep them for a long time, while I don't care about others in that folder.\n\nMaybe I should do a show about my 30+ years of email experiences at some point!\n\nDave\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

My first sign was that someone had opened a web browser on the desktop (which I never did) so I could see they were just using it to browse for content they were blocked from accessing. It wasn't even dodgy stuff, just personal sites.\n\nI rebuilt the machine and turned off RDP, but that gave me a real scare.\n\nYou said about using a VPN but needing to make sure it's up to date, can I suggest looking at one of the mesh VPN products, like Tailscale, Nebula or Netbird? I used Tailscale to provide remote support to my aunt and to share content on my home network via a proxy on my VPS.\n\nAt work, I'm investigating Netbird, which is similar to Tailscale, but has the control plane hosted on a web server you control. I've previously used Nebula, but after one mishap with the PKI, I realised I couldn't trust myself to run that in the way I needed to to be managed.\n\nAll the very best, and thanks again for the content!\n","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

It needs a library called 'TagLib' (and a Perl module called 'Audio::TagLib') which can be difficult to install successfully.\n\nA while ago I made a binary version of the script, which Ken and Honkey used, but I recently discovered there was a problem with that as well. The tool that packaged the script includes all the Perl modules the script needs, but not the external libraries. This wasn't obvious (to me anyway at the time) - the binary just looked for them on the system it was being run on - but over time it became a problem as OS stuff was upgraded.\n\nI recently found a way to ensure that all external libraries were packaged with the modules and the script, and this solved the problems Ken and Honkey mentioned in this episode. They both have updated binary versions, but I have yet to update the GitHub version. I also plan to do an HPR show about this stuff soon...","last_changed":"2025-02-24 14:50:53"},

Listening to your show gave me a breath of fresh air: \"No, this is not a must for free software\". In one example, as you gave: the software may have its own web page, freely made (to be known), but entirely maintained by exchanges of talk and code by e-mail, in a mailing list.\n\nAll you brought here gave me a perspective of much more simplicity, rethinking what I envision as free software today. Because, many times, many projects, there are issues opened, and no answer ever, even with development going on, like saying: \"we are in github, with all the resources it brings, by inertia (because everybody does), but we don't give attention to users or developers)\". A talk you gave to rethink what developers want with their software, and do according to the objetives.

I only did not try yet my cheap lavalier microphone.\n\nI'm almost sure that, for this one, I used: Laptop computer (Galaxy Book4 Ultra) with Behringer UMC-22 (USB audio interface) and Audio-Technica PRO63 (dynamic XLR microphone).\nThis mic is specific for instruments, but it was an Audio-Technica at a good price point at the time, so getting it and the interface years ago was satisfactory.\n\nWhen I have time, I play with compression, normalization and, if I'm absolutely in the mood (as it demands time, effort), equalization. I think I've done it here, and *did not* cut errors nor changed the pace of the talk by cutting silences.

Thanks very much for the report on the study.

So it's nice that we have a first conclusion on the topic. \n\nAs the law is recent in Brazil as a whole (states were already regulating it sparsely), *we only have perceptions of students and teachers, and specialists talk*, no \"clear-data\" studies; but I would bet one to be conducted here still 2025 or beginning of 2026, with data collected orderly and systematically.

It's a long while ago, and I may be wrong.\n\nAnyway, your description of this aspect of Readline makes me want to enable VI mode :-)","last_changed":"2025-05-17 20:43:50"},

It was good to follow along with your thoughts.\n\nYes, I agree with Paulj that 'rsync' is all about updating the destination with differences detected in the source, so the 'find' seems redundant.\n\nHowever, it's interesting to examine the '-print0' option. I have used it when I have files with spaces (and other weirdnesses) in their names, which I need to process. Many other commands accept null-terminated names, so this can be very useful.\n\nHere's a case in an HPR script I wrote a long time ago when I was a \"Janitor\":\n\nmapfile -d '' -t pix < \\\n    <(find \"$SHOWDIR\" -maxdepth 1 -regextype egrep -regex '.*\\.(jpg|JPG|png|PNG)' -print0 |\\\n        sort -z)\n\nIt fills an array 'pix' with picture file names, avoiding problems with spaces in names (hopefully anyway!).\n\nThe \"null\" characters generated by find are non-printable, but you could save the output and view it with an editor, or with 'od' or 'cat -v' to \"see\" them.\n\nYou mentioned 'ACL'. This stands for Access Control List, a POSIX feature which gives more fine-grained access control to filesystem objects.\n\nLooking forward to more shows like this :-)","last_changed":"2025-05-17 20:45:06"},

But then after the reunification someone from the southern part of Germany introduced me to Hefeweizen, and wow, beer CAN taste good.\n\nErdinger is good, but when you sometime get the chance, you should test Schöfferhofer, Störterbecker or the dark variant of Franziskaner.\nAnd, don't believe, they all come from Bavaria! Two of those I named aren't from the home of Oktoberfest.","last_changed":"2025-10-22 11:57:57"},

They should be drunk from the fridge (or if draft they are served chilled). Great for a summer evening in the Biergarten!\nIn my opinion, all german weizenbiers of this type are hefeweizen. Based on my experience in Germany (my wife is German and comes from the south), if you ask for a Weizenbier, you will get a helleshefeweizen beer. Often you will get beer from a local brewery, and not from the big brewers. That beer doesn't make it to the UK (sadly).\nThere are actually three types of hefeweizen:\n- Dunkel (dark)\n- Helles (light - what you have both drunk)\n- Krystall - this is Helleshefeweizen with the yeast and wheat proteins filtered out. Often drunk with a slice of lemon in the top.\nI agree with your comment about not mixing it- I have had many great evenings treating these as a session beer!\n\nLooking forward to the next episode!","last_changed":"2025-10-22 18:00:30"}]
